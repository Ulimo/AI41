\section{Summary}
This work have been about implementing and testing a word predictor in the purpose of finding out what makes an effective one. The definition of an effective word predictor was defined as one that could reduce the number of key-strokes needed to complete a sentence. This resulted in an implementation which tryies out common techniques for improving performance in a word predictor. The use of KYLM and Open NLP for generate the N-grams probabilities respectively the part of speech tagging was the foundational stones for this work. On top of that development of grammar constraints and context recognition was made as mean of conducting tests to see what could make a word predictor more effective. The tests in this project concluded that grammar constrains didnâ€™t seem to benefit the effectiveness of the word predictor while context recognition proved to be, given that the corpus contains usable n-grams.
