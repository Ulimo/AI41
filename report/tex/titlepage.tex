Word predictors play a central role in NLP as processing can be improved by good word prediction given earlier input. This study focus on the problem of designing effective word predictors in the terms of functionalities. The experiments take a qualitative inductive approach to evaluate the effect of probability smoothing techniques, grammar constraints and context recognition for a set of simulated situations. Results include that the use of smoothing techniques, especially in combination context recognition, can improve effectiveness of word prediction. The implemented grammar constraints seemed beneficial in theory, but were hard to implement and decreased efectiveness in reality.
