\section{Introduction}
This study was initiated by doing research to gather the knowledge required to understand the basis of how word predictors work. The know-how to be able to implement and evaluate such a program was also needed. From the research, we were able to formulate the hypotheses mentioned above, as well as a project plan for implementing a word predictor that we could test to find support or disproof of our hypotheses.\\

For the implementation, an object oriented approach was taken. The language of choice was initially C++. As research went on, however, most libraries that could be used seemed to be written in Java. The programming language was therefore changed to the latter.
