\subsection{Keystroke experiment}
This experiment focused on testing the different sentences explained in \emph{test sentences} and how the different techniques applied in the work can change the number of keystrokes needed to complete a sentence. Every column represent if grammar or context was used when counting the number of keystrokes needed.

\subsection{Context recognition}
These tables show different predictions given as the next word for a given sentence with and without context recognition using a case insensitive corpus.
