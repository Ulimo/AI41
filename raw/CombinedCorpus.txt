Mr . Phileas Fogg lived , in 1872 , at No . 7 , Saville Row , Burlington Gardens , the house in which Sheridan died in 1814 .  He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club , though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage , about whom little was known , except that he was a polished man of the world .  People said that he resembled Byron--at least that his head was Byronic; but he was a bearded , tranquil Byron , who might live on a thousand years without growing old .  Certainly an Englishman , it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was a Londoner .  He was never seen on Change , nor at the Bank , nor in the counting-rooms of the City; no ships ever came into London docks of which he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been entered at any of the Inns of Court , either at the Temple , or Lincolns Inn , or Grays Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of Chancery , or in the Exchequer , or the Queens Bench , or the Ecclesiastical Courts .  He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer .  His name was strange to the scientific and learned societies , and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London Institution , the Artisans Association , or the Institution of Arts and Sciences .  He belonged , in fact , to none of the numerous societies which swarm in the English capital , from the Harmonic to that of the Entomologists , founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious insects .  Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform , and that was all .  The way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple enough .  He was recommended by the Barings , with whom he had an open credit . His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current , which was always flush .  Was Phileas Fogg rich ?  Undoubtedly .  But those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune , and Mr . Fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information .  He was not lavish , nor , on the contrary , avaricious; for , whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble , useful , or benevolent purpose , he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously .  He was , in short , the least communicative of men .  He talked very little , and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner .  His daily habits were quite open to observation; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before , that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled .  Had he travelled ?  It was likely , for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it .  He often corrected , with a few clear words , the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard-of travellers , pointing out the true probabilities , and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight , so often did events justify his predictions .  He must have travelled everywhere , at least in the spirit .  It was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from London for many years .  Those who were honoured by a better acquaintance with him than the rest , declared that nobody could pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else .  His sole pastimes were reading the papers and playing whist .  He often won at this game , which , as a silent one , harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went into his purse , being reserved as a fund for his charities .  Mr . Fogg played , not to win , but for the sake of playing .  The game was in his eyes a contest , a struggle with a difficulty , yet a motionless , unwearying struggle , congenial to his tastes .  Phileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children , which may happen to the most honest people; either relatives or near friends , which is certainly more unusual .  He lived alone in his house in Saville Row , whither none penetrated .  A single domestic sufficed to serve him .  He breakfasted and dined at the club , at hours mathematically fixed , in the same room , at the same table , never taking his meals with other members , much less bringing a guest with him; and went home at exactly midnight , only to retire at once to bed .  He never used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured members .  He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row , either in sleeping or making his toilet .  When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring , or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns , and illumined by blue painted windows . When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club--its kitchens and pantries , its buttery and dairy--aided to crowd his table with their most succulent stores; he was served by the gravest waiters , in dress coats , and shoes with swan-skin soles , who proffered the viands in special porcelain , and on the finest linen; club decanters , of a lost mould , contained his sherry , his port , and his cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled with ice , brought at great cost from the American lakes .  If to live in this style is to be eccentric , it must be confessed that there is something good in eccentricity .  The mansion in Saville Row , though not sumptuous , was exceedingly comfortable .  The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but little from the sole domestic , but Phileas Fogg required him to be almost superhumanly prompt and regular .  On this very 2nd of October he had dismissed James Forster , because that luckless youth had brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of eighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor , who was due at the house between eleven and half-past .  Phileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair , his feet close together like those of a grenadier on parade , his hands resting on his knees , his body straight , his head erect; he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours , the minutes , the seconds , the days , the months , and the years .  At exactly half-past eleven Mr . Fogg would , according to his daily habit , quit Saville Row , and repair to the Reform .  A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where Phileas Fogg was seated , and James Forster , the dismissed servant , appeared .  The new servant , said he .  A young man of thirty advanced and bowed .  You are a Frenchman , I believe , asked Phileas Fogg , and your name is John ?  Jean , if monsieur pleases , replied the newcomer , Jean Passepartout , a surname which has clung to me because I have a natural aptness for going out of one business into another .  I believe Im honest , monsieur , but , to be outspoken , Ive had several trades .  Ive been an itinerant singer , a circus-rider , when I used to vault like Leotard , and dance on a rope like Blondin .  Then I got to be a professor of gymnastics , so as to make better use of my talents; and then I was a sergeant fireman at Paris , and assisted at many a big fire .  But I quitted France five years ago , and , wishing to taste the sweets of domestic life , took service as a valet here in England .  Finding myself out of place , and hearing that Monsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact and settled gentleman in the United Kingdom , I have come to monsieur in the hope of living with him a tranquil life , and forgetting even the name of Passepartout .  Passepartout suits me , responded Mr . Fogg .  You are well recommended to me; I hear a good report of you .  You know my conditions ?  Yes , monsieur .  Good!  What time is it ?  Twenty-two minutes after eleven , returned Passepartout , drawing an enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket .  You are too slow , said Mr . Fogg .  Pardon me , monsieur , it is impossible--  You are four minutes too slow .  No matter; its enough to mention the error .  Now from this moment , twenty-nine minutes after eleven , a .m . , this Wednesday , 2nd October , you are in my service .  Phileas Fogg got up , took his hat in his left hand , put it on his head with an automatic motion , and went off without a word .  Passepartout heard the street door shut once; it was his new master going out .  He heard it shut again; it was his predecessor , James Forster , departing in his turn .  Passepartout remained alone in the house in Saville Row .     Chapter II  IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT IS CONVINCED THAT HE HAS AT LAST FOUND HIS IDEAL   Faith , muttered Passepartout , somewhat flurried , Ive seen people at Madame Tussauds as lively as my new master!  Madame Tussauds people , let it be said , are of wax , and are much visited in London; speech is all that is wanting to make them human .  During his brief interview with Mr . Fogg , Passepartout had been carefully observing him .  He appeared to be a man about forty years of age , with fine , handsome features , and a tall , well-shaped figure; his hair and whiskers were light , his forehead compact and unwrinkled , his face rather pale , his teeth magnificent .  His countenance possessed in the highest degree what physiognomists call repose in action , a quality of those who act rather than talk .  Calm and phlegmatic , with a clear eye , Mr . Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure which Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas .  Seen in the various phases of his daily life , he gave the idea of being perfectly well-balanced , as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer . Phileas Fogg was , indeed , exactitude personified , and this was betrayed even in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men , as well as in animals , the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions .  He was so exact that he was never in a hurry , was always ready , and was economical alike of his steps and his motions .  He never took one step too many , and always went to his destination by the shortest cut; he made no superfluous gestures , and was never seen to be moved or agitated .  He was the most deliberate person in the world , yet always reached his destination at the exact moment .  He lived alone , and , so to speak , outside of every social relation; and as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction , and that friction retards , he never rubbed against anybody .  As for Passepartout , he was a true Parisian of Paris .  Since he had abandoned his own country for England , taking service as a valet , he had in vain searched for a master after his own heart .  Passepartout was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Moliere with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest fellow , with a pleasant face , lips a trifle protruding , soft-mannered and serviceable , with a good round head , such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend .  His eyes were blue , his complexion rubicund , his figure almost portly and well-built , his body muscular , and his physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his younger days . His brown hair was somewhat tumbled; for , while the ancient sculptors are said to have known eighteen methods of arranging Minervas tresses , Passepartout was familiar with but one of dressing his own: three strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet .  It would be rash to predict how Passepartouts lively nature would agree with Mr . Fogg .  It was impossible to tell whether the new servant would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required; experience alone could solve the question .  Passepartout had been a sort of vagrant in his early years , and now yearned for repose; but so far he had failed to find it , though he had already served in ten English houses .  But he could not take root in any of these; with chagrin , he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular , constantly running about the country , or on the look-out for adventure . His last master , young Lord Longferry , Member of Parliament , after passing his nights in the Haymarket taverns , was too often brought home in the morning on policemens shoulders .  Passepartout , desirous of respecting the gentleman whom he served , ventured a mild remonstrance on such conduct; which , being ill-received , he took his leave .  Hearing that Mr . Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant , and that his life was one of unbroken regularity , that he neither travelled nor stayed from home overnight , he felt sure that this would be the place he was after . He presented himself , and was accepted , as has been seen .  At half-past eleven , then , Passepartout found himself alone in the house in Saville Row .  He began its inspection without delay , scouring it from cellar to garret .  So clean , well-arranged , solemn a mansion pleased him; it seemed to him like a snails shell , lighted and warmed by gas , which sufficed for both these purposes .  When Passepartout reached the second story he recognised at once the room which he was to inhabit , and he was well satisfied with it .  Electric bells and speaking-tubes afforded communication with the lower stories; while on the mantel stood an electric clock , precisely like that in Mr . Foggs bedchamber , both beating the same second at the same instant .  Thats good , thatll do , said Passepartout to himself .  He suddenly observed , hung over the clock , a card which , upon inspection , proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house . It comprised all that was required of the servant , from eight in the morning , exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose , till half-past eleven , when he left the house for the Reform Club--all the details of service , the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight , the shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine , and the toilet at twenty minutes before ten .  Everything was regulated and foreseen that was to be done from half-past eleven a .m . till midnight , the hour at which the methodical gentleman retired .  Mr . Foggs wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste .  Each pair of trousers , coat , and vest bore a number , indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing; and the same system was applied to the masters shoes .  In short , the house in Saville Row , which must have been a very temple of disorder and unrest under the illustrious but dissipated Sheridan , was cosiness , comfort , and method idealised .  There was no study , nor were there books , which would have been quite useless to Mr . Fogg; for at the Reform two libraries , one of general literature and the other of law and politics , were at his service .  A moderate-sized safe stood in his bedroom , constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but Passepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere; everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits .  Having scrutinised the house from top to bottom , he rubbed his hands , a broad smile overspread his features , and he said joyfully , This is just what I wanted!  Ah , we shall get on together , Mr . Fogg and I! What a domestic and regular gentleman!  A real machine; well , I dont mind serving a machine .     Chapter III  IN WHICH A CONVERSATION TAKES PLACE WHICH SEEMS LIKELY TO COST PHILEAS FOGG DEAR   Phileas Fogg , having shut the door of his house at half-past eleven , and having put his right foot before his left five hundred and seventy-five times , and his left foot before his right five hundred and seventy-six times , reached the Reform Club , an imposing edifice in Pall Mall , which could not have cost less than three millions .  He repaired at once to the dining-room , the nine windows of which open upon a tasteful garden , where the trees were already gilded with an autumn colouring; and took his place at the habitual table , the cover of which had already been laid for him .  His breakfast consisted of a side-dish , a broiled fish with Reading sauce , a scarlet slice of roast beef garnished with mushrooms , a rhubarb and gooseberry tart , and a morsel of Cheshire cheese , the whole being washed down with several cups of tea , for which the Reform is famous .  He rose at thirteen minutes to one , and directed his steps towards the large hall , a sumptuous apartment adorned with lavishly-framed paintings .  A flunkey handed him an uncut Times , which he proceeded to cut with a skill which betrayed familiarity with this delicate operation .  The perusal of this paper absorbed Phileas Fogg until a quarter before four , whilst the Standard , his next task , occupied him till the dinner hour .  Dinner passed as breakfast had done , and Mr . Fogg re-appeared in the reading-room and sat down to the Pall Mall at twenty minutes before six .  Half an hour later several members of the Reform came in and drew up to the fireplace , where a coal fire was steadily burning .  They were Mr . Foggs usual partners at whist: Andrew Stuart , an engineer; John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin , bankers; Thomas Flanagan , a brewer; and Gauthier Ralph , one of the Directors of the Bank of England--all rich and highly respectable personages , even in a club which comprises the princes of English trade and finance .  Well , Ralph , said Thomas Flanagan , what about that robbery ?  Oh , replied Stuart , the Bank will lose the money .  On the contrary , broke in Ralph , I hope we may put our hands on the robber .  Skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports of America and the Continent , and hell be a clever fellow if he slips through their fingers .  But have you got the robbers description ? asked Stuart .  In the first place , he is no robber at all , returned Ralph , positively .  What! a fellow who makes off with fifty-five thousand pounds , no robber ?  No .  Perhaps hes a manufacturer , then .  The Daily Telegraph says that he is a gentleman .  It was Phileas Fogg , whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers , who made this remark .  He bowed to his friends , and entered into the conversation .  The affair which formed its subject , and which was town talk , had occurred three days before at the Bank of England .  A package of banknotes , to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds , had been taken from the principal cashiers table , that functionary being at the moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and sixpence .  Of course , he could not have his eyes everywhere .  Let it be observed that the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the honesty of the public .  There are neither guards nor gratings to protect its treasures; gold , silver , banknotes are freely exposed , at the mercy of the first comer .  A keen observer of English customs relates that , being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day , he had the curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds . He took it up , scrutinised it , passed it to his neighbour , he to the next man , and so on until the ingot , going from hand to hand , was transferred to the end of a dark entry; nor did it return to its place for half an hour .  Meanwhile , the cashier had not so much as raised his head .  But in the present instance things had not gone so smoothly . The package of notes not being found when five oclock sounded from the ponderous clock in the drawing office , the amount was passed to the account of profit and loss .  As soon as the robbery was discovered , picked detectives hastened off to Liverpool , Glasgow , Havre , Suez , Brindisi , New York , and other ports , inspired by the proffered reward of two thousand pounds , and five per cent . on the sum that might be recovered .  Detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those who arrived at or left London by rail , and a judicial examination was at once entered upon .  There were real grounds for supposing , as the Daily Telegraph said , that the thief did not belong to a professional band .  On the day of the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners , and with a well-to-do air , had been observed going to and fro in the paying room where the crime was committed .  A description of him was easily procured and sent to the detectives; and some hopeful spirits , of whom Ralph was one , did not despair of his apprehension .  The papers and clubs were full of the affair , and everywhere people were discussing the probabilities of a successful pursuit; and the Reform Club was especially agitated , several of its members being Bank officials .  Ralph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to be in vain , for he thought that the prize offered would greatly stimulate their zeal and activity .  But Stuart was far from sharing this confidence; and , as they placed themselves at the whist-table , they continued to argue the matter .  Stuart and Flanagan played together , while Phileas Fogg had Fallentin for his partner .  As the game proceeded the conversation ceased , excepting between the rubbers , when it revived again .  I maintain , said Stuart , that the chances are in favour of the thief , who must be a shrewd fellow .  Well , but where can he fly to ? asked Ralph .  No country is safe for him .  Pshaw!  Where could he go , then ?  Oh , I dont know that .  The world is big enough .  It was once , said Phileas Fogg , in a low tone .  Cut , sir , he added , handing the cards to Thomas Flanagan .  The discussion fell during the rubber , after which Stuart took up its thread .  What do you mean by `once ?  Has the world grown smaller ?  Certainly , returned Ralph .  I agree with Mr . Fogg .  The world has grown smaller , since a man can now go round it ten times more quickly than a hundred years ago .  And that is why the search for this thief will be more likely to succeed .  And also why the thief can get away more easily .  Be so good as to play , Mr . Stuart , said Phileas Fogg .  But the incredulous Stuart was not convinced , and when the hand was finished , said eagerly: You have a strange way , Ralph , of proving that the world has grown smaller .  So , because you can go round it in three months--  In eighty days , interrupted Phileas Fogg .  That is true , gentlemen , added John Sullivan .  Only eighty days , now that the section between Rothal and Allahabad , on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway , has been opened .  Here is the estimate made by the Daily Telegraph:    From London to Suez via Mont Cenis and     Brindisi , by rail and steamboats  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  7 days   From Suez to Bombay , by steamer  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13     From Bombay to Calcutta , by rail  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  3     From Calcutta to Hong Kong , by steamer  . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13     From Hong Kong to Yokohama (Japan) , by steamer  . . . . .  6     From Yokohama to San Francisco , by steamer  . . . . . . . . . 22     From San Francisco to New York , by rail  . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7     From New York to London , by steamer and rail  . . . . . . . . 9                                                          ------     Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 80 days .  Yes , in eighty days! exclaimed Stuart , who in his excitement made a false deal .  But that doesnt take into account bad weather , contrary winds , shipwrecks , railway accidents , and so on .  All included , returned Phileas Fogg , continuing to play despite the discussion .  But suppose the Hindoos or Indians pull up the rails , replied Stuart; suppose they stop the trains , pillage the luggage-vans , and scalp the passengers!  All included , calmly retorted Fogg; adding , as he threw down the cards , Two trumps .  Stuart , whose turn it was to deal , gathered them up , and went on: You are right , theoretically , Mr . Fogg , but practically--  Practically also , Mr . Stuart .  Id like to see you do it in eighty days .  It depends on you .  Shall we go ?  Heaven preserve me!  But I would wager four thousand pounds that such a journey , made under these conditions , is impossible .  Quite possible , on the contrary , returned Mr . Fogg .  Well , make it , then!  The journey round the world in eighty days ?  Yes .  I should like nothing better .  When ?  At once .  Only I warn you that I shall do it at your expense .  Its absurd! cried Stuart , who was beginning to be annoyed at the persistency of his friend .  Come , lets go on with the game .  Deal over again , then , said Phileas Fogg .  Theres a false deal .  Stuart took up the pack with a feverish hand; then suddenly put them down again .  Well , Mr . Fogg , said he , it shall be so: I will wager the four thousand on it .  Calm yourself , my dear Stuart , said Fallentin .  Its only a joke .  When I say Ill wager , returned Stuart , I mean it .    All right , said Mr . Fogg; and , turning to the others , he continued: I have a deposit of twenty thousand at Barings which I will willingly risk upon it .  Twenty thousand pounds! cried Sullivan .  Twenty thousand pounds , which you would lose by a single accidental delay!  The unforeseen does not exist , quietly replied Phileas Fogg .  But , Mr . Fogg , eighty days are only the estimate of the least possible time in which the journey can be made .  A well-used minimum suffices for everything .  But , in order not to exceed it , you must jump mathematically from the trains upon the steamers , and from the steamers upon the trains again .  I will jump--mathematically .  You are joking .  A true Englishman doesnt joke when he is talking about so serious a thing as a wager , replied Phileas Fogg , solemnly .  I will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishes that I will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours , or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes .  Do you accept ?  We accept , replied Messrs . Stuart , Fallentin , Sullivan , Flanagan , and Ralph , after consulting each other .  Good , said Mr . Fogg .  The train leaves for Dover at a quarter before nine .  I will take it .  This very evening ? asked Stuart .  This very evening , returned Phileas Fogg .  He took out and consulted a pocket almanac , and added ,  As today is Wednesday , the 2nd of October , I shall be due in London in this very room of the Reform Club , on Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine p .m .; or else the twenty thousand pounds , now deposited in my name at Barings , will belong to you , in fact and in right , gentlemen .  Here is a cheque for the amount .  A memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties , during which Phileas Fogg preserved a stoical composure .  He certainly did not bet to win , and had only staked the twenty thousand pounds , half of his fortune , because he foresaw that he might have to expend the other half to carry out this difficult , not to say unattainable , project .  As for his antagonists , they seemed much agitated; not so much by the value of their stake , as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their friend .  The clock struck seven , and the party offered to suspend the game so that Mr . Fogg might make his preparations for departure .  I am quite ready now , was his tranquil response .  Diamonds are trumps: be so good as to play , gentlemen .     Chapter IV  IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG ASTOUNDS PASSEPARTOUT , HIS SERVANT   Having won twenty guineas at whist , and taken leave of his friends , Phileas Fogg , at twenty-five minutes past seven , left the Reform Club .  Passepartout , who had conscientiously studied the programme of his duties , was more than surprised to see his master guilty of the inexactness of appearing at this unaccustomed hour; for , according to rule , he was not due in Saville Row until precisely midnight .  Mr . Fogg repaired to his bedroom , and called out , Passepartout!  Passepartout did not reply .  It could not be he who was called; it was not the right hour .  Passepartout! repeated Mr . Fogg , without raising his voice .  Passepartout made his appearance .  Ive called you twice , observed his master .  But it is not midnight , responded the other , showing his watch .  I know it; I dont blame you .  We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes .  A puzzled grin overspread Passepartouts round face; clearly he had not comprehended his master .  Monsieur is going to leave home ?  Yes , returned Phileas Fogg .  We are going round the world .  Passepartout opened wide his eyes , raised his eyebrows , held up his hands , and seemed about to collapse , so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment .  Round the world! he murmured .  In eighty days , responded Mr . Fogg .  So we havent a moment to lose .  But the trunks ? gasped Passepartout , unconsciously swaying his head from right to left .  Well have no trunks; only a carpet-bag , with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me , and the same for you .  Well buy our clothes on the way .  Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak , and some stout shoes , though we shall do little walking .  Make haste!  Passepartout tried to reply , but could not .  He went out , mounted to his own room , fell into a chair , and muttered: Thats good , that is! And I , who wanted to remain quiet!  He mechanically set about making the preparations for departure . Around the world in eighty days!  Was his master a fool ?  No .  Was this a joke , then ?  They were going to Dover; good!  To Calais; good again! After all , Passepartout , who had been away from France five years , would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again .  Perhaps they would go as far as Paris , and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more .  But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there; no doubt--but , then , it was none the less true that he was going away , this so domestic person hitherto!  By eight oclock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag , containing the wardrobes of his master and himself; then , still troubled in mind , he carefully shut the door of his room , and descended to Mr . Fogg .  Mr . Fogg was quite ready .  Under his arm might have been observed a red-bound copy of Bradshaws Continental Railway Steam Transit and General Guide , with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways .  He took the carpet-bag , opened it , and slipped into it a goodly roll of Bank of England notes , which would pass wherever he might go .  You have forgotten nothing ? asked he .  Nothing , monsieur .  My mackintosh and cloak ?  Here they are .  Good!  Take this carpet-bag , handing it to Passepartout .  Take good care of it , for there are twenty thousand pounds in it .  Passepartout nearly dropped the bag , as if the twenty thousand pounds were in gold , and weighed him down .  Master and man then descended , the street-door was double-locked , and at the end of Saville Row they took a cab and drove rapidly to Charing Cross .  The cab stopped before the railway station at twenty minutes past eight .  Passepartout jumped off the box and followed his master , who , after paying the cabman , was about to enter the station , when a poor beggar-woman , with a child in her arms , her naked feet smeared with mud , her head covered with a wretched bonnet , from which hung a tattered feather , and her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl , approached , and mournfully asked for alms .  Mr . Fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist , and handed them to the beggar , saying , Here , my good woman .  Im glad that I met you; and passed on .  Passepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes; his masters action touched his susceptible heart .  Two first-class tickets for Paris having been speedily purchased , Mr . Fogg was crossing the station to the train , when he perceived his five friends of the Reform .  Well , gentlemen , said he , Im off , you see; and , if you will examine my passport when I get back , you will be able to judge whether I have accomplished the journey agreed upon .  Oh , that would be quite unnecessary , Mr . Fogg , said Ralph politely . We will trust your word , as a gentleman of honour .  You do not forget when you are due in London again ?  asked Stuart .  In eighty days; on Saturday , the 21st of December , 1872 , at a quarter before nine p .m .  Good-bye , gentlemen .  Phileas Fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first-class carriage at twenty minutes before nine; five minutes later the whistle screamed , and the train slowly glided out of the station .  The night was dark , and a fine , steady rain was falling .  Phileas Fogg , snugly ensconced in his corner , did not open his lips .  Passepartout , not yet recovered from his stupefaction , clung mechanically to the carpet-bag , with its enormous treasure .  Just as the train was whirling through Sydenham , Passepartout suddenly uttered a cry of despair .  Whats the matter ? asked Mr . Fogg .  Alas!  In my hurry--I--I forgot--  What ?  To turn off the gas in my room!  Very well , young man , returned Mr . Fogg , coolly; it will burn--at your expense .     Chapter V   IN WHICH A NEW SPECIES OF FUNDS , UNKNOWN TO THE MONEYED MEN , APPEARS ON CHANGE   Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London would create a lively sensation at the West End .  The news of the bet spread through the Reform Club , and afforded an exciting topic of conversation to its members .  From the club it soon got into the papers throughout England .  The boasted tour of the world was talked about , disputed , argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama claim .  Some took sides with Phileas Fogg , but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him; it was absurd , impossible , they declared , that the tour of the world could be made , except theoretically and on paper , in this minimum of time , and with the existing means of travelling .  The Times , Standard , Morning Post , and Daily News , and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted Mr . Foggs project as madness; the Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him .  People in general thought him a lunatic , and blamed his Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer .  Articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question , for geography is one of the pet subjects of the English; and the columns devoted to Phileas Foggs venture were eagerly devoured by all classes of readers .  At first some rash individuals , principally of the gentler sex , espoused his cause , which became still more popular when the Illustrated London News came out with his portrait , copied from a photograph in the Reform Club .  A few readers of the Daily Telegraph even dared to say , Why not , after all ?  Stranger things have come to pass .  At last a long article appeared , on the 7th of October , in the bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society , which treated the question from every point of view , and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterprise .  Everything , it said , was against the travellers , every obstacle imposed alike by man and by nature .  A miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival , which was impossible , was absolutely necessary to his success .  He might , perhaps , reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hours , in Europe , where the distances were relatively moderate; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days , and the United States in seven , could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task ?  There were accidents to machinery , the liability of trains to run off the line , collisions , bad weather , the blocking up by snow--were not all these against Phileas Fogg ?  Would he not find himself , when travelling by steamer in winter , at the mercy of the winds and fogs ?  Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be two or three days behind time ?  But a single delay would suffice to fatally break the chain of communication; should Phileas Fogg once miss , even by an hour; a steamer , he would have to wait for the next , and that would irrevocably render his attempt vain .  This article made a great deal of noise , and , being copied into all the papers , seriously depressed the advocates of the rash tourist .  Everybody knows that England is the world of betting men , who are of a higher class than mere gamblers; to bet is in the English temperament . Not only the members of the Reform , but the general public , made heavy wagers for or against Phileas Fogg , who was set down in the betting books as if he were a race-horse .  Bonds were issued , and made their appearance on Change; Phileas Fogg bonds were offered at par or at a premium , and a great business was done in them .  But five days after the article in the bulletin of the Geographical Society appeared , the demand began to subside:  Phileas Fogg declined .  They were offered by packages , at first of five , then of ten , until at last nobody would take less than twenty , fifty , a hundred!  Lord Albemarle , an elderly paralytic gentleman , was now the only advocate of Phileas Fogg left .  This noble lord , who was fastened to his chair , would have given his fortune to be able to make the tour of the world , if it took ten years; and he bet five thousand pounds on Phileas Fogg .  When the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was pointed out to him , he contented himself with replying , If the thing is feasible , the first to do it ought to be an Englishman .  The Fogg party dwindled more and more , everybody was going against him , and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred to one; and a week after his departure an incident occurred which deprived him of backers at any price .  The commissioner of police was sitting in his office at nine oclock one evening , when the following telegraphic dispatch was put into his hands:  Suez to London .  Rowan , Commissioner of Police , Scotland Yard:  Ive found the bank robber , Phileas Fogg .  Send with out delay warrant of arrest to Bombay .  Fix , Detective .  The effect of this dispatch was instantaneous .  The polished gentleman disappeared to give place to the bank robber .  His photograph , which was hung with those of the rest of the members at the Reform Club , was minutely examined , and it betrayed , feature by feature , the description of the robber which had been provided to the police .  The mysterious habits of Phileas Fogg were recalled; his solitary ways , his sudden departure; and it seemed clear that , in undertaking a tour round the world on the pretext of a wager , he had had no other end in view than to elude the detectives , and throw them off his track .     Chapter VI  IN WHICH FIX , THE DETECTIVE , BETRAYS A VERY NATURAL IMPATIENCE   The circumstances under which this telegraphic dispatch about Phileas Fogg was sent were as follows:  The steamer Mongolia , belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company , built of iron , of two thousand eight hundred tons burden , and five hundred horse-power , was due at eleven oclock a .m . on Wednesday , the 9th of October , at Suez .  The Mongolia plied regularly between Brindisi and Bombay via the Suez Canal , and was one of the fastest steamers belonging to the company , always making more than ten knots an hour between Brindisi and Suez , and nine and a half between Suez and Bombay .  Two men were promenading up and down the wharves , among the crowd of natives and strangers who were sojourning at this once straggling village--now , thanks to the enterprise of M . Lesseps , a fast-growing town .  One was the British consul at Suez , who , despite the prophecies of the English Government , and the unfavourable predictions of Stephenson , was in the habit of seeing , from his office window , English ships daily passing to and fro on the great canal , by which the old roundabout route from England to India by the Cape of Good Hope was abridged by at least a half .  The other was a small , slight-built personage , with a nervous , intelligent face , and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows which he was incessantly twitching .  He was just now manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience , nervously pacing up and down , and unable to stand still for a moment .  This was Fix , one of the detectives who had been dispatched from England in search of the bank robber; it was his task to narrowly watch every passenger who arrived at Suez , and to follow up all who seemed to be suspicious characters , or bore a resemblance to the description of the criminal , which he had received two days before from the police headquarters at London .  The detective was evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining the splendid reward which would be the prize of success , and awaited with a feverish impatience , easy to understand , the arrival of the steamer Mongolia .  So you say , consul , asked he for the twentieth time , that this steamer is never behind time ?  No , Mr . Fix , replied the consul .  She was bespoken yesterday at Port Said , and the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft .  I repeat that the Mongolia has been in advance of the time required by the companys regulations , and gained the prize awarded for excess of speed .  Does she come directly from Brindisi ?  Directly from Brindisi; she takes on the Indian mails there , and she left there Saturday at five p .m .  Have patience , Mr . Fix; she will not be late .  But really , I dont see how , from the description you have , you will be able to recognise your man , even if he is on board the Mongolia .  A man rather feels the presence of these fellows , consul , than recognises them .  You must have a scent for them , and a scent is like a sixth sense which combines hearing , seeing , and smelling .  Ive arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time , and , if my thief is on board , Ill answer for it; hell not slip through my fingers .  I hope so , Mr . Fix , for it was a heavy robbery .  A magnificent robbery , consul; fifty-five thousand pounds!  We dont often have such windfalls .  Burglars are getting to be so contemptible nowadays!  A fellow gets hung for a handful of shillings!  Mr . Fix , said the consul , I like your way of talking , and hope youll succeed; but I fear you will find it far from easy .  Dont you see , the description which you have there has a singular resemblance to an honest man ?  Consul , remarked the detective , dogmatically , great robbers always resemble honest folks .  Fellows who have rascally faces have only one course to take , and that is to remain honest; otherwise they would be arrested off-hand .  The artistic thing is , to unmask honest countenances; its no light task , I admit , but a real art .  Mr . Fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit .  Little by little the scene on the quay became more animated; sailors of various nations , merchants , ship-brokers , porters , fellahs , bustled to and fro as if the steamer were immediately expected .  The weather was clear , and slightly chilly .  The minarets of the town loomed above the houses in the pale rays of the sun .  A jetty pier , some two thousand yards along , extended into the roadstead .  A number of fishing-smacks and coasting boats , some retaining the fantastic fashion of ancient galleys , were discernible on the Red Sea .  As he passed among the busy crowd , Fix , according to habit , scrutinised the passers-by with a keen , rapid glance .  It was now half-past ten .  The steamer doesnt come! he exclaimed , as the port clock struck .  She cant be far off now , returned his companion .  How long will she stop at Suez ?  Four hours; long enough to get in her coal .  It is thirteen hundred and ten miles from Suez to Aden , at the other end of the Red Sea , and she has to take in a fresh coal supply .  And does she go from Suez directly to Bombay ?  Without putting in anywhere .  Good! said Fix .  If the robber is on board he will no doubt get off at Suez , so as to reach the Dutch or French colonies in Asia by some other route .  He ought to know that he would not be safe an hour in India , which is English soil .  Unless , objected the consul , he is exceptionally shrewd .  An English criminal , you know , is always better concealed in London than anywhere else .  This observation furnished the detective food for thought , and meanwhile the consul went away to his office .  Fix , left alone , was more impatient than ever , having a presentiment that the robber was on board the Mongolia .  If he had indeed left London intending to reach the New World , he would naturally take the route via India , which was less watched and more difficult to watch than that of the Atlantic . But Fixs reflections were soon interrupted by a succession of sharp whistles , which announced the arrival of the Mongolia .  The porters and fellahs rushed down the quay , and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to go and meet the steamer .  Soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along between the banks , and eleven oclock struck as she anchored in the road .  She brought an unusual number of passengers , some of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the town , while the greater part disembarked in the boats , and landed on the quay .  Fix took up a position , and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance .  Presently one of the passengers , after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters , came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the English consulate , at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed .  Fix instinctively took the passport , and with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer .  An involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped him , for the description in the passport was identical with that of the bank robber which he had received from Scotland Yard .  Is this your passport ? asked he .  No , its my masters .  And your master is--  He stayed on board .  But he must go to the consuls in person , so as to establish his identity .  Oh , is that necessary ?  Quite indispensable .  And where is the consulate ?  There , on the corner of the square , said Fix , pointing to a house two hundred steps off .  Ill go and fetch my master , who wont be much pleased , however , to be disturbed .  The passenger bowed to Fix , and returned to the steamer .     Chapter VII  WHICH ONCE MORE DEMONSTRATES THE USELESSNESS OF PASSPORTS AS AIDS TO DETECTIVES   The detective passed down the quay , and rapidly made his way to the consuls office , where he was at once admitted to the presence of that official .  Consul , said he , without preamble , I have strong reasons for believing that my man is a passenger on the Mongolia . And he narrated what had just passed concerning the passport .  Well , Mr . Fix , replied the consul , I shall not be sorry to see the rascals face; but perhaps he wont come here--that is , if he is the person you suppose him to be .  A robber doesnt quite like to leave traces of his flight behind him; and , besides , he is not obliged to have his passport countersigned .  If he is as shrewd as I think he is , consul , he will come .  To have his passport visaed ?  Yes .  Passports are only good for annoying honest folks , and aiding in the flight of rogues .  I assure you it will be quite the thing for him to do; but I hope you will not visa the passport .  Why not ?  If the passport is genuine I have no right to refuse .  Still , I must keep this man here until I can get a warrant to arrest him from London .  Ah , thats your look-out .  But I cannot--  The consul did not finish his sentence , for as he spoke a knock was heard at the door , and two strangers entered , one of whom was the servant whom Fix had met on the quay .  The other , who was his master , held out his passport with the request that the consul would do him the favour to visa it .  The consul took the document and carefully read it , whilst Fix observed , or rather devoured , the stranger with his eyes from a corner of the room .  You are Mr . Phileas Fogg ? said the consul , after reading the passport .  I am .  And this man is your servant ?  He is: a Frenchman , named Passepartout .  You are from London ?  Yes .  And you are going--  To Bombay .  Very good , sir .  You know that a visa is useless , and that no passport is required ?  I know it , sir , replied Phileas Fogg; but I wish to prove , by your visa , that I came by Suez .  Very well , sir .  The consul proceeded to sign and date the passport , after which he added his official seal .  Mr . Fogg paid the customary fee , coldly bowed , and went out , followed by his servant .  Well ? queried the detective .  Well , he looks and acts like a perfectly honest man , replied the consul .  Possibly; but that is not the question .  Do you think , consul , that this phlegmatic gentleman resembles , feature by feature , the robber whose description I have received ?  I concede that; but then , you know , all descriptions--  Ill make certain of it , interrupted Fix .  The servant seems to me less mysterious than the master; besides , hes a Frenchman , and cant help talking .  Excuse me for a little while , consul .  Fix started off in search of Passepartout .  Meanwhile Mr . Fogg , after leaving the consulate , repaired to the quay , gave some orders to Passepartout , went off to the    Mongolia in a boat , and descended to his cabin .  He took up his note-book , which contained the following memoranda:  Left London , Wednesday , October 2nd , at 8 .45 p .m .  Reached Paris , Thursday , October 3rd , at 7 .20 a .m .  Left Paris , Thursday , at 8 .40 a .m .  Reached Turin by Mont Cenis , Friday , October 4th , at 6 .35 a .m . Left Turin , Friday , at 7 .20 a .m .  Arrived at Brindisi , Saturday , October 5th , at 4 p .m .  Sailed on the Mongolia , Saturday , at 5 p .m . Reached Suez , Wednesday , October 9th , at 11 a .m .  Total of hours spent , 158+; or , in days , six days and a half .  These dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns , indicating the month , the day of the month , and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point Paris , Brindisi , Suez , Bombay , Calcutta , Singapore , Hong Kong , Yokohama , San Francisco , New York , and London--from the 2nd of October to the 21st of December; and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality .  This methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed , and Mr . Fogg always knew whether he was behind-hand or in advance of his time .  On this Friday , October 9th , he noted his arrival at Suez , and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost .  He sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin , never once thinking of inspecting the town , being one of those Englishmen who are wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics .     Chapter VIII  IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT TALKS RATHER MORE , PERHAPS , THAN IS PRUDENT   Fix soon rejoined Passepartout , who was lounging and looking about on the quay , as if he did not feel that he , at least , was obliged not to see anything .  Well , my friend , said the detective , coming up with him , is your passport visaed ?  Ah , its you , is it , monsieur ? responded Passepartout .  Thanks , yes , the passport is all right .  And you are looking about you ?  Yes; but we travel so fast that I seem to be journeying in a dream . So this is Suez ?  Yes .  In Egypt ?  Certainly , in Egypt .  And in Africa ?  In Africa .  In Africa! repeated Passepartout .  Just think , monsieur , I had no idea that we should go farther than Paris; and all that I saw of Paris was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in the morning , between the Northern and the Lyons stations , through the windows of a car , and in a driving rain!  How I regret not having seen once more Pere la Chaise and the circus in the Champs Elysees!  You are in a great hurry , then ?  I am not , but my master is .  By the way , I must buy some shoes and shirts .  We came away without trunks , only with a carpet-bag .  I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want .  Really , monsieur , you are very kind .  And they walked off together , Passepartout chatting volubly as they went along .  Above all , said he; dont let me lose the steamer .  You have plenty of time; its only twelve oclock .  Passepartout pulled out his big watch .  Twelve! he exclaimed; why , its only eight minutes before ten .  Your watch is slow .  My watch ?  A family watch , monsieur , which has come down from my great-grandfather!  It doesnt vary five minutes in the year .  Its a perfect chronometer , look you .  I see how it is , said Fix .  You have kept London time , which is two hours behind that of Suez .  You ought to regulate your watch at noon in each country .  I regulate my watch ?  Never!  Well , then , it will not agree with the sun .  So much the worse for the sun , monsieur .  The sun will be wrong , then!  And the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant gesture .  After a few minutes silence , Fix resumed: You left London hastily , then ?  I rather think so!  Last Friday at eight oclock in the evening , Monsieur Fogg came home from his club , and three-quarters of an hour afterwards we were off .  But where is your master going ?  Always straight ahead .  He is going round the world .  Round the world ? cried Fix .  Yes , and in eighty days!  He says it is on a wager; but , between us , I dont believe a word of it .  That wouldnt be common sense .  Theres something else in the wind .  Ah!  Mr . Fogg is a character , is he ?  I should say he was .  Is he rich ?  No doubt , for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes with him .  And he doesnt spare the money on the way , either: he has offered a large reward to the engineer of the Mongolia if he gets us to Bombay well in advance of time .  And you have known your master a long time ?  Why , no; I entered his service the very day we left London .  The effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined .  The hasty departure from London soon after the robbery; the large sum carried by Mr . Fogg; his eagerness to reach distant countries; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet--all confirmed Fix in his theory .  He continued to pump poor Passepartout , and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master , who lived a solitary existence in London , was said to be rich , though no one knew whence came his riches , and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits .  Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not land at Suez , but was really going on to Bombay .  Is Bombay far from here ? asked Passepartout .  Pretty far .  It is a ten days voyage by sea .  And in what country is Bombay ?  India .  In Asia ?  Certainly .  The deuce!  I was going to tell you theres one thing that worries me--my burner!  What burner ?  My gas-burner , which I forgot to turn off , and which is at this moment burning at my expense .  I have calculated , monsieur , that I lose two shillings every four and twenty hours , exactly sixpence more than I earn; and you will understand that the longer our journey--  Did Fix pay any attention to Passepartouts trouble about the gas ?  It is not probable .  He was not listening , but was cogitating a project . Passepartout and he had now reached the shop , where Fix left his companion to make his purchases , after recommending him not to miss the steamer , and hurried back to the consulate .  Now that he was fully convinced , Fix had quite recovered his equanimity .  Consul , said he , I have no longer any doubt .  I have spotted my man . He passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the world in eighty days .  Then hes a sharp fellow , returned the consul , and counts on returning to London after putting the police of the two countries off his track .  Well see about that , replied Fix .  But are you not mistaken ?  I am not mistaken .  Why was this robber so anxious to prove , by the visa , that he had passed through Suez ?  Why ?  I have no idea; but listen to me .  He reported in a few words the most important parts of his conversation with Passepartout .  In short , said the consul , appearances are wholly against this man . And what are you going to do ?  Send a dispatch to London for a warrant of arrest to be dispatched instantly to Bombay , take passage on board the Mongolia , follow my rogue to India , and there , on English ground , arrest him politely , with my warrant in my hand , and my hand on his shoulder .  Having uttered these words with a cool , careless air , the detective took leave of the consul , and repaired to the telegraph office , whence he sent the dispatch which we have seen to the London police office .  A quarter of an hour later found Fix , with a small bag in his hand , proceeding on board the Mongolia; and , ere many moments longer , the noble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the Red Sea .     Chapter IX  IN WHICH THE RED SEA AND THE INDIAN OCEAN PROVE PROPITIOUS TO THE DESIGNS OF PHILEAS FOGG   The distance between Suez and Aden is precisely thirteen hundred and ten miles , and the regulations of the company allow the steamers one hundred and thirty-eight hours in which to traverse it .  The Mongolia , thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer , seemed likely , so rapid was her speed , to reach her destination considerably within that time .  The greater part of the passengers from Brindisi were bound for India some for Bombay , others for Calcutta by way of Bombay , the nearest route thither , now that a railway crosses the Indian peninsula . Among the passengers was a number of officials and military officers of various grades , the latter being either attached to the regular British forces or commanding the Sepoy troops , and receiving high salaries ever since the central government has assumed the powers of the East India Company: for the sub-lieutenants get 280 pounds , brigadiers , 2 ,400 pounds , and generals of divisions , 4 ,000 pounds .  What with the military men , a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels , and the hospitable efforts of the purser , the time passed quickly on the Mongolia .  The best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast , lunch , dinner , and the eight oclock supper , and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day; and the hours were whirled away , when the sea was tranquil , with music , dancing , and games .  But the Red Sea is full of caprice , and often boisterous , like most long and narrow gulfs .  When the wind came from the African or Asian coast the Mongolia , with her long hull , rolled fearfully .  Then the ladies speedily disappeared below; the pianos were silent; singing and dancing suddenly ceased .  Yet the good ship ploughed straight on , unretarded by wind or wave , towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb .  What was Phileas Fogg doing all this time ?  It might be thought that , in his anxiety , he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind , the disorderly raging of the billows--every chance , in short , which might force the Mongolia to slacken her speed , and thus interrupt his journey .  But , if he thought of these possibilities , he did not betray the fact by any outward sign .  Always the same impassible member of the Reform Club , whom no incident could surprise , as unvarying as the ships chronometers , and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck , he passed through the memorable scenes of the Red Sea with cold indifference; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which , along its borders , raised their picturesque outlines against the sky; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the Arabic Gulf , which the old historians always spoke of with horror , and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices .  How did this eccentric personage pass his time on the Mongolia ?  He made his four hearty meals every day , regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer; and he played whist indefatigably , for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself .  A tax-collector , on the way to his post at Goa; the Rev . Decimus Smith , returning to his parish at Bombay; and a brigadier-general of the English army , who was about to rejoin his brigade at Benares , made up the party , and , with Mr . Fogg , played whist by the hour together in absorbing silence .  As for Passepartout , he , too , had escaped sea-sickness , and took his meals conscientiously in the forward cabin .  He rather enjoyed the voyage , for he was well fed and well lodged , took a great interest in the scenes through which they were passing , and consoled himself with the delusion that his masters whim would end at Bombay .  He was pleased , on the day after leaving Suez , to find on deck the obliging person with whom he had walked and chatted on the quays .  If I am not mistaken , said he , approaching this person , with his most amiable smile , you are the gentleman who so kindly volunteered to guide me at Suez ?  Ah!  I quite recognise you .  You are the servant of the strange Englishman--  Just so , monsieur--  Fix .  Monsieur Fix , resumed Passepartout , Im charmed to find you on board .  Where are you bound ?  Like you , to Bombay .  Thats capital!  Have you made this trip before ?  Several times .  I am one of the agents of the Peninsular Company .  Then you know India ?  Why yes , replied Fix , who spoke cautiously .  A curious place , this India ?  Oh , very curious .  Mosques , minarets , temples , fakirs , pagodas , tigers , snakes , elephants!  I hope you will have ample time to see the sights .  I hope so , Monsieur Fix .  You see , a man of sound sense ought not to spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway train , and from a railway train upon a steamer again , pretending to make the tour of the world in eighty days!  No; all these gymnastics , you may be sure , will cease at Bombay .  And Mr . Fogg is getting on well ? asked Fix , in the most natural tone in the world .  Quite well , and I too .  I eat like a famished ogre; its the sea air .  But I never see your master on deck .  Never; he hasnt the least curiosity .  Do you know , Mr . Passepartout , that this pretended tour in eighty days may conceal some secret errand--perhaps a diplomatic mission ?  Faith , Monsieur Fix , I assure you I know nothing about it , nor would I give half a crown to find out .  After this meeting , Passepartout and Fix got into the habit of chatting together , the latter making it a point to gain the worthy mans confidence .  He frequently offered him a glass of whiskey or pale ale in the steamer bar-room , which Passepartout never failed to accept with graceful alacrity , mentally pronouncing Fix the best of good fellows .  Meanwhile the Mongolia was pushing forward rapidly; on the 13th , Mocha , surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees were growing , was sighted , and on the mountains beyond were espied vast coffee-fields . Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place , and thought that , with its circular walls and dismantled fort , it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer . The following night they passed through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb , which means in Arabic The Bridge of Tears , and the next day they put in at Steamer Point , north-west of Aden harbour , to take in coal .  This matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances from the coal-mines; it costs the Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year .  In these distant seas , coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton .  The Mongolia had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching Bombay , and was obliged to remain four hours at Steamer Point to coal up .  But this delay , as it was foreseen , did not affect Phileas Foggs programme; besides , the Mongolia , instead of reaching Aden on the morning of the 15th , when she was due , arrived there on the evening of the 14th , a gain of fifteen hours .  Mr . Fogg and his servant went ashore at Aden to have the passport again visaed; Fix , unobserved , followed them .  The visa procured , Mr . Fogg returned on board to resume his former habits; while Passepartout , according to custom , sauntered about among the mixed population of Somalis , Banyans , Parsees , Jews , Arabs , and Europeans who comprise the twenty-five thousand inhabitants of Aden .  He gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place the Gibraltar of the Indian Ocean , and the vast cisterns where the English engineers were still at work , two thousand years after the engineers of Solomon .  Very curious , very curious , said Passepartout to himself , on returning to the steamer .  I see that it is by no means useless to travel , if a man wants to see something new .  At six p .m .  the Mongolia slowly moved out of the roadstead , and was soon once more on the Indian Ocean .  She had a hundred and sixty-eight hours in which to reach Bombay , and the sea was favourable , the wind being in the north-west , and all sails aiding the engine .  The steamer rolled but little , the ladies , in fresh toilets , reappeared on deck , and the singing and dancing were resumed .  The trip was being accomplished most successfully , and Passepartout was enchanted with the congenial companion which chance had secured him in the person of the delightful Fix .  On Sunday , October 20th , towards noon , they came in sight of the Indian coast: two hours later the pilot came on board .  A range of hills lay against the sky in the horizon , and soon the rows of palms which adorn Bombay came distinctly into view .  The steamer entered the road formed by the islands in the bay , and at half-past four she hauled up at the quays of Bombay .  Phileas Fogg was in the act of finishing the thirty-third rubber of the voyage , and his partner and himself having , by a bold stroke , captured all thirteen of the tricks , concluded this fine campaign with a brilliant victory .  The Mongolia was due at Bombay on the 22nd; she arrived on the 20th . This was a gain to Phileas Fogg of two days since his departure from London , and he calmly entered the fact in the itinerary , in the column of gains .     Chapter X  IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT IS ONLY TOO GLAD TO GET OFF WITH THE LOSS OF HIS SHOES   Everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land , with its base in the north and its apex in the south , which is called India , embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles , upon which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls .  The British Crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of this vast country , and has a governor-general stationed at Calcutta , governors at Madras , Bombay , and in Bengal , and a lieutenant-governor at Agra .  But British India , properly so called , only embraces seven hundred thousand square miles , and a population of from one hundred to one hundred and ten millions of inhabitants .  A considerable portion of India is still free from British authority; and there are certain ferocious rajahs in the interior who are absolutely independent .  The celebrated East India Company was all-powerful from 1756 , when the English first gained a foothold on the spot where now stands the city of Madras , down to the time of the great Sepoy insurrection .  It gradually annexed province after province , purchasing them of the native chiefs , whom it seldom paid , and appointed the governor-general and his subordinates , civil and military .  But the East India Company has now passed away , leaving the British possessions in India directly under the control of the Crown .  The aspect of the country , as well as the manners and distinctions of race , is daily changing .  Formerly one was obliged to travel in India by the old cumbrous methods of going on foot or on horseback , in palanquins or unwieldy coaches; now fast steamboats ply on the Indus and the Ganges , and a great railway , with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its route , traverses the peninsula from Bombay to Calcutta in three days . This railway does not run in a direct line across India .  The distance between Bombay and Calcutta , as the bird flies , is only from one thousand to eleven hundred miles; but the deflections of the road increase this distance by more than a third .  The general route of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway is as follows: Leaving Bombay , it passes through Salcette , crossing to the continent opposite Tannah , goes over the chain of the Western Ghauts , runs thence north-east as far as Burhampoor , skirts the nearly independent territory of Bundelcund , ascends to Allahabad , turns thence eastwardly , meeting the Ganges at Benares , then departs from the river a little , and , descending south-eastward by Burdivan and the French town of Chandernagor , has its terminus at Calcutta .  The passengers of the Mongolia went ashore at half-past four p .m .; at exactly eight the train would start for Calcutta .  Mr . Fogg , after bidding good-bye to his whist partners , left the steamer , gave his servant several errands to do , urged it upon him to be at the station promptly at eight , and , with his regular step , which beat to the second , like an astronomical clock , directed his steps to the passport office .  As for the wonders of Bombay--its famous city hall , its splendid library , its forts and docks , its bazaars , mosques , synagogues , its Armenian churches , and the noble pagoda on Malabar Hill , with its two polygonal towers--he cared not a straw to see them . He would not deign to examine even the masterpieces of Elephanta , or the mysterious hypogea , concealed south-east from the docks , or those fine remains of Buddhist architecture , the Kanherian grottoes of the island of Salcette .  Having transacted his business at the passport office , Phileas Fogg repaired quietly to the railway station , where he ordered dinner . Among the dishes served up to him , the landlord especially recommended a certain giblet of native rabbit , on which he prided himself .  Mr . Fogg accordingly tasted the dish , but , despite its spiced sauce , found it far from palatable .  He rang for the landlord , and , on his appearance , said , fixing his clear eyes upon him , Is this rabbit , sir ?  Yes , my lord , the rogue boldly replied , rabbit from the jungles .  And this rabbit did not mew when he was killed ?  Mew , my lord!  What , a rabbit mew!  I swear to you--  Be so good , landlord , as not to swear , but remember this: cats were formerly considered , in India , as sacred animals .  That was a good time .  For the cats , my lord ?  Perhaps for the travellers as well!  After which Mr . Fogg quietly continued his dinner .  Fix had gone on shore shortly after Mr . Fogg , and his first destination was the headquarters of the Bombay police .  He made himself known as a London detective , told his business at Bombay , and the position of affairs relative to the supposed robber , and nervously asked if a warrant had arrived from London .  It had not reached the office; indeed , there had not yet been time for it to arrive .  Fix was sorely disappointed , and tried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the Bombay police .  This the director refused , as the matter concerned the London office , which alone could legally deliver the warrant .  Fix did not insist , and was fain to resign himself to await the arrival of the important document; but he was determined not to lose sight of the mysterious rogue as long as he stayed in Bombay .  He did not doubt for a moment , any more than Passepartout , that Phileas Fogg would remain there , at least until it was time for the warrant to arrive .  Passepartout , however , had no sooner heard his masters orders on leaving the Mongolia than he saw at once that they were to leave Bombay as they had done Suez and Paris , and that the journey would be extended at least as far as Calcutta , and perhaps beyond that place .  He began to ask himself if this bet that Mr . Fogg talked about was not really in good earnest , and whether his fate was not in truth forcing him , despite his love of repose , around the world in eighty days!  Having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes , he took a leisurely promenade about the streets , where crowds of people of many nationalities--Europeans , Persians with pointed caps , Banyas with round turbans , Sindes with square bonnets , Parsees with black mitres , and long-robed Armenians--were collected .  It happened to be the day of a Parsee festival .  These descendants of the sect of Zoroaster--the most thrifty , civilised , intelligent , and austere of the East Indians , among whom are counted the richest native merchants of Bombay--were celebrating a sort of religious carnival , with processions and shows , in the midst of which Indian dancing-girls , clothed in rose-coloured gauze , looped up with gold and silver , danced airily , but with perfect modesty , to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines .  It is needless to say that Passepartout watched these curious ceremonies with staring eyes and gaping mouth , and that his countenance was that of the greenest booby imaginable .  Unhappily for his master , as well as himself , his curiosity drew him unconsciously farther off than he intended to go .  At last , having seen the Parsee carnival wind away in the distance , he was turning his steps towards the station , when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on Malabar Hill , and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its interior .  He was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to Christians to enter certain Indian temples , and that even the faithful must not go in without first leaving their shoes outside the door .  It may be said here that the wise policy of the British Government severely punishes a disregard of the practices of the native religions .  Passepartout , however , thinking no harm , went in like a simple tourist , and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin ornamentation which everywhere met his eyes , when of a sudden he found himself sprawling on the sacred flagging .  He looked up to behold three enraged priests , who forthwith fell upon him; tore off his shoes , and began to beat him with loud , savage exclamations .  The agile Frenchman was soon upon his feet again , and lost no time in knocking down two of his long-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of his toes; then , rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could carry him , he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd in the streets .  At five minutes before eight , Passepartout , hatless , shoeless , and having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes , rushed breathlessly into the station .  Fix , who had followed Mr . Fogg to the station , and saw that he was really going to leave Bombay , was there , upon the platform .  He had resolved to follow the supposed robber to Calcutta , and farther , if necessary .  Passepartout did not observe the detective , who stood in an obscure corner; but Fix heard him relate his adventures in a few words to Mr . Fogg .  I hope that this will not happen again , said Phileas Fogg coldly , as he got into the train .  Poor Passepartout , quite crestfallen , followed his master without a word .  Fix was on the point of entering another carriage , when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan .  No , Ill stay , muttered he .  An offence has been committed on Indian soil .  Ive got my man .  Just then the locomotive gave a sharp screech , and the train passed out into the darkness of the night .     Chapter XI  IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SECURES A CURIOUS MEANS OF CONVEYANCE AT A FABULOUS PRICE   The train had started punctually .  Among the passengers were a number of officers , Government officials , and opium and indigo merchants , whose business called them to the eastern coast .  Passepartout rode in the same carriage with his master , and a third passenger occupied a seat opposite to them .  This was Sir Francis Cromarty , one of Mr . Foggs whist partners on the Mongolia , now on his way to join his corps at Benares .  Sir Francis was a tall , fair man of fifty , who had greatly distinguished himself in the last Sepoy revolt .  He made India his home , only paying brief visits to England at rare intervals; and was almost as familiar as a native with the customs , history , and character of India and its people .  But Phileas Fogg , who was not travelling , but only describing a circumference , took no pains to inquire into these subjects; he was a solid body , traversing an orbit around the terrestrial globe , according to the laws of rational mechanics .  He was at this moment calculating in his mind the number of hours spent since his departure from London , and , had it been in his nature to make a useless demonstration , would have rubbed his hands for satisfaction . Sir Francis Cromarty had observed the oddity of his travelling companion--although the only opportunity he had for studying him had been while he was dealing the cards , and between two rubbers--and questioned himself whether a human heart really beat beneath this cold exterior , and whether Phileas Fogg had any sense of the beauties of nature .  The brigadier-general was free to mentally confess that , of all the eccentric persons he had ever met , none was comparable to this product of the exact sciences .  Phileas Fogg had not concealed from Sir Francis his design of going round the world , nor the circumstances under which he set out; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of sound common sense .  In the way this strange gentleman was going on , he would leave the world without having done any good to himself or anybody else .  An hour after leaving Bombay the train had passed the viaducts and the Island of Salcette , and had got into the open country .  At Callyan they reached the junction of the branch line which descends towards south-eastern India by Kandallah and Pounah; and , passing Pauwell , they entered the defiles of the mountains , with their basalt bases , and their summits crowned with thick and verdant forests .  Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty exchanged a few words from time to time , and now Sir Francis , reviving the conversation , observed , Some years ago , Mr . Fogg , you would have met with a delay at this point which would probably have lost you your wager .  How so , Sir Francis ?  Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains , which the passengers were obliged to cross in palanquins or on ponies to Kandallah , on the other side .  Such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the least , said Mr . Fogg .  I have constantly foreseen the likelihood of certain obstacles .  But , Mr . Fogg , pursued Sir Francis , you run the risk of having some difficulty about this worthy fellows adventure at the pagoda . Passepartout , his feet comfortably wrapped in his travelling-blanket , was sound asleep and did not dream that anybody was talking about him . The Government is very severe upon that kind of offence .  It takes particular care that the religious customs of the Indians should be respected , and if your servant were caught--  Very well , Sir Francis , replied Mr . Fogg; if he had been caught he would have been condemned and punished , and then would have quietly returned to Europe .  I dont see how this affair could have delayed his master .  The conversation fell again .  During the night the train left the mountains behind , and passed Nassik , and the next day proceeded over the flat , well-cultivated country of the Khandeish , with its straggling villages , above which rose the minarets of the pagodas .  This fertile territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams , mostly tributaries of the Godavery .  Passepartout , on waking and looking out , could not realise that he was actually crossing India in a railway train .  The locomotive , guided by an English engineer and fed with English coal , threw out its smoke upon cotton , coffee , nutmeg , clove , and pepper plantations , while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees , in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows , viharis (sort of abandoned monasteries) , and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of Indian architecture .  Then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon , with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers , which fled at the noise of the train; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway , and still haunted by elephants which , with pensive eyes , gazed at the train as it passed .  The travellers crossed , beyond Milligaum , the fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the goddess Kali .  Not far off rose Ellora , with its graceful pagodas , and the famous Aurungabad , capital of the ferocious Aureng-Zeb , now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the kingdom of the Nizam .  It was thereabouts that Feringhea , the Thuggee chief , king of the stranglers , held his sway .  These ruffians , united by a secret bond , strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess Death , without ever shedding blood; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction .  The English Government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders , though the Thuggees still exist , and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites .  At half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where Passepartout was able to purchase some Indian slippers , ornamented with false pearls , in which , with evident vanity , he proceeded to encase his feet . The travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off for Assurghur , after skirting for a little the banks of the small river Tapty , which empties into the Gulf of Cambray , near Surat .  Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie .  Up to his arrival at Bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there; but , now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams .  His old vagabond nature returned to him; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him .  He came to regard his masters project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period .  Already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way .  He recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before .  Being much less cool-headed than Mr . Fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming Mr . Fogg for not having bribed the engineer .  The worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway .  The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains , which separate the Khandeish from Bundelcund , towards evening .  The next day Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was; to which , on consulting his watch , he replied that it was three in the morning . This famous timepiece , always regulated on the Greenwich meridian , which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward , was at least four hours slow .  Sir Francis corrected Passepartouts time , whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to Fix; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian , since he was constantly going eastward , that is in the face of the sun , and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over , Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch , which he kept at London time .  It was an innocent delusion which could harm no one .  The train stopped , at eight oclock , in the midst of a glade some fifteen miles beyond Rothal , where there were several bungalows , and workmens cabins .  The conductor , passing along the carriages , shouted , Passengers will get out here!  Phileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation; but the general could not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of dates and acacias .  Passepartout , not less surprised , rushed out and speedily returned , crying: Monsieur , no more railway!  What do you mean ? asked Sir Francis .  I mean to say that the train isnt going on .  The general at once stepped out , while Phileas Fogg calmly followed him , and they proceeded together to the conductor .  Where are we ? asked Sir Francis .  At the hamlet of Kholby .  Do we stop here ?  Certainly .  The railway isnt finished .  What! not finished ?  No .  Theres still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here to Allahabad , where the line begins again .  But the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout .  What would you have , officer ?  The papers were mistaken .  Yet you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta , retorted Sir Francis , who was growing warm .  No doubt , replied the conductor; but the passengers know that they must provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to Allahabad .  Sir Francis was furious .  Passepartout would willingly have knocked the conductor down , and did not dare to look at his master .  Sir Francis , said Mr . Fogg quietly , we will , if you please , look about for some means of conveyance to Allahabad .  Mr . Fogg , this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage .  No , Sir Francis; it was foreseen .  What!  You knew that the way--  Not at all; but I knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or later arise on my route .  Nothing , therefore , is lost . I have two days , which I have already gained , to sacrifice .  A steamer leaves Calcutta for Hong Kong at noon , on the 25th .  This is the 22nd , and we shall reach Calcutta in time .  There was nothing to say to so confident a response .  It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point .  The papers were like some watches , which have a way of getting too fast , and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line .  The greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption , and , leaving the train , they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis , waggons drawn by zebus , carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas , palanquins , ponies , and what not .  Mr . Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty , after searching the village from end to end , came back without having found anything .  I shall go afoot , said Phileas Fogg .  Passepartout , who had now rejoined his master , made a wry grimace , as he thought of his magnificent , but too frail Indian shoes .  Happily he too had been looking about him , and , after a moments hesitation , said , Monsieur , I think I have found a means of conveyance .  What ?  An elephant!  An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a hundred steps from here .  Lets go and see the elephant , replied Mr . Fogg .  They soon reached a small hut , near which , enclosed within some high palings , was the animal in question .  An Indian came out of the hut , and , at their request , conducted them within the enclosure .  The elephant , which its owner had reared , not for a beast of burden , but for warlike purposes , was half domesticated .  The Indian had begun already , by often irritating him , and feeding him every three months on sugar and butter , to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature , this method being often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for battle .  Happily , however , for Mr . Fogg , the animals instruction in this direction had not gone far , and the elephant still preserved his natural gentleness .  Kiouni--this was the name of the beast--could doubtless travel rapidly for a long time , and , in default of any other means of conveyance , Mr . Fogg resolved to hire him .  But elephants are far from cheap in India , where they are becoming scarce , the males , which alone are suitable for circus shows , are much sought , especially as but few of them are domesticated .  When therefore Mr . Fogg proposed to the Indian to hire Kiouni , he refused point-blank .  Mr . Fogg persisted , offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to Allahabad .  Refused .  Twenty pounds ?  Refused also .  Forty pounds ?  Still refused .  Passepartout jumped at each advance; but the Indian declined to be tempted .  Yet the offer was an alluring one , for , supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to reach Allahabad , his owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling .  Phileas Fogg , without getting in the least flurried , then proposed to purchase the animal outright , and at first offered a thousand pounds for him .  The Indian , perhaps thinking he was going to make a great bargain , still refused .  Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr . Fogg aside , and begged him to reflect before he went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly , that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake , that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him , and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value . Returning to the Indian , whose small , sharp eyes , glistening with avarice , betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain .  Mr . Fogg offered first twelve hundred , then fifteen hundred , eighteen hundred , two thousand pounds .  Passepartout , usually so rubicund , was fairly white with suspense .  At two thousand pounds the Indian yielded .  What a price , good heavens! cried Passepartout , for an elephant .  It only remained now to find a guide , which was comparatively easy .  A young Parsee , with an intelligent face , offered his services , which Mr . Fogg accepted , promising so generous a reward as to materially stimulate his zeal .  The elephant was led out and equipped .  The Parsee , who was an accomplished elephant driver , covered his back with a sort of saddle-cloth , and attached to each of his flanks some curiously uncomfortable howdahs .  Phileas Fogg paid the Indian with some banknotes which he extracted from the famous carpet-bag , a proceeding that seemed to deprive poor Passepartout of his vitals . Then he offered to carry Sir Francis to Allahabad , which the brigadier gratefully accepted , as one traveller the more would not be likely to fatigue the gigantic beast .  Provisions were purchased at Kholby , and , while Sir Francis and Mr . Fogg took the howdahs on either side , Passepartout got astride the saddle-cloth between them .  The Parsee perched himself on the elephants neck , and at nine oclock they set out from the village , the animal marching off through the dense forest of palms by the shortest cut .     Chapter XII  IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND HIS COMPANIONS VENTURE ACROSS THE INDIAN FORESTS , AND WHAT ENSUED   In order to shorten the journey , the guide passed to the left of the line where the railway was still in process of being built .  This line , owing to the capricious turnings of the Vindhia Mountains , did not pursue a straight course .  The Parsee , who was quite familiar with the roads and paths in the district , declared that they would gain twenty miles by striking directly through the forest .  Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty , plunged to the neck in the peculiar howdahs provided for them , were horribly jostled by the swift trotting of the elephant , spurred on as he was by the skilful Parsee; but they endured the discomfort with true British phlegm , talking little , and scarcely able to catch a glimpse of each other .  As for Passepartout , who was mounted on the beasts back , and received the direct force of each concussion as he trod along , he was very careful , in accordance with his masters advice , to keep his tongue from between his teeth , as it would otherwise have been bitten off short .  The worthy fellow bounced from the elephants neck to his rump , and vaulted like a clown on a spring-board; yet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing , and from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his pocket , and inserted it in Kiounis trunk , who received it without in the least slackening his regular trot .  After two hours the guide stopped the elephant , and gave him an hour for rest , during which Kiouni , after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring , set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about him .  Neither Sir Francis nor Mr . Fogg regretted the delay , and both descended with a feeling of relief .  Why , hes made of iron! exclaimed the general , gazing admiringly on Kiouni .  Of forged iron , replied Passepartout , as he set about preparing a hasty breakfast .  At noon the Parsee gave the signal of departure .  The country soon presented a very savage aspect .  Copses of dates and dwarf-palms succeeded the dense forests; then vast , dry plains , dotted with scanty shrubs , and sown with great blocks of syenite .  All this portion of Bundelcund , which is little frequented by travellers , is inhabited by a fanatical population , hardened in the most horrible practices of the Hindoo faith .  The English have not been able to secure complete dominion over this territory , which is subjected to the influence of rajahs , whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible mountain fastnesses . The travellers several times saw bands of ferocious Indians , who , when they perceived the elephant striding across-country , made angry and threatening motions .  The Parsee avoided them as much as possible .  Few animals were observed on the route; even the monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces which convulsed Passepartout with laughter .  In the midst of his gaiety , however , one thought troubled the worthy servant .  What would Mr . Fogg do with the elephant when he got to Allahabad ?  Would he carry him on with him ?  Impossible!  The cost of transporting him would make him ruinously expensive .  Would he sell him , or set him free ?  The estimable beast certainly deserved some consideration .  Should Mr . Fogg choose to make him , Passepartout , a present of Kiouni , he would be very much embarrassed; and these thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time .  The principal chain of the Vindhias was crossed by eight in the evening , and another halt was made on the northern slope , in a ruined bungalow .  They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day , and an equal distance still separated them from the station of Allahabad .  The night was cold .  The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few dry branches , and the warmth was very grateful , provisions purchased at Kholby sufficed for supper , and the travellers ate ravenously .  The conversation , beginning with a few disconnected phrases , soon gave place to loud and steady snores .  The guide watched Kiouni , who slept standing , bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree . Nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers , although occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow .  Sir Francis slept heavily , like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue .  Passepartout was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before .  As for Mr . Fogg , he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansion in Saville Row .  The journey was resumed at six in the morning; the guide hoped to reach Allahabad by evening .  In that case , Mr . Fogg would only lose a part of the forty-eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour .  Kiouni , resuming his rapid gait , soon descended the lower spurs of the Vindhias , and towards noon they passed by the village of Kallenger , on the Cani , one of the branches of the Ganges .  The guide avoided inhabited places , thinking it safer to keep the open country , which lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river . Allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north-east .  They stopped under a clump of bananas , the fruit of which , as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream , was amply partaken of and appreciated .  At two oclock the guide entered a thick forest which extended several miles; he preferred to travel under cover of the woods .  They had not as yet had any unpleasant encounters , and the journey seemed on the point of being successfully accomplished , when the elephant , becoming restless , suddenly stopped .  It was then four oclock .  Whats the matter ? asked Sir Francis , putting out his head .  I dont know , officer , replied the Parsee , listening attentively to a confused murmur which came through the thick branches .  The murmur soon became more distinct; it now seemed like a distant concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments .  Passepartout was all eyes and ears .  Mr . Fogg patiently waited without a word .  The Parsee jumped to the ground , fastened the elephant to a tree , and plunged into the thicket .  He soon returned , saying:  A procession of Brahmins is coming this way .  We must prevent their seeing us , if possible .  The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket , at the same time asking the travellers not to stir .  He held himself ready to bestride the animal at a moments notice , should flight become necessary; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage , in which they were wholly concealed .  The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer , and now droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbals . The head of the procession soon appeared beneath the trees , a hundred paces away; and the strange figures who performed the religious ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches .  First came the priests , with mitres on their heads , and clothed in long lace robes .  They were surrounded by men , women , and children , who sang a kind of lugubrious psalm , interrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines and cymbals; while behind them was drawn a car with large wheels , the spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each other .  Upon the car , which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus , stood a hideous statue with four arms , the body coloured a dull red , with haggard eyes , dishevelled hair , protruding tongue , and lips tinted with betel .  It stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and headless giant .  Sir Francis , recognising the statue , whispered , The goddess Kali; the goddess of love and death .  Of death , perhaps , muttered back Passepartout , but of love--that ugly old hag ?  Never!  The Parsee made a motion to keep silence .  A group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue; these were striped with ochre , and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop--stupid fanatics , who , in the great Indian ceremonies , still throw themselves under the wheels of Juggernaut .  Some Brahmins , clad in all the sumptuousness of Oriental apparel , and leading a woman who faltered at every step , followed . This woman was young , and as fair as a European .  Her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form .  The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to her , armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists , and long damascened pistols , and bearing a corpse on a palanquin .  It was the body of an old man , gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a rajah , wearing , as in life , a turban embroidered with pearls , a robe of tissue of silk and gold , a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds , and the magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince .  Next came the musicians and a rearguard of capering fakirs , whose cries sometimes drowned the noise of the instruments; these closed the procession .  Sir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance , and , turning to the guide , said , A suttee .  The Parsee nodded , and put his finger to his lips .  The procession slowly wound under the trees , and soon its last ranks disappeared in the depths of the wood .  The songs gradually died away; occasionally cries were heard in the distance , until at last all was silence again .  Phileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said , and , as soon as the procession had disappeared , asked: What is a suttee ?  A suttee , returned the general , is a human sacrifice , but a voluntary one .  The woman you have just seen will be burned to-morrow at the dawn of day .  Oh , the scoundrels! cried Passepartout , who could not repress his indignation .  And the corpse ? asked Mr . Fogg .  Is that of the prince , her husband , said the guide; an independent rajah of Bundelcund .  Is it possible , resumed Phileas Fogg , his voice betraying not the least emotion , that these barbarous customs still exist in India , and that the English have been unable to put a stop to them ?  These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of India , replied Sir Francis; but we have no power over these savage territories , and especially here in Bundelcund .  The whole district north of the Vindhias is the theatre of incessant murders and pillage .  The poor wretch! exclaimed Passepartout , to be burned alive!  Yes , returned Sir Francis , burned alive .  And , if she were not , you cannot conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from her relatives .  They would shave off her hair , feed her on a scanty allowance of rice , treat her with contempt; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature , and would die in some corner , like a scurvy dog . The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism . Sometimes , however , the sacrifice is really voluntary , and it requires the active interference of the Government to prevent it .  Several years ago , when I was living at Bombay , a young widow asked permission of the governor to be burned along with her husbands body; but , as you may imagine , he refused .  The woman left the town , took refuge with an independent rajah , and there carried out her self-devoted purpose .  While Sir Francis was speaking , the guide shook his head several times , and now said: The sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is not a voluntary one .  How do you know ?  Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund .  But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistance , observed Sir Francis .  That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and opium .  But where are they taking her ?  To the pagoda of Pillaji , two miles from here; she will pass the night there .  And the sacrifice will take place--  To-morrow , at the first light of dawn .  The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket , and leaped upon his neck .  Just at the moment that he was about to urge Kiouni forward with a peculiar whistle , Mr . Fogg stopped him , and , turning to Sir Francis Cromarty , said , Suppose we save this woman .  Save the woman , Mr . Fogg!  I have yet twelve hours to spare; I can devote them to that .  Why , you are a man of heart!  Sometimes , replied Phileas Fogg , quietly; when I have the time .     Chapter XIII  IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT RECEIVES A NEW PROOF THAT FORTUNE FAVORS THE BRAVE   The project was a bold one , full of difficulty , perhaps impracticable . Mr . Fogg was going to risk life , or at least liberty , and therefore the success of his tour .  But he did not hesitate , and he found in Sir Francis Cromarty an enthusiastic ally .  As for Passepartout , he was ready for anything that might be proposed . His masters idea charmed him; he perceived a heart , a soul , under that icy exterior .  He began to love Phileas Fogg .  There remained the guide: what course would he adopt ?  Would he not take part with the Indians ?  In default of his assistance , it was necessary to be assured of his neutrality .  Sir Francis frankly put the question to him .  Officers , replied the guide , I am a Parsee , and this woman is a Parsee .  Command me as you will .  Excellent! said Mr . Fogg .  However , resumed the guide , it is certain , not only that we shall risk our lives , but horrible tortures , if we are taken .  That is foreseen , replied Mr . Fogg .  I think we must wait till night before acting .  I think so , said the guide .  The worthy Indian then gave some account of the victim , who , he said , was a celebrated beauty of the Parsee race , and the daughter of a wealthy Bombay merchant .  She had received a thoroughly English education in that city , and , from her manners and intelligence , would be thought an European .  Her name was Aouda .  Left an orphan , she was married against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund; and , knowing the fate that awaited her , she escaped , was retaken , and devoted by the rajahs relatives , who had an interest in her death , to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape .  The Parsees narrative only confirmed Mr . Fogg and his companions in their generous design .  It was decided that the guide should direct the elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji , which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible .  They halted , half an hour afterwards , in a copse , some five hundred feet from the pagoda , where they were well concealed; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs distinctly .  They then discussed the means of getting at the victim .  The guide was familiar with the pagoda of Pillaji , in which , as he declared , the young woman was imprisoned .  Could they enter any of its doors while the whole party of Indians was plunged in a drunken sleep , or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls ?  This could only be determined at the moment and the place themselves; but it was certain that the abduction must be made that night , and not when , at break of day , the victim was led to her funeral pyre .  Then no human intervention could save her .  As soon as night fell , about six oclock , they decided to make a reconnaissance around the pagoda .  The cries of the fakirs were just ceasing; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp , and it might be possible to slip between them to the temple itself .  The Parsee , leading the others , noiselessly crept through the wood , and in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream , whence , by the light of the rosin torches , they perceived a pyre of wood , on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah , which was to be burned with his wife .  The pagoda , whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening dusk , stood a hundred steps away .  Come! whispered the guide .  He slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush , followed by his companions; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of the wind among the branches .  Soon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade , which was lit up by the torches .  The ground was covered by groups of the Indians , motionless in their drunken sleep; it seemed a battlefield strewn with the dead .  Men , women , and children lay together .  In the background , among the trees , the pagoda of Pillaji loomed distinctly .  Much to the guides disappointment , the guards of the rajah , lighted by torches , were watching at the doors and marching to and fro with naked sabres; probably the priests , too , were watching within .  The Parsee , now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance to the temple , advanced no farther , but led his companions back again . Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty also saw that nothing could be attempted in that direction .  They stopped , and engaged in a whispered colloquy .  It is only eight now , said the brigadier , and these guards may also go to sleep .  It is not impossible , returned the Parsee .  They lay down at the foot of a tree , and waited .  The time seemed long; the guide ever and anon left them to take an observation on the edge of the wood , but the guards watched steadily by the glare of the torches , and a dim light crept through the windows of the pagoda .  They waited till midnight; but no change took place among the guards , and it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could not be counted on .  The other plan must be carried out; an opening in the walls of the pagoda must be made .  It remained to ascertain whether the priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as were the soldiers at the door .  After a last consultation , the guide announced that he was ready for the attempt , and advanced , followed by the others .  They took a roundabout way , so as to get at the pagoda on the rear .  They reached the walls about half-past twelve , without having met anyone; here there was no guard , nor were there either windows or doors .  The night was dark .  The moon , on the wane , scarcely left the horizon , and was covered with heavy clouds; the height of the trees deepened the darkness .  It was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be accomplished , and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket-knives .  Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood , which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one brick had been taken out , the rest would yield easily .  They set noiselessly to work , and the Parsee on one side and Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide .  They were getting on rapidly , when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple , followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside .  Passepartout and the guide stopped .  Had they been heard ?  Was the alarm being given ?  Common prudence urged them to retire , and they did so , followed by Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis .  They again hid themselves in the wood , and waited till the disturbance , whatever it might be , ceased , holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay .  But , awkwardly enough , the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple , and there installed themselves , in readiness to prevent a surprise .  It would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party , thus interrupted in their work .  They could not now reach the victim; how , then , could they save her ?  Sir Francis shook his fists , Passepartout was beside himself , and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage .  The tranquil Fogg waited , without betraying any emotion .  We have nothing to do but to go away , whispered Sir Francis .  Nothing but to go away , echoed the guide .  Stop , said Fogg .  I am only due at Allahabad tomorrow before noon .  But what can you hope to do ? asked Sir Francis .  In a few hours it will be daylight , and--  The chance which now seems lost may present itself at the last moment .  Sir Francis would have liked to read Phileas Foggs eyes .  What was this cool Englishman thinking of ?  Was he planning to make a rush for the young woman at the very moment of the sacrifice , and boldly snatch her from her executioners ?  This would be utter folly , and it was hard to admit that Fogg was such a fool .  Sir Francis consented , however , to remain to the end of this terrible drama .  The guide led them to the rear of the glade , where they were able to observe the sleeping groups .  Meanwhile Passepartout , who had perched himself on the lower branches of a tree , was resolving an idea which had at first struck him like a flash , and which was now firmly lodged in his brain .  He had commenced by saying to himself , What folly! and then he repeated , Why not , after all ?  Its a chance ,--perhaps the only one; and with such sots! Thinking thus , he slipped , with the suppleness of a serpent , to the lowest branches , the ends of which bent almost to the ground .  The hours passed , and the lighter shades now announced the approach of day , though it was not yet light .  This was the moment .  The slumbering multitude became animated , the tambourines sounded , songs and cries arose; the hour of the sacrifice had come .  The doors of the pagoda swung open , and a bright light escaped from its interior , in the midst of which Mr . Fogg and Sir Francis espied the victim .  She seemed , having shaken off the stupor of intoxication , to be striving to escape from her executioner .  Sir Franciss heart throbbed; and , convulsively seizing Mr . Foggs hand , found in it an open knife .  Just at this moment the crowd began to move .  The young woman had again fallen into a stupor caused by the fumes of hemp , and passed among the fakirs , who escorted her with their wild , religious cries .  Phileas Fogg and his companions , mingling in the rear ranks of the crowd , followed; and in two minutes they reached the banks of the stream , and stopped fifty paces from the pyre , upon which still lay the rajahs corpse .  In the semi-obscurity they saw the victim , quite senseless , stretched out beside her husbands body . Then a torch was brought , and the wood , heavily soaked with oil , instantly took fire .  At this moment Sir Francis and the guide seized Phileas Fogg , who , in an instant of mad generosity , was about to rush upon the pyre .  But he had quickly pushed them aside , when the whole scene suddenly changed . A cry of terror arose .  The whole multitude prostrated themselves , terror-stricken , on the ground .  The old rajah was not dead , then , since he rose of a sudden , like a spectre , took up his wife in his arms , and descended from the pyre in the midst of the clouds of smoke , which only heightened his ghostly appearance .  Fakirs and soldiers and priests , seized with instant terror , lay there , with their faces on the ground , not daring to lift their eyes and behold such a prodigy .  The inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which supported her , and which she did not seem in the least to burden .  Mr . Fogg and Sir Francis stood erect , the Parsee bowed his head , and Passepartout was , no doubt , scarcely less stupefied .  The resuscitated rajah approached Sir Francis and Mr . Fogg , and , in an abrupt tone , said , Let us be off!  It was Passepartout himself , who had slipped upon the pyre in the midst of the smoke and , profiting by the still overhanging darkness , had delivered the young woman from death!  It was Passepartout who , playing his part with a happy audacity , had passed through the crowd amid the general terror .  A moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods , and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace . But the cries and noise , and a ball which whizzed through Phileas Foggs hat , apprised them that the trick had been discovered .  The old rajahs body , indeed , now appeared upon the burning pyre; and the priests , recovered from their terror , perceived that an abduction had taken place .  They hastened into the forest , followed by the soldiers , who fired a volley after the fugitives; but the latter rapidly increased the distance between them , and ere long found themselves beyond the reach of the bullets and arrows .     Chapter XIV  IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG DESCENDS THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE BEAUTIFUL VALLEY OF THE GANGES WITHOUT EVER THINKING OF SEEING IT   The rash exploit had been accomplished; and for an hour Passepartout laughed gaily at his success .  Sir Francis pressed the worthy fellows hand , and his master said , Well done! which , from him , was high commendation; to which Passepartout replied that all the credit of the affair belonged to Mr . Fogg .  As for him , he had only been struck with a queer idea; and he laughed to think that for a few moments he , Passepartout , the ex-gymnast , ex-sergeant fireman , had been the spouse of a charming woman , a venerable , embalmed rajah!  As for the young Indian woman , she had been unconscious throughout of what was passing , and now , wrapped up in a travelling-blanket , was reposing in one of the howdahs .  The elephant , thanks to the skilful guidance of the Parsee , was advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest , and , an hour after leaving the pagoda , had crossed a vast plain .  They made a halt at seven oclock , the young woman being still in a state of complete prostration .  The guide made her drink a little brandy and water , but the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off .  Sir Francis , who was familiar with the effects of the intoxication produced by the fumes of hemp , reassured his companions on her account .  But he was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate .  He told Phileas Fogg that , should Aouda remain in India , she would inevitably fall again into the hands of her executioners .  These fanatics were scattered throughout the county , and would , despite the English police , recover their victim at Madras , Bombay , or Calcutta .  She would only be safe by quitting India for ever .  Phileas Fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matter .  The station at Allahabad was reached about ten oclock , and , the interrupted line of railway being resumed , would enable them to reach Calcutta in less than twenty-four hours .  Phileas Fogg would thus be able to arrive in time to take the steamer which left Calcutta the next day , October 25th , at noon , for Hong Kong .  The young woman was placed in one of the waiting-rooms of the station , whilst Passepartout was charged with purchasing for her various articles of toilet , a dress , shawl , and some furs; for which his master gave him unlimited credit .  Passepartout started off forthwith , and found himself in the streets of Allahabad , that is , the City of God , one of the most venerated in India , being built at the junction of the two sacred rivers , Ganges and Jumna , the waters of which attract pilgrims from every part of the peninsula .  The Ganges , according to the legends of the Ramayana , rises in heaven , whence , owing to Brahmas agency , it descends to the earth .  Passepartout made it a point , as he made his purchases , to take a good look at the city .  It was formerly defended by a noble fort , which has since become a state prison; its commerce has dwindled away , and Passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar as he used to frequent in Regent Street .  At last he came upon an elderly , crusty Jew , who sold second-hand articles , and from whom he purchased a dress of Scotch stuff , a large mantle , and a fine otter-skin pelisse , for which he did not hesitate to pay seventy-five pounds .  He then returned triumphantly to the station .  The influence to which the priests of Pillaji had subjected Aouda began gradually to yield , and she became more herself , so that her fine eyes resumed all their soft Indian expression .  When the poet-king , Ucaf Uddaul , celebrates the charms of the queen of Ahmehnagara , he speaks thus:  Her shining tresses , divided in two parts , encircle the harmonious contour of her white and delicate cheeks , brilliant in their glow and freshness .  Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of Kama , the god of love , and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim , as in the sacred lakes of Himalaya , in the black pupils of her great clear eyes .  Her teeth , fine , equal , and white , glitter between her smiling lips like dewdrops in a passion-flowers half-enveloped breast .  Her delicately formed ears , her vermilion hands , her little feet , curved and tender as the lotus-bud , glitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of Ceylon , the most dazzling diamonds of Golconda .  Her narrow and supple waist , which a hand may clasp around , sets forth the outline of her rounded figure and the beauty of her bosom , where youth in its flower displays the wealth of its treasures; and beneath the silken folds of her tunic she seems to have been modelled in pure silver by the godlike hand of Vicvarcarma , the immortal sculptor .  It is enough to say , without applying this poetical rhapsody to Aouda , that she was a charming woman , in all the European acceptation of the phrase .  She spoke English with great purity , and the guide had not exaggerated in saying that the young Parsee had been transformed by her bringing up .  The train was about to start from Allahabad , and Mr . Fogg proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service , and not a farthing more; which astonished Passepartout , who remembered all that his master owed to the guides devotion .  He had , indeed , risked his life in the adventure at Pillaji , and , if he should be caught afterwards by the Indians , he would with difficulty escape their vengeance .  Kiouni , also , must be disposed of .  What should be done with the elephant , which had been so dearly purchased ?  Phileas Fogg had already determined this question .  Parsee , said he to the guide , you have been serviceable and devoted . I have paid for your service , but not for your devotion .  Would you like to have this elephant ?  He is yours .  The guides eyes glistened .  Your honour is giving me a fortune! cried he .  Take him , guide , returned Mr . Fogg , and I shall still be your debtor .  Good! exclaimed Passepartout .  Take him , friend .  Kiouni is a brave and faithful beast .  And , going up to the elephant , he gave him several lumps of sugar , saying , Here , Kiouni , here , here .  The elephant grunted out his satisfaction , and , clasping Passepartout around the waist with his trunk , lifted him as high as his head . Passepartout , not in the least alarmed , caressed the animal , which replaced him gently on the ground .  Soon after , Phileas Fogg , Sir Francis Cromarty , and Passepartout , installed in a carriage with Aouda , who had the best seat , were whirling at full speed towards Benares .  It was a run of eighty miles , and was accomplished in two hours .  During the journey , the young woman fully recovered her senses .  What was her astonishment to find herself in this carriage , on the railway , dressed in European habiliments , and with travellers who were quite strangers to her!  Her companions first set about fully reviving her with a little liquor , and then Sir Francis narrated to her what had passed , dwelling upon the courage with which Phileas Fogg had not hesitated to risk his life to save her , and recounting the happy sequel of the venture , the result of Passepartouts rash idea .  Mr . Fogg said nothing; while Passepartout , abashed , kept repeating that it wasnt worth telling .  Aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers , rather with tears than words; her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her lips . Then , as her thoughts strayed back to the scene of the sacrifice , and recalled the dangers which still menaced her , she shuddered with terror .  Phileas Fogg understood what was passing in Aoudas mind , and offered , in order to reassure her , to escort her to Hong Kong , where she might remain safely until the affair was hushed up--an offer which she eagerly and gratefully accepted .  She had , it seems , a Parsee relation , who was one of the principal merchants of Hong Kong , which is wholly an English city , though on an island on the Chinese coast .  At half-past twelve the train stopped at Benares .  The Brahmin legends assert that this city is built on the site of the ancient Casi , which , like Mahomets tomb , was once suspended between heaven and earth; though the Benares of to-day , which the Orientalists call the Athens of India , stands quite unpoetically on the solid earth , Passepartout caught glimpses of its brick houses and clay huts , giving an aspect of desolation to the place , as the train entered it .  Benares was Sir Francis Cromartys destination , the troops he was rejoining being encamped some miles northward of the city .  He bade adieu to Phileas Fogg , wishing him all success , and expressing the hope that he would come that way again in a less original but more profitable fashion .  Mr . Fogg lightly pressed him by the hand .  The parting of Aouda , who did not forget what she owed to Sir Francis , betrayed more warmth; and , as for Passepartout , he received a hearty shake of the hand from the gallant general .  The railway , on leaving Benares , passed for a while along the valley of the Ganges .  Through the windows of their carriage the travellers had glimpses of the diversified landscape of Behar , with its mountains clothed in verdure , its fields of barley , wheat , and corn , its jungles peopled with green alligators , its neat villages , and its still thickly-leaved forests .  Elephants were bathing in the waters of the sacred river , and groups of Indians , despite the advanced season and chilly air , were performing solemnly their pious ablutions .  These were fervent Brahmins , the bitterest foes of Buddhism , their deities being Vishnu , the solar god , Shiva , the divine impersonation of natural forces , and Brahma , the supreme ruler of priests and legislators .  What would these divinities think of India , anglicised as it is to-day , with steamers whistling and scudding along the Ganges , frightening the gulls which float upon its surface , the turtles swarming along its banks , and the faithful dwelling upon its borders ?  The panorama passed before their eyes like a flash , save when the steam concealed it fitfully from the view; the travellers could scarcely discern the fort of Chupenie , twenty miles south-westward from Benares , the ancient stronghold of the rajahs of Behar; or Ghazipur and its famous rose-water factories; or the tomb of Lord Cornwallis , rising on the left bank of the Ganges; the fortified town of Buxar , or Patna , a large manufacturing and trading-place , where is held the principal opium market of India; or Monghir , a more than European town , for it is as English as Manchester or Birmingham , with its iron foundries , edgetool factories , and high chimneys puffing clouds of black smoke heavenward .  Night came on; the train passed on at full speed , in the midst of the roaring of the tigers , bears , and wolves which fled before the locomotive; and the marvels of Bengal , Golconda ruined Gour , Murshedabad , the ancient capital , Burdwan , Hugly , and the French town of Chandernagor , where Passepartout would have been proud to see his countrys flag flying , were hidden from their view in the darkness .  Calcutta was reached at seven in the morning , and the packet left for Hong Kong at noon; so that Phileas Fogg had five hours before him .  According to his journal , he was due at Calcutta on the 25th of October , and that was the exact date of his actual arrival .  He was therefore neither behind-hand nor ahead of time .  The two days gained between London and Bombay had been lost , as has been seen , in the journey across India .  But it is not to be supposed that Phileas Fogg regretted them .     Chapter XV  IN WHICH THE BAG OF BANKNOTES DISGORGES SOME THOUSANDS OF POUNDS MORE   The train entered the station , and Passepartout jumping out first , was followed by Mr . Fogg , who assisted his fair companion to descend . Phileas Fogg intended to proceed at once to the Hong Kong steamer , in order to get Aouda comfortably settled for the voyage .  He was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground .  Just as he was leaving the station a policeman came up to him , and said , Mr . Phileas Fogg ?  I am he .  Is this man your servant ? added the policeman , pointing to Passepartout .  Yes .  Be so good , both of you , as to follow me .  Mr . Fogg betrayed no surprise whatever .  The policeman was a representative of the law , and law is sacred to an Englishman . Passepartout tried to reason about the matter , but the policeman tapped him with his stick , and Mr . Fogg made him a signal to obey .  May this young lady go with us ? asked he .  She may , replied the policeman .  Mr . Fogg , Aouda , and Passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri , a sort of four-wheeled carriage , drawn by two horses , in which they took their places and were driven away .  No one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination .  They first passed through the black town , with its narrow streets , its miserable , dirty huts , and squalid population; then through the European town , which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions , shaded by coconut-trees and bristling with masts , where , although it was early morning , elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth .  The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house , which , however , did not have the appearance of a private mansion .  The policeman having requested his prisoners--for so , truly , they might be called--to descend , conducted them into a room with barred windows , and said:  You will appear before Judge Obadiah at half-past eight .  He then retired , and closed the door .  Why , we are prisoners! exclaimed Passepartout , falling into a chair .  Aouda , with an emotion she tried to conceal , said to Mr . Fogg: Sir , you must leave me to my fate!  It is on my account that you receive this treatment , it is for having saved me!  Phileas Fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible .  It was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee . The complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge . There was some mistake .  Moreover , he would not , in any event , abandon Aouda , but would escort her to Hong Kong .  But the steamer leaves at noon! observed Passepartout , nervously .  We shall be on board by noon , replied his master , placidly .  It was said so positively that Passepartout could not help muttering to himself , Parbleu thats certain!  Before noon we shall be on board . But he was by no means reassured .  At half-past eight the door opened , the policeman appeared , and , requesting them to follow him , led the way to an adjoining hall .  It was evidently a court-room , and a crowd of Europeans and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment .  Mr . Fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk .  Immediately after , Judge Obadiah , a fat , round man , followed by the clerk , entered .  He proceeded to take down a wig which was hanging on a nail , and put it hurriedly on his head .  The first case , said he .  Then , putting his hand to his head , he exclaimed , Heh!  This is not my wig!  No , your worship , returned the clerk , it is mine .  My dear Mr . Oysterpuff , how can a judge give a wise sentence in a clerks wig ?  The wigs were exchanged .  Passepartout was getting nervous , for the hands on the face of the big clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible rapidity .  The first case , repeated Judge Obadiah .  Phileas Fogg ? demanded Oysterpuff .  I am here , replied Mr . Fogg .  Passepartout ?  Present , responded Passepartout .  Good , said the judge .  You have been looked for , prisoners , for two days on the trains from Bombay .  But of what are we accused ? asked Passepartout , impatiently .  You are about to be informed .  I am an English subject , sir , said Mr . Fogg , and I have the right--  Have you been ill-treated ?  Not at all .  Very well; let the complainants come in .  A door was swung open by order of the judge , and three Indian priests entered .  Thats it , muttered Passepartout; these are the rogues who were going to burn our young lady .  The priests took their places in front of the judge , and the clerk proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege against Phileas Fogg and his servant , who were accused of having violated a place held consecrated by the Brahmin religion .  You hear the charge ? asked the judge .  Yes , sir , replied Mr . Fogg , consulting his watch , and I admit it .  You admit it ?  I admit it , and I wish to hear these priests admit , in their turn , what they were going to do at the pagoda of Pillaji .  The priests looked at each other; they did not seem to understand what was said .  Yes , cried Passepartout , warmly; at the pagoda of Pillaji , where they were on the point of burning their victim .  The judge stared with astonishment , and the priests were stupefied .  What victim ? said Judge Obadiah .  Burn whom ?  In Bombay itself ?  Bombay ? cried Passepartout .  Certainly .  We are not talking of the pagoda of Pillaji , but of the pagoda of Malabar Hill , at Bombay .  And as a proof , added the clerk , here are the desecrators very shoes , which he left behind him .  Whereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his desk .  My shoes! cried Passepartout , in his surprise permitting this imprudent exclamation to escape him .  The confusion of master and man , who had quite forgotten the affair at Bombay , for which they were now detained at Calcutta , may be imagined .  Fix the detective , had foreseen the advantage which Passepartouts escapade gave him , and , delaying his departure for twelve hours , had consulted the priests of Malabar Hill .  Knowing that the English authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour , he promised them a goodly sum in damages , and sent them forward to Calcutta by the next train .  Owing to the delay caused by the rescue of the young widow , Fix and the priests reached the Indian capital before Mr . Fogg and his servant , the magistrates having been already warned by a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive .  Fixs disappointment when he learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in Calcutta may be imagined .  He made up his mind that the robber had stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces .  For twenty-four hours Fix watched the station with feverish anxiety; at last he was rewarded by seeing Mr . Fogg and Passepartout arrive , accompanied by a young woman , whose presence he was wholly at a loss to explain .  He hastened for a policeman; and this was how the party came to be arrested and brought before Judge Obadiah .  Had Passepartout been a little less preoccupied , he would have espied the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room , watching the proceedings with an interest easily understood; for the warrant had failed to reach him at Calcutta , as it had done at Bombay and Suez .  Judge Obadiah had unfortunately caught Passepartouts rash exclamation , which the poor fellow would have given the world to recall .  The facts are admitted ? asked the judge .  Admitted , replied Mr . Fogg , coldly .  Inasmuch , resumed the judge , as the English law protects equally and sternly the religions of the Indian people , and as the man Passepartout has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of Malabar Hill , at Bombay , on the 20th of October , I condemn the said Passepartout to imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds .  Three hundred pounds! cried Passepartout , startled at the largeness of the sum .  Silence! shouted the constable .  And inasmuch , continued the judge , as it is not proved that the act was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant , and as the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his paid servant , I condemn Phileas Fogg to a weeks imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty pounds .  Fix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction; if Phileas Fogg could be detained in Calcutta a week , it would be more than time for the warrant to arrive .  Passepartout was stupefied .  This sentence ruined his master .  A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost , because he , like a precious fool , had gone into that abominable pagoda!  Phileas Fogg , as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least concern him , did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being pronounced .  Just as the clerk was calling the next case , he rose , and said , I offer bail .  You have that right , returned the judge .  Fixs blood ran cold , but he resumed his composure when he heard the judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one thousand pounds .  I will pay it at once , said Mr . Fogg , taking a roll of bank-bills from the carpet-bag , which Passepartout had by him , and placing them on the clerks desk .  This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison , said the judge .  Meanwhile , you are liberated on bail .  Come! said Phileas Fogg to his servant .  But let them at least give me back my shoes! cried Passepartout angrily .  Ah , these are pretty dear shoes! he muttered , as they were handed to him .  More than a thousand pounds apiece; besides , they pinch my feet .  Mr . Fogg , offering his arm to Aouda , then departed , followed by the crestfallen Passepartout .  Fix still nourished hopes that the robber would not , after all , leave the two thousand pounds behind him , but would decide to serve out his week in jail , and issued forth on Mr . Foggs traces .  That gentleman took a carriage , and the party were soon landed on one of the quays .  The Rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour , its signal of departure hoisted at the mast-head .  Eleven oclock was striking; Mr . Fogg was an hour in advance of time .  Fix saw them leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer , and stamped his feet with disappointment .  The rascal is off , after all! he exclaimed .  Two thousand pounds sacrificed!  Hes as prodigal as a thief!  Ill follow him to the end of the world if necessary; but , at the rate he is going on , the stolen money will soon be exhausted .  The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture .  Since leaving London , what with travelling expenses , bribes , the purchase of the elephant , bails , and fines , Mr . Fogg had already spent more than five thousand pounds on the way , and the percentage of the sum recovered from the bank robber promised to the detectives , was rapidly diminishing .     Chapter XVI  IN WHICH FIX DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IN THE LEAST WHAT IS SAID TO HIM   The Rangoon--one of the Peninsular and Oriental Companys boats plying in the Chinese and Japanese seas--was a screw steamer , built of iron , weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons , and with engines of four hundred horse-power .  She was as fast , but not as well fitted up , as the Mongolia , and Aouda was not as comfortably provided for on board of her as Phileas Fogg could have wished .  However , the trip from Calcutta to Hong Kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred miles , occupying from ten to twelve days , and the young woman was not difficult to please .  During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted with her protector , and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude for what he had done .  The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her , apparently at least , with coldness , neither his voice nor his manner betraying the slightest emotion; but he seemed to be always on the watch that nothing should be wanting to Aoudas comfort .  He visited her regularly each day at certain hours , not so much to talk himself , as to sit and hear her talk .  He treated her with the strictest politeness , but with the precision of an automaton , the movements of which had been arranged for this purpose .  Aouda did not quite know what to make of him , though Passepartout had given her some hints of his masters eccentricity , and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was sending him round the world .  After all , she owed Phileas Fogg her life , and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude .  Aouda confirmed the Parsee guides narrative of her touching history . She did , indeed , belong to the highest of the native races of India . Many of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing in cotton; and one of them , Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy , was made a baronet by the English government .  Aouda was a relative of this great man , and it was his cousin , Jeejeeh , whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong . Whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell; but Mr . Fogg essayed to calm her anxieties , and to assure her that everything would be mathematically--he used the very word--arranged .  Aouda fastened her great eyes , clear as the sacred lakes of the Himalaya , upon him; but the intractable Fogg , as reserved as ever , did not seem at all inclined to throw himself into this lake .  The first few days of the voyage passed prosperously , amid favourable weather and propitious winds , and they soon came in sight of the great Andaman , the principal of the islands in the Bay of Bengal , with its picturesque Saddle Peak , two thousand four hundred feet high , looming above the waters .  The steamer passed along near the shores , but the savage Papuans , who are in the lowest scale of humanity , but are not , as has been asserted , cannibals , did not make their appearance .  The panorama of the islands , as they steamed by them , was superb .  Vast forests of palms , arecs , bamboo , teakwood , of the gigantic mimosa , and tree-like ferns covered the foreground , while behind , the graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky; and along the coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the Celestial Empire .  The varied landscape afforded by the Andaman Islands was soon passed , however , and the Rangoon rapidly approached the Straits of Malacca , which gave access to the China seas .  What was detective Fix , so unluckily drawn on from country to country , doing all this while ?  He had managed to embark on the Rangoon at Calcutta without being seen by Passepartout , after leaving orders that , if the warrant should arrive , it should be forwarded to him at Hong Kong; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage . It would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without awakening Passepartouts suspicions , who thought him still at Bombay . But necessity impelled him , nevertheless , to renew his acquaintance with the worthy servant , as will be seen .  All the detectives hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong; for the steamers stay at Singapore would be too brief to enable him to take any steps there .  The arrest must be made at Hong Kong , or the robber would probably escape him for ever .  Hong Kong was the last English ground on which he would set foot; beyond , China , Japan , America offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge .  If the warrant should at last make its appearance at Hong Kong , Fix could arrest him and give him into the hands of the local police , and there would be no further trouble .  But beyond Hong Kong , a simple warrant would be of no avail; an extradition warrant would be necessary , and that would result in delays and obstacles , of which the rascal would take advantage to elude justice .  Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he spent in his cabin , and kept repeating to himself , Now , either the warrant will be at Hong Kong , in which case I shall arrest my man , or it will not be there; and this time it is absolutely necessary that I should delay his departure .  I have failed at Bombay , and I have failed at Calcutta; if I fail at Hong Kong , my reputation is lost:  Cost what it may , I must succeed!  But how shall I prevent his departure , if that should turn out to be my last resource ?  Fix made up his mind that , if worst came to worst , he would make a confidant of Passepartout , and tell him what kind of a fellow his master really was .  That Passepartout was not Foggs accomplice , he was very certain .  The servant , enlightened by his disclosure , and afraid of being himself implicated in the crime , would doubtless become an ally of the detective .  But this method was a dangerous one , only to be employed when everything else had failed .  A word from Passepartout to his master would ruin all .  The detective was therefore in a sore strait .  But suddenly a new idea struck him .  The presence of Aouda on the Rangoon , in company with Phileas Fogg , gave him new material for reflection .  Who was this woman ?  What combination of events had made her Foggs travelling companion ?  They had evidently met somewhere between Bombay and Calcutta; but where ?  Had they met accidentally , or had Fogg gone into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel ?  Fix was fairly puzzled .  He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked elopement; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he determined to make use of the supposed intrigue .  Whether the young woman were married or not , he would be able to create such difficulties for Mr . Fogg at Hong Kong that he could not escape by paying any amount of money .  But could he even wait till they reached Hong Kong ?  Fogg had an abominable way of jumping from one boat to another , and , before anything could be effected , might get full under way again for Yokohama .  Fix decided that he must warn the English authorities , and signal the Rangoon before her arrival .  This was easy to do , since the steamer stopped at Singapore , whence there is a telegraphic wire to Hong Kong . He finally resolved , moreover , before acting more positively , to question Passepartout .  It would not be difficult to make him talk; and , as there was no time to lose , Fix prepared to make himself known .  It was now the 30th of October , and on the following day the Rangoon was due at Singapore .  Fix emerged from his cabin and went on deck .  Passepartout was promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer .  The detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise , and exclaimed , You here , on the Rangoon ?  What , Monsieur Fix , are you on board ? returned the really astonished Passepartout , recognising his crony of the Mongolia .  Why , I left you at Bombay , and here you are , on the way to Hong Kong!  Are you going round the world too ?  No , no , replied Fix; I shall stop at Hong Kong--at least for some days .  Hum! said Passepartout , who seemed for an instant perplexed .  But how is it I have not seen you on board since we left Calcutta ?  Oh , a trifle of sea-sickness--Ive been staying in my berth .  The Gulf of Bengal does not agree with me as well as the Indian Ocean .  And how is Mr . Fogg ?  As well and as punctual as ever , not a day behind time!  But , Monsieur Fix , you dont know that we have a young lady with us .  A young lady ? replied the detective , not seeming to comprehend what was said .  Passepartout thereupon recounted Aoudas history , the affair at the Bombay pagoda , the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds , the rescue , the arrest , and sentence of the Calcutta court , and the restoration of Mr . Fogg and himself to liberty on bail .  Fix , who was familiar with the last events , seemed to be equally ignorant of all that Passepartout related; and the later was charmed to find so interested a listener .  But does your master propose to carry this young woman to Europe ?  Not at all .  We are simply going to place her under the protection of one of her relatives , a rich merchant at Hong Kong .  Nothing to be done there , said Fix to himself , concealing his disappointment .  A glass of gin , Mr . Passepartout ?  Willingly , Monsieur Fix .  We must at least have a friendly glass on board the Rangoon .     Chapter XVII  SHOWING WHAT HAPPENED ON THE VOYAGE FROM SINGAPORE TO HONG KONG   The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this interview , though Fix was reserved , and did not attempt to induce his companion to divulge any more facts concerning Mr . Fogg .  He caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice; but Mr . Fogg usually confined himself to the cabin , where he kept Aouda company , or , according to his inveterate habit , took a hand at whist .  Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing .  It was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent person , whom he had first met at Suez , had then encountered on board the Mongolia , who disembarked at Bombay , which he announced as his destination , and now turned up so unexpectedly on the Rangoon , was following Mr . Foggs tracks step by step .  What was Fixs object ? Passepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes--which he religiously preserved--that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with them , and probably on the same steamer .  Passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view .  He never could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber around the globe .  But , as it is in human nature to attempt the solution of every mystery , Passepartout suddenly discovered an explanation of Fixs movements , which was in truth far from unreasonable .  Fix , he thought , could only be an agent of Mr . Foggs friends at the Reform Club , sent to follow him up , and to ascertain that he really went round the world as had been agreed upon .  Its clear! repeated the worthy servant to himself , proud of his shrewdness .  Hes a spy sent to keep us in view!  That isnt quite the thing , either , to be spying Mr . Fogg , who is so honourable a man!  Ah , gentlemen of the Reform , this shall cost you dear!  Passepartout , enchanted with his discovery , resolved to say nothing to his master , lest he should be justly offended at this mistrust on the part of his adversaries .  But he determined to chaff Fix , when he had the chance , with mysterious allusions , which , however , need not betray his real suspicions .  During the afternoon of Wednesday , 30th October , the Rangoon entered the Strait of Malacca , which separates the peninsula of that name from Sumatra .  The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of this noble island from the view of the travellers .  The Rangoon weighed anchor at Singapore the next day at four a .m . , to receive coal , having gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival .  Phileas Fogg noted this gain in his journal , and then , accompanied by Aouda , who betrayed a desire for a walk on shore , disembarked .  Fix , who suspected Mr . Foggs every movement , followed them cautiously , without being himself perceived; while Passepartout , laughing in his sleeve at Fixs manoeuvres , went about his usual errands .  The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect , for there are no mountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions .  It is a park checkered by pleasant highways and avenues .  A handsome carriage , drawn by a sleek pair of New Holland horses , carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage , and of clove-trees , whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower . Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields; sago-bushes , large ferns with gorgeous branches , varied the aspect of this tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air with a penetrating perfume .  Agile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped about in the trees , nor were tigers wanting in the jungles .  After a drive of two hours through the country , Aouda and Mr . Fogg returned to the town , which is a vast collection of heavy-looking , irregular houses , surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical fruits and plants; and at ten oclock they re-embarked , closely followed by the detective , who had kept them constantly in sight .  Passepartout , who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes--a fruit as large as good-sized apples , of a dark-brown colour outside and a bright red within , and whose white pulp , melting in the mouth , affords gourmands a delicious sensation--was waiting for them on deck .  He was only too glad to offer some mangoes to Aouda , who thanked him very gracefully for them .  At eleven oclock the Rangoon rode out of Singapore harbour , and in a few hours the high mountains of Malacca , with their forests , inhabited by the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world , were lost to view . Singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of Hong Kong , which is a little English colony near the Chinese coast . Phileas Fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days , so as to be in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of November for Yokohama , the principal Japanese port .  The Rangoon had a large quota of passengers , many of whom disembarked at Singapore , among them a number of Indians , Ceylonese , Chinamen , Malays , and Portuguese , mostly second-class travellers .  The weather , which had hitherto been fine , changed with the last quarter of the moon .  The sea rolled heavily , and the wind at intervals rose almost to a storm , but happily blew from the south-west , and thus aided the steamers progress .  The captain as often as possible put up his sails , and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel made rapid progress along the coasts of Anam and Cochin China .  Owing to the defective construction of the Rangoon , however , unusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather; but the loss of time which resulted from this cause , while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses , did not seem to affect his master in the least . Passepartout blamed the captain , the engineer , and the crew , and consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the pepper grows .  Perhaps the thought of the gas , which was remorselessly burning at his expense in Saville Row , had something to do with his hot impatience .  You are in a great hurry , then , said Fix to him one day , to reach Hong Kong ?  A very great hurry!  Mr . Fogg , I suppose , is anxious to catch the steamer for Yokohama ?  Terribly anxious .  You believe in this journey around the world , then ?  Absolutely .  Dont you , Mr . Fix ?  I ?  I dont believe a word of it .  Youre a sly dog! said Passepartout , winking at him .  This expression rather disturbed Fix , without his knowing why .  Had the Frenchman guessed his real purpose ?  He knew not what to think .  But how could Passepartout have discovered that he was a detective ?  Yet , in speaking as he did , the man evidently meant more than he expressed .  Passepartout went still further the next day; he could not hold his tongue .  Mr . Fix , said he , in a bantering tone , shall we be so unfortunate as to lose you when we get to Hong Kong ?  Why , responded Fix , a little embarrassed , I dont know; perhaps--  Ah , if you would only go on with us!  An agent of the Peninsular Company , you know , cant stop on the way!  You were only going to Bombay , and here you are in China .  America is not far off , and from America to Europe is only a step .  Fix looked intently at his companion , whose countenance was as serene as possible , and laughed with him .  But Passepartout persisted in chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation .  Yes , and no , returned Fix; there is good and bad luck in such things .  But you must understand that I dont travel at my own expense .  Oh , I am quite sure of that! cried Passepartout , laughing heartily .  Fix , fairly puzzled , descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his reflections .  He was evidently suspected; somehow or other the Frenchman had found out that he was a detective .  But had he told his master ?  What part was he playing in all this: was he an accomplice or not ?  Was the game , then , up ?  Fix spent several hours turning these things over in his mind , sometimes thinking that all was lost , then persuading himself that Fogg was ignorant of his presence , and then undecided what course it was best to take .  Nevertheless , he preserved his coolness of mind , and at last resolved to deal plainly with Passepartout .  If he did not find it practicable to arrest Fogg at Hong Kong , and if Fogg made preparations to leave that last foothold of English territory , he , Fix , would tell Passepartout all .  Either the servant was the accomplice of his master , and in this case the master knew of his operations , and he should fail; or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery , and then his interest would be to abandon the robber .  Such was the situation between Fix and Passepartout .  Meanwhile Phileas Fogg moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious indifference .  He was passing methodically in his orbit around the world , regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him .  Yet there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star , which might have produced an agitation in this gentlemans heart .  But no! the charms of Aouda failed to act , to Passepartouts great surprise; and the disturbances , if they existed , would have been more difficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery of Neptune .  It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout , who read in Aoudas eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master .  Phileas Fogg , though brave and gallant , must be , he thought , quite heartless .  As to the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him , there was clearly no trace of such a thing; while poor Passepartout existed in perpetual reveries .  One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room , and was observing the engine , when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the screw out of the water .  The steam came hissing out of the valves; and this made Passepartout indignant .  The valves are not sufficiently charged! he exclaimed .  We are not going .  Oh , these English!  If this was an American craft , we should blow up , perhaps , but we should at all events go faster!     Chapter XVIII  IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG , PASSEPARTOUT , AND FIX GO EACH ABOUT HIS BUSINESS   The weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage .  The wind , obstinately remaining in the north-west , blew a gale , and retarded the steamer .  The Rangoon rolled heavily and the passengers became impatient of the long , monstrous waves which the wind raised before their path .  A sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of November , the squall knocking the vessel about with fury , and the waves running high .  The Rangoon reefed all her sails , and even the rigging proved too much , whistling and shaking amid the squall .  The steamer was forced to proceed slowly , and the captain estimated that she would reach Hong Kong twenty hours behind time , and more if the storm lasted .  Phileas Fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea , which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him , with his habitual tranquillity .  He never changed countenance for an instant , though a delay of twenty hours , by making him too late for the Yokohama boat , would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager .  But this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme , and had been foreseen .  Aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him .  Fix did not look at the state of things in the same light .  The storm greatly pleased him .  His satisfaction would have been complete had the Rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves . Each delay filled him with hope , for it became more and more probable that Fogg would be obliged to remain some days at Hong Kong; and now the heavens themselves became his allies , with the gusts and squalls . It mattered not that they made him sea-sick--he made no account of this inconvenience; and , whilst his body was writhing under their effects , his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation .  Passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather . Everything had gone so well till now!  Earth and sea had seemed to be at his masters service; steamers and railways obeyed him; wind and steam united to speed his journey .  Had the hour of adversity come ? Passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket .  The storm exasperated him , the gale made him furious , and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience . Poor fellow!  Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction , for , had he betrayed it , Passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence .  Passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted , being unable to remain quiet below , and taking it into his head to aid the progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew .  He overwhelmed the captain , officers , and sailors , who could not help laughing at his impatience , with all sorts of questions .  He wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last; whereupon he was referred to the barometer , which seemed to have no intention of rising .  Passepartout shook it , but with no perceptible effect; for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon it to change its mind .  On the 4th , however , the sea became more calm , and the storm lessened its violence; the wind veered southward , and was once more favourable . Passepartout cleared up with the weather .  Some of the sails were unfurled , and the Rangoon resumed its most rapid speed .  The time lost could not , however , be regained .  Land was not signalled until five oclock on the morning of the 6th; the steamer was due on the 5th . Phileas Fogg was twenty-four hours behind-hand , and the Yokohama steamer would , of course , be missed .  The pilot went on board at six , and took his place on the bridge , to guide the Rangoon through the channels to the port of Hong Kong . Passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for Yokohama; but he dared not , for he wished to preserve the spark of hope , which still remained till the last moment .  He had confided his anxiety to Fix who--the sly rascal!--tried to console him by saying that Mr . Fogg would be in time if he took the next boat; but this only put Passepartout in a passion .  Mr . Fogg , bolder than his servant , did not hesitate to approach the pilot , and tranquilly ask him if he knew when a steamer would leave Hong Kong for Yokohama .  At high tide to-morrow morning , answered the pilot .  Ah! said Mr . Fogg , without betraying any astonishment .  Passepartout , who heard what passed , would willingly have embraced the pilot , while Fix would have been glad to twist his neck .  What is the steamers name ? asked Mr . Fogg .  The Carnatic .  Ought she not to have gone yesterday ?  Yes , sir; but they had to repair one of her boilers , and so her departure was postponed till to-morrow .  Thank you , returned Mr . Fogg , descending mathematically to the saloon .  Passepartout clasped the pilots hand and shook it heartily in his delight , exclaiming , Pilot , you are the best of good fellows!  The pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses won him this enthusiastic greeting .  He remounted the bridge , and guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks , tankas , and fishing boats which crowd the harbour of Hong Kong .  At one oclock the Rangoon was at the quay , and the passengers were going ashore .  Chance had strangely favoured Phileas Fogg , for had not the Carnatic been forced to lie over for repairing her boilers , she would have left on the 6th of November , and the passengers for Japan would have been obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer .  Mr . Fogg was , it is true , twenty-four hours behind his time; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder of his tour .  The steamer which crossed the Pacific from Yokohama to San Francisco made a direct connection with that from Hong Kong , and it could not sail until the latter reached Yokohama; and if Mr . Fogg was twenty-four hours late on reaching Yokohama , this time would no doubt be easily regained in the voyage of twenty-two days across the Pacific .  He found himself , then , about twenty-four hours behind-hand , thirty-five days after leaving London .  The Carnatic was announced to leave Hong Kong at five the next morning . Mr . Fogg had sixteen hours in which to attend to his business there , which was to deposit Aouda safely with her wealthy relative .  On landing , he conducted her to a palanquin , in which they repaired to the Club Hotel .  A room was engaged for the young woman , and Mr . Fogg , after seeing that she wanted for nothing , set out in search of her cousin Jeejeeh .  He instructed Passepartout to remain at the hotel until his return , that Aouda might not be left entirely alone .  Mr . Fogg repaired to the Exchange , where , he did not doubt , every one would know so wealthy and considerable a personage as the Parsee merchant .  Meeting a broker , he made the inquiry , to learn that Jeejeeh had left China two years before , and , retiring from business with an immense fortune , had taken up his residence in Europe--in Holland the broker thought , with the merchants of which country he had principally traded .  Phileas Fogg returned to the hotel , begged a moments conversation with Aouda , and without more ado , apprised her that Jeejeeh was no longer at Hong Kong , but probably in Holland .  Aouda at first said nothing .  She passed her hand across her forehead , and reflected a few moments .  Then , in her sweet , soft voice , she said: What ought I to do , Mr . Fogg ?  It is very simple , responded the gentleman .  Go on to Europe .  But I cannot intrude--  You do not intrude , nor do you in the least embarrass my project . Passepartout!  Monsieur .  Go to the Carnatic , and engage three cabins .  Passepartout , delighted that the young woman , who was very gracious to him , was going to continue the journey with them , went off at a brisk gait to obey his masters order .     Chapter XIX  IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT TAKES A TOO GREAT INTEREST IN HIS MASTER , AND WHAT COMES OF IT   Hong Kong is an island which came into the possession of the English by the Treaty of Nankin , after the war of 1842; and the colonising genius of the English has created upon it an important city and an excellent port .  The island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River , and is separated by about sixty miles from the Portuguese town of Macao , on the opposite coast .  Hong Kong has beaten Macao in the struggle for the Chinese trade , and now the greater part of the transportation of Chinese goods finds its depot at the former place .  Docks , hospitals , wharves , a Gothic cathedral , a government house , macadamised streets , give to Hong Kong the appearance of a town in Kent or Surrey transferred by some strange magic to the antipodes .  Passepartout wandered , with his hands in his pockets , towards the Victoria port , gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other modes of conveyance , and the groups of Chinese , Japanese , and Europeans who passed to and fro in the streets .  Hong Kong seemed to him not unlike Bombay , Calcutta , and Singapore , since , like them , it betrayed everywhere the evidence of English supremacy .  At the Victoria port he found a confused mass of ships of all nations: English , French , American , and Dutch , men-of-war and trading vessels , Japanese and Chinese junks , sempas , tankas , and flower-boats , which formed so many floating parterres .  Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow .  On going into a barbers to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all at least eighty years old , at which age they are permitted to wear yellow , which is the Imperial colour .  Passepartout , without exactly knowing why , thought this very funny .  On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the Carnatic , he was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down .  The detective seemed very much disturbed and disappointed .  This is bad , muttered Passepartout , for the gentlemen of the Reform Club!  He accosted Fix with a merry smile , as if he had not perceived that gentlemans chagrin .  The detective had , indeed , good reasons to inveigh against the bad luck which pursued him .  The warrant had not come!  It was certainly on the way , but as certainly it could not now reach Hong Kong for several days; and , this being the last English territory on Mr . Foggs route , the robber would escape , unless he could manage to detain him .  Well , Monsieur Fix , said Passepartout , have you decided to go with us so far as America ?  Yes , returned Fix , through his set teeth .  Good! exclaimed Passepartout , laughing heartily .  I knew you could not persuade yourself to separate from us .  Come and engage your berth .  They entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four persons . The clerk , as he gave them the tickets , informed them that , the repairs on the Carnatic having been completed , the steamer would leave that very evening , and not next morning , as had been announced .  That will suit my master all the better , said Passepartout .  I will go and let him know .  Fix now decided to make a bold move; he resolved to tell Passepartout all .  It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping Phileas Fogg several days longer at Hong Kong .  He accordingly invited his companion into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay .  On entering , they found themselves in a large room handsomely decorated , at the end of which was a large camp-bed furnished with cushions .  Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep .  At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer , porter , gin , and brandy; smoking , the while , long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose .  From time to time one of the smokers , overcome with the narcotic , would slip under the table , whereupon the waiters , taking him by the head and feet , carried and laid him upon the bed .  The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots .  Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched , cadaverous , idiotic creatures to whom the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium , to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds--thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity!  The Chinese government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws .  It passed gradually from the rich , to whom it was at first exclusively reserved , to the lower classes , and then its ravages could not be arrested .  Opium is smoked everywhere , at all times , by men and women , in the Celestial Empire; and , once accustomed to it , the victims cannot dispense with it , except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies .  A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day; but he dies in five years .  It was in one of these dens that Fix and Passepartout , in search of a friendly glass , found themselves .  Passepartout had no money , but willingly accepted Fixs invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time .  They ordered two bottles of port , to which the Frenchman did ample justice , whilst Fix observed him with close attention .  They chatted about the journey , and Passepartout was especially merry at the idea that Fix was going to continue it with them .  When the bottles were empty , however , he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the Carnatic .  Fix caught him by the arm , and said , Wait a moment .  What for , Mr . Fix ?  I want to have a serious talk with you .  A serious talk! cried Passepartout , drinking up the little wine that was left in the bottom of his glass .  Well , well talk about it to-morrow; I havent time now .  Stay!  What I have to say concerns your master .  Passepartout , at this , looked attentively at his companion .  Fixs face seemed to have a singular expression .  He resumed his seat .  What is it that you have to say ?  Fix placed his hand upon Passepartouts arm , and , lowering his voice , said , You have guessed who I am ?  Parbleu! said Passepartout , smiling .  Then Im going to tell you everything--  Now that I know everything , my friend!  Ah! thats very good .  But go on , go on .  First , though , let me tell you that those gentlemen have put themselves to a useless expense .  Useless! said Fix .  You speak confidently .  Its clear that you dont know how large the sum is .  Of course I do , returned Passepartout .  Twenty thousand pounds .  Fifty-five thousand! answered Fix , pressing his companions hand .  What! cried the Frenchman .  Has Monsieur Fogg dared--fifty-five thousand pounds!  Well , theres all the more reason for not losing an instant , he continued , getting up hastily .  Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair , and resumed: Fifty-five thousand pounds; and if I succeed , I get two thousand pounds .  If youll help me , Ill let you have five hundred of them .  Help you ? cried Passepartout , whose eyes were standing wide open .  Yes; help me keep Mr . Fogg here for two or three days .  Why , what are you saying ?  Those gentlemen are not satisfied with following my master and suspecting his honour , but they must try to put obstacles in his way!  I blush for them!  What do you mean ?  I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery .  They might as well waylay Mr . Fogg and put his money in their pockets!  Thats just what we count on doing .  Its a conspiracy , then , cried Passepartout , who became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head , for he drank without perceiving it .  A real conspiracy!  And gentlemen , too . Bah!  Fix began to be puzzled .  Members of the Reform Club! continued Passepartout .  You must know , Monsieur Fix , that my master is an honest man , and that , when he makes a wager , he tries to win it fairly!  But who do you think I am ? asked Fix , looking at him intently .  Parbleu!  An agent of the members of the Reform Club , sent out here to interrupt my masters journey .  But , though I found you out some time ago , Ive taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr . Fogg .  He knows nothing , then ?  Nothing , replied Passepartout , again emptying his glass .  The detective passed his hand across his forehead , hesitating before he spoke again .  What should he do ?  Passepartouts mistake seemed sincere , but it made his design more difficult .  It was evident that the servant was not the masters accomplice , as Fix had been inclined to suspect .  Well , said the detective to himself , as he is not an accomplice , he will help me .  He had no time to lose: Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong , so he resolved to make a clean breast of it .  Listen to me , said Fix abruptly .  I am not , as you think , an agent of the members of the Reform Club--  Bah! retorted Passepartout , with an air of raillery .  I am a police detective , sent out here by the London office .  You , a detective ?  I will prove it .  Here is my commission .  Passepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this document , the genuineness of which could not be doubted .  Mr . Foggs wager , resumed Fix , is only a pretext , of which you and the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes .  He had a motive for securing your innocent complicity .  But why ?  Listen .  On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five thousand pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose description was fortunately secured .  Here is his description; it answers exactly to that of Mr . Phileas Fogg .  What nonsense! cried Passepartout , striking the table with his fist . My master is the most honourable of men!  How can you tell ?  You know scarcely anything about him .  You went into his service the day he came away; and he came away on a foolish pretext , without trunks , and carrying a large amount in banknotes .  And yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man!  Yes , yes , repeated the poor fellow , mechanically .  Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice ?  Passepartout , overcome by what he had heard , held his head between his hands , and did not dare to look at the detective .  Phileas Fogg , the saviour of Aouda , that brave and generous man , a robber!  And yet how many presumptions there were against him!  Passepartout essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind; he did not wish to believe that his master was guilty .  Well , what do you want of me ? said he , at last , with an effort .  See here , replied Fix; I have tracked Mr . Fogg to this place , but as yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent to London .  You must help me to keep him here in Hong Kong--  I!  But I--  I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the Bank of England .  Never! replied Passepartout , who tried to rise , but fell back , exhausted in mind and body .  Mr . Fix , he stammered , even should what you say be true--if my master is really the robber you are seeking for--which I deny--I have been , am , in his service; I have seen his generosity and goodness; and I will never betray him--not for all the gold in the world .  I come from a village where they dont eat that kind of bread!  You refuse ?  I refuse .  Consider that Ive said nothing , said Fix; and let us drink .  Yes; let us drink!  Passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the liquor .  Fix , seeing that he must , at all hazards , be separated from his master , wished to entirely overcome him .  Some pipes full of opium lay upon the table .  Fix slipped one into Passepartouts hand .  He took it , put it between his lips , lit it , drew several puffs , and his head , becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic , fell upon the table .  At last! said Fix , seeing Passepartout unconscious .  Mr . Fogg will not be informed of the Carnatics departure; and , if he is , he will have to go without this cursed Frenchman!  And , after paying his bill , Fix left the tavern .     Chapter XX  IN WHICH FIX COMES FACE TO FACE WITH PHILEAS FOGG   While these events were passing at the opium-house , Mr . Fogg , unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer , was quietly escorting Aouda about the streets of the English quarter , making the necessary purchases for the long voyage before them .  It was all very well for an Englishman like Mr . Fogg to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions .  He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity , and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion , who was confused by his patience and generosity:  It is in the interest of my journey--a part of my programme .  The purchases made , they returned to the hotel , where they dined at a sumptuously served table-dhote; after which Aouda , shaking hands with her protector after the English fashion , retired to her room for rest . Mr . Fogg absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal of The Times and Illustrated London News .  Had he been capable of being astonished at anything , it would have been not to see his servant return at bedtime .  But , knowing that the steamer was not to leave for Yokohama until the next morning , he did not disturb himself about the matter .  When Passepartout did not appear the next morning to answer his masters bell , Mr . Fogg , not betraying the least vexation , contented himself with taking his carpet-bag , calling Aouda , and sending for a palanquin .  It was then eight oclock; at half-past nine , it being then high tide , the Carnatic would leave the harbour .  Mr . Fogg and Aouda got into the palanquin , their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow , and half an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark .  Mr . Fogg then learned that the Carnatic had sailed the evening before .  He had expected to find not only the steamer , but his domestic , and was forced to give up both; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his face , and he merely remarked to Aouda , It is an accident , madam; nothing more .  At this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approached . It was Fix , who , bowing , addressed Mr . Fogg:  Were you not , like me , sir , a passenger by the Rangoon , which arrived yesterday ?  I was , sir , replied Mr . Fogg coldly .  But I have not the honour--  Pardon me; I thought I should find your servant here .  Do you know where he is , sir ? asked Aouda anxiously .  What! responded Fix , feigning surprise .  Is he not with you ?  No , said Aouda .  He has not made his appearance since yesterday . Could he have gone on board the Carnatic without us ?  Without you , madam ? answered the detective .  Excuse me , did you intend to sail in the Carnatic ?  Yes , sir .  So did I , madam , and I am excessively disappointed .  The Carnatic , its repairs being completed , left Hong Kong twelve hours before the stated time , without any notice being given; and we must now wait a week for another steamer .  As he said a week Fix felt his heart leap for joy .  Fogg detained at Hong Kong for a week!  There would be time for the warrant to arrive , and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law .  His horror may be imagined when he heard Mr . Fogg say , in his placid voice , But there are other vessels besides the Carnatic , it seems to me , in the harbour of Hong Kong .  And , offering his arm to Aouda , he directed his steps toward the docks in search of some craft about to start .  Fix , stupefied , followed; it seemed as if he were attached to Mr . Fogg by an invisible thread . Chance , however , appeared really to have abandoned the man it had hitherto served so well .  For three hours Phileas Fogg wandered about the docks , with the determination , if necessary , to charter a vessel to carry him to Yokohama; but he could only find vessels which were loading or unloading , and which could not therefore set sail .  Fix began to hope again .  But Mr . Fogg , far from being discouraged , was continuing his search , resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao , when he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves .  Is your honour looking for a boat ?  Have you a boat ready to sail ?  Yes , your honour; a pilot-boat--No . 43--the best in the harbour .  Does she go fast ?  Between eight and nine knots the hour .  Will you look at her ?  Yes .  Your honour will be satisfied with her .  Is it for a sea excursion ?  No; for a voyage .  A voyage ?  Yes , will you agree to take me to Yokohama ?  The sailor leaned on the railing , opened his eyes wide , and said , Is your honour joking ?  No .  I have missed the Carnatic , and I must get to Yokohama by the 14th at the latest , to take the boat for San Francisco .  I am sorry , said the sailor; but it is impossible .  I offer you a hundred pounds per day , and an additional reward of two hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time .  Are you in earnest ?  Very much so .  The pilot walked away a little distance , and gazed out to sea , evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the fear of venturing so far .  Fix was in mortal suspense .  Mr . Fogg turned to Aouda and asked her , You would not be afraid , would you , madam ?  Not with you , Mr . Fogg , was her answer .  The pilot now returned , shuffling his hat in his hands .  Well , pilot ? said Mr . Fogg .  Well , your honour , replied he , I could not risk myself , my men , or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time of year .  Besides , we could not reach Yokohama in time , for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong .  Only sixteen hundred , said Mr . Fogg .  Its the same thing .  Fix breathed more freely .  But , added the pilot , it might be arranged another way .  Fix ceased to breathe at all .  How ? asked Mr . Fogg .  By going to Nagasaki , at the extreme south of Japan , or even to Shanghai , which is only eight hundred miles from here .  In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast , which would be a great advantage , as the currents run northward , and would aid us .  Pilot , said Mr . Fogg , I must take the American steamer at Yokohama , and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki .  Why not ? returned the pilot .  The San Francisco steamer does not start from Yokohama .  It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki , but it starts from Shanghai .  You are sure of that ?  Perfectly .  And when does the boat leave Shanghai ?  On the 11th , at seven in the evening .  We have , therefore , four days before us , that is ninety-six hours; and in that time , if we had good luck and a south-west wind , and the sea was calm , we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai .  And you could go--  In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up .  It is a bargain .  Are you the master of the boat ?  Yes; John Bunsby , master of the Tankadere .  Would you like some earnest-money ?  If it would not put your honour out--  Here are two hundred pounds on account sir , added Phileas Fogg , turning to Fix , if you would like to take advantage--  Thanks , sir; I was about to ask the favour .  Very well .  In half an hour we shall go on board .  But poor Passepartout ? urged Aouda , who was much disturbed by the servants disappearance .  I shall do all I can to find him , replied Phileas Fogg .  While Fix , in a feverish , nervous state , repaired to the pilot-boat , the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong . Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartouts description , and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him .  The same formalities having been gone through at the French consulate , and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage , which had been sent back there , they returned to the wharf .  It was now three oclock; and pilot-boat No . 43 , with its crew on board , and its provisions stored away , was ready for departure .  The Tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons , as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht .  Her shining copper sheathing , her galvanised iron-work , her deck , white as ivory , betrayed the pride taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable .  Her two masts leaned a trifle backward; she carried brigantine , foresail , storm-jib , and standing-jib , and was well rigged for running before the wind; and she seemed capable of brisk speed , which , indeed , she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races .  The crew of the Tankadere was composed of John Bunsby , the master , and four hardy mariners , who were familiar with the Chinese seas .  John Bunsby , himself , a man of forty-five or thereabouts , vigorous , sunburnt , with a sprightly expression of the eye , and energetic and self-reliant countenance , would have inspired confidence in the most timid .  Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board , where they found Fix already installed .  Below deck was a square cabin , of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots , above a circular divan; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp .  The accommodation was confined , but neat .  I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you , said Mr . Fogg to Fix , who bowed without responding .  The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of Mr . Fogg .  Its certain , thought he , though rascal as he is , he is a polite one!  The sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three . Mr . Fogg and Aouda , who were seated on deck , cast a last glance at the quay , in the hope of espying Passepartout .  Fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant , whom he had so badly treated , in this direction; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued .  But the Frenchman did not appear , and , without doubt , was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium .  John Bunsby , master , at length gave the order to start , and the Tankadere , taking the wind under her brigantine , foresail , and standing-jib , bounded briskly forward over the waves .     Chapter XXI  IN WHICH THE MASTER OF THE TANKADERE RUNS GREAT RISK OF LOSING A REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS   This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of twenty tons , and at that season of the year .  The Chinese seas are usually boisterous , subject to terrible gales of wind , and especially during the equinoxes; and it was now early November .  It would clearly have been to the masters advantage to carry his passengers to Yokohama , since he was paid a certain sum per day; but he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage , and it was imprudent even to attempt to reach Shanghai .  But John Bunsby believed in the Tankadere , which rode on the waves like a seagull; and perhaps he was not wrong .  Late in the day they passed through the capricious channels of Hong Kong , and the Tankadere , impelled by favourable winds , conducted herself admirably .  I do not need , pilot , said Phileas Fogg , when they got into the open sea , to advise you to use all possible speed .  Trust me , your honour .  We are carrying all the sail the wind will let us .  The poles would add nothing , and are only used when we are going into port .  Its your trade , not mine , pilot , and I confide in you .  Phileas Fogg , with body erect and legs wide apart , standing like a sailor , gazed without staggering at the swelling waters .  The young woman , who was seated aft , was profoundly affected as she looked out upon the ocean , darkening now with the twilight , on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel .  Above her head rustled the white sails , which seemed like great white wings .  The boat , carried forward by the wind , seemed to be flying in the air .  Night came .  The moon was entering her first quarter , and her insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon . Clouds were rising from the east , and already overcast a part of the heavens .  The pilot had hung out his lights , which was very necessary in these seas crowded with vessels bound landward; for collisions are not uncommon occurrences , and , at the speed she was going , the least shock would shatter the gallant little craft .  Fix , seated in the bow , gave himself up to meditation .  He kept apart from his fellow-travellers , knowing Mr . Foggs taciturn tastes; besides , he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had accepted .  He was thinking , too , of the future .  It seemed certain that Fogg would not stop at Yokohama , but would at once take the boat for San Francisco; and the vast extent of America would ensure him impunity and safety .  Foggs plan appeared to him the simplest in the world . Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States , like a common villain , he had traversed three quarters of the globe , so as to gain the American continent more surely; and there , after throwing the police off his track , he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune stolen from the bank .  But , once in the United States , what should he , Fix , do ?  Should he abandon this man ?  No , a hundred times no!  Until he had secured his extradition , he would not lose sight of him for an hour .  It was his duty , and he would fulfil it to the end .  At all events , there was one thing to be thankful for; Passepartout was not with his master; and it was above all important , after the confidences Fix had imparted to him , that the servant should never have speech with his master .  Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout , who had so strangely disappeared .  Looking at the matter from every point of view , it did not seem to him impossible that , by some mistake , the man might have embarked on the Carnatic at the last moment; and this was also Aoudas opinion , who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow to whom she owed so much .  They might then find him at Yokohama; for , if the Carnatic was carrying him thither , it would be easy to ascertain if he had been on board .  A brisk breeze arose about ten oclock; but , though it might have been prudent to take in a reef , the pilot , after carefully examining the heavens , let the craft remain rigged as before .  The Tankadere bore sail admirably , as she drew a great deal of water , and everything was prepared for high speed in case of a gale .  Mr . Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight , having been already preceded by Fix , who had lain down on one of the cots .  The pilot and crew remained on deck all night .  At sunrise the next day , which was 8th November , the boat had made more than one hundred miles .  The log indicated a mean speed of between eight and nine miles .  The Tankadere still carried all sail , and was accomplishing her greatest capacity of speed .  If the wind held as it was , the chances would be in her favour .  During the day she kept along the coast , where the currents were favourable; the coast , irregular in profile , and visible sometimes across the clearings , was at most five miles distant .  The sea was less boisterous , since the wind came off land--a fortunate circumstance for the boat , which would suffer , owing to its small tonnage , by a heavy surge on the sea .  The breeze subsided a little towards noon , and set in from the south-west .  The pilot put up his poles , but took them down again within two hours , as the wind freshened up anew .  Mr . Fogg and Aouda , happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea , ate with a good appetite , Fix being invited to share their repast , which he accepted with secret chagrin .  To travel at this mans expense and live upon his provisions was not palatable to him .  Still , he was obliged to eat , and so he ate .  When the meal was over , he took Mr . Fogg apart , and said , sir--this sir scorched his lips , and he had to control himself to avoid collaring this gentleman--sir , you have been very kind to give me a passage on this boat .  But , though my means will not admit of my expending them as freely as you , I must ask to pay my share--  Let us not speak of that , sir , replied Mr . Fogg .  But , if I insist--  No , sir , repeated Mr . Fogg , in a tone which did not admit of a reply . This enters into my general expenses .  Fix , as he bowed , had a stifled feeling , and , going forward , where he ensconced himself , did not open his mouth for the rest of the day .  Meanwhile they were progressing famously , and John Bunsby was in high hope .  He several times assured Mr . Fogg that they would reach Shanghai in time; to which that gentleman responded that he counted upon it . The crew set to work in good earnest , inspired by the reward to be gained .  There was not a sheet which was not tightened , not a sail which was not vigorously hoisted; not a lurch could be charged to the man at the helm .  They worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a Royal yacht regatta .  By evening , the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been accomplished from Hong Kong , and Mr . Fogg might hope that he would be able to reach Yokohama without recording any delay in his journal; in which case , the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he left London would not seriously affect his journey .  The Tankadere entered the Straits of Fo-Kien , which separate the island of Formosa from the Chinese coast , in the small hours of the night , and crossed the Tropic of Cancer .  The sea was very rough in the straits , full of eddies formed by the counter-currents , and the chopping waves broke her course , whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck .  At daybreak the wind began to blow hard again , and the heavens seemed to predict a gale .  The barometer announced a speedy change , the mercury rising and falling capriciously; the sea also , in the south-east , raised long surges which indicated a tempest .  The sun had set the evening before in a red mist , in the midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean .  John Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens , muttering indistinctly between his teeth .  At last he said in a low voice to Mr . Fogg , Shall I speak out to your honour ?  Of course .  Well , we are going to have a squall .  Is the wind north or south ? asked Mr . Fogg quietly .  South .  Look! a typhoon is coming up .  Glad its a typhoon from the south , for it will carry us forward .  Oh , if you take it that way , said John Bunsby , Ive nothing more to say . John Bunsbys suspicions were confirmed .  At a less advanced season of the year the typhoon , according to a famous meteorologist , would have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame; but in the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them with great violence .  The pilot took his precautions in advance .  He reefed all sail , the pole-masts were dispensed with; all hands went forward to the bows .  A single triangular sail , of strong canvas , was hoisted as a storm-jib , so as to hold the wind from behind .  Then they waited .  John Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this imprisonment in so narrow a space , with little air , and the boat bouncing in the gale , was far from pleasant .  Neither Mr . Fogg , Fix , nor Aouda consented to leave the deck .  The storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight oclock . With but its bit of sail , the Tankadere was lifted like a feather by a wind , an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given .  To compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be below the truth .  The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day , borne on by monstrous waves , preserving always , fortunately , a speed equal to theirs .  Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these mountains of water which rose behind her; but the adroit management of the pilot saved her .  The passengers were often bathed in spray , but they submitted to it philosophically .  Fix cursed it , no doubt; but Aouda , with her eyes fastened upon her protector , whose coolness amazed her , showed herself worthy of him , and bravely weathered the storm .  As for Phileas Fogg , it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his programme .  Up to this time the Tankadere had always held her course to the north; but towards evening the wind , veering three quarters , bore down from the north-west .  The boat , now lying in the trough of the waves , shook and rolled terribly; the sea struck her with fearful violence .  At night the tempest increased in violence .  John Bunsby saw the approach of darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivings .  He thought awhile , and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken speed .  After a consultation he approached Mr . Fogg , and said , I think , your honour , that we should do well to make for one of the ports on the coast .  I think so too .  Ah! said the pilot .  But which one ?  I know of but one , returned Mr . Fogg tranquilly .  And that is--  Shanghai .  The pilot , at first , did not seem to comprehend; he could scarcely realise so much determination and tenacity .  Then he cried , Well--yes! Your honour is right .  To Shanghai!  So the Tankadere kept steadily on her northward track .  The night was really terrible; it would be a miracle if the craft did not founder .  Twice it could have been all over with her if the crew had not been constantly on the watch .  Aouda was exhausted , but did not utter a complaint .  More than once Mr . Fogg rushed to protect her from the violence of the waves .  Day reappeared .  The tempest still raged with undiminished fury; but the wind now returned to the south-east .  It was a favourable change , and the Tankadere again bounded forward on this mountainous sea , though the waves crossed each other , and imparted shocks and counter-shocks which would have crushed a craft less solidly built .  From time to time the coast was visible through the broken mist , but no vessel was in sight .  The Tankadere was alone upon the sea .  There were some signs of a calm at noon , and these became more distinct as the sun descended toward the horizon .  The tempest had been as brief as terrific .  The passengers , thoroughly exhausted , could now eat a little , and take some repose .  The night was comparatively quiet .  Some of the sails were again hoisted , and the speed of the boat was very good .  The next morning at dawn they espied the coast , and John Bunsby was able to assert that they were not one hundred miles from Shanghai .  A hundred miles , and only one day to traverse them!  That very evening Mr . Fogg was due at Shanghai , if he did not wish to miss the steamer to Yokohama .  Had there been no storm , during which several hours were lost , they would be at this moment within thirty miles of their destination .  The wind grew decidedly calmer , and happily the sea fell with it .  All sails were now hoisted , and at noon the Tankadere was within forty-five miles of Shanghai .  There remained yet six hours in which to accomplish that distance .  All on board feared that it could not be done , and every one--Phileas Fogg , no doubt , excepted--felt his heart beat with impatience .  The boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour , and the wind was becoming calmer every moment!  It was a capricious breeze , coming from the coast , and after it passed the sea became smooth .  Still , the Tankadere was so light , and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well , that , with the aid of the currents John Bunsby found himself at six oclock not more than ten miles from the mouth of Shanghai River .  Shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream .  At seven they were still three miles from Shanghai .  The pilot swore an angry oath; the reward of two hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him .  He looked at Mr . Fogg .  Mr . Fogg was perfectly tranquil; and yet his whole fortune was at this moment at stake .  At this moment , also , a long black funnel , crowned with wreaths of smoke , appeared on the edge of the waters .  It was the American steamer , leaving for Yokohama at the appointed time .  Confound her! cried John Bunsby , pushing back the rudder with a desperate jerk .  Signal her! said Phileas Fogg quietly .  A small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the Tankadere , for making signals in the fogs .  It was loaded to the muzzle; but just as the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole , Mr . Fogg said , Hoist your flag!  The flag was run up at half-mast , and , this being the signal of distress , it was hoped that the American steamer , perceiving it , would change her course a little , so as to succour the pilot-boat .  Fire! said Mr . Fogg .  And the booming of the little cannon resounded in the air .     Chapter XXII  IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT FINDS OUT THAT , EVEN AT THE ANTIPODES , IT IS CONVENIENT TO HAVE SOME MONEY IN ONES POCKET   The Carnatic , setting sail from Hong Kong at half-past six on the 7th of November , directed her course at full steam towards Japan .  She carried a large cargo and a well-filled cabin of passengers .  Two state-rooms in the rear were , however , unoccupied--those which had been engaged by Phileas Fogg .  The next day a passenger with a half-stupefied eye , staggering gait , and disordered hair , was seen to emerge from the second cabin , and to totter to a seat on deck .  It was Passepartout; and what had happened to him was as follows: Shortly after Fix left the opium den , two waiters had lifted the unconscious Passepartout , and had carried him to the bed reserved for the smokers .  Three hours later , pursued even in his dreams by a fixed idea , the poor fellow awoke , and struggled against the stupefying influence of the narcotic .  The thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off his torpor , and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness .  Staggering and holding himself up by keeping against the walls , falling down and creeping up again , and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct , he kept crying out , The Carnatic! the Carnatic!  The steamer lay puffing alongside the quay , on the point of starting . Passepartout had but few steps to go; and , rushing upon the plank , he crossed it , and fell unconscious on the deck , just as the Carnatic was moving off .  Several sailors , who were evidently accustomed to this sort of scene , carried the poor Frenchman down into the second cabin , and Passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty miles away from China .  Thus he found himself the next morning on the deck of the Carnatic , and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea-breeze . The pure air sobered him .  He began to collect his sense , which he found a difficult task; but at last he recalled the events of the evening before , Fixs revelation , and the opium-house .  It is evident , said he to himself , that I have been abominably drunk!  What will Mr . Fogg say ?  At least I have not missed the steamer , which is the most important thing .  Then , as Fix occurred to him: As for that rascal , I hope we are well rid of him , and that he has not dared , as he proposed , to follow us on board the Carnatic .  A detective on the track of Mr . Fogg , accused of robbing the Bank of England!  Pshaw!  Mr . Fogg is no more a robber than I am a murderer .  Should he divulge Fixs real errand to his master ?  Would it do to tell the part the detective was playing ?  Would it not be better to wait until Mr . Fogg reached London again , and then impart to him that an agent of the metropolitan police had been following him round the world , and have a good laugh over it ?  No doubt; at least , it was worth considering .  The first thing to do was to find Mr . Fogg , and apologise for his singular behaviour .  Passepartout got up and proceeded , as well as he could with the rolling of the steamer , to the after-deck .  He saw no one who resembled either his master or Aouda .  Good!  muttered he; Aouda has not got up yet , and Mr . Fogg has probably found some partners at whist .  He descended to the saloon .  Mr . Fogg was not there .  Passepartout had only , however , to ask the purser the number of his masters state-room . The purser replied that he did not know any passenger by the name of Fogg .  I beg your pardon , said Passepartout persistently .  He is a tall gentleman , quiet , and not very talkative , and has with him a young lady--  There is no young lady on board , interrupted the purser .  Here is a list of the passengers; you may see for yourself .  Passepartout scanned the list , but his masters name was not upon it . All at once an idea struck him .  Ah! am I on the Carnatic ?  Yes .  On the way to Yokohama ?  Certainly .  Passepartout had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong boat; but , though he was really on the Carnatic , his master was not there .  He fell thunderstruck on a seat .  He saw it all now .  He remembered that the time of sailing had been changed , that he should have informed his master of that fact , and that he had not done so .  It was his fault , then , that Mr . Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer .  Yes , but it was still more the fault of the traitor who , in order to separate him from his master , and detain the latter at Hong Kong , had inveigled him into getting drunk!  He now saw the detectives trick; and at this moment Mr . Fogg was certainly ruined , his bet was lost , and he himself perhaps arrested and imprisoned!  At this thought Passepartout tore his hair .  Ah , if Fix ever came within his reach , what a settling of accounts there would be!  After his first depression , Passepartout became calmer , and began to study his situation .  It was certainly not an enviable one .  He found himself on the way to Japan , and what should he do when he got there ? His pocket was empty; he had not a solitary shilling , not so much as a penny .  His passage had fortunately been paid for in advance; and he had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course .  He fell to at meals with an appetite , and ate for Mr . Fogg , Aouda , and himself .  He helped himself as generously as if Japan were a desert , where nothing to eat was to be looked for .  At dawn on the 13th the Carnatic entered the port of Yokohama .  This is an important port of call in the Pacific , where all the mail-steamers , and those carrying travellers between North America , China , Japan , and the Oriental islands put in .  It is situated in the bay of Yeddo , and at but a short distance from that second capital of the Japanese Empire , and the residence of the Tycoon , the civil Emperor , before the Mikado , the spiritual Emperor , absorbed his office in his own .  The Carnatic anchored at the quay near the custom-house , in the midst of a crowd of ships bearing the flags of all nations .  Passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of the Sons of the Sun .  He had nothing better to do than , taking chance for his guide , to wander aimlessly through the streets of Yokohama .  He found himself at first in a thoroughly European quarter , the houses having low fronts , and being adorned with verandas , beneath which he caught glimpses of neat peristyles .  This quarter occupied , with its streets , squares , docks , and warehouses , all the space between the promontory of the Treaty and the river .  Here , as at Hong Kong and Calcutta , were mixed crowds of all races , Americans and English , Chinamen and Dutchmen , mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything . The Frenchman felt himself as much alone among them as if he had dropped down in the midst of Hottentots .  He had , at least , one resource ,--to call on the French and English consuls at Yokohama for assistance .  But he shrank from telling the story of his adventures , intimately connected as it was with that of his master; and , before doing so , he determined to exhaust all other means of aid .  As chance did not favour him in the European quarter , he penetrated that inhabited by the native Japanese , determined , if necessary , to push on to Yeddo .  The Japanese quarter of Yokohama is called Benten , after the goddess of the sea , who is worshipped on the islands round about .  There Passepartout beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves , sacred gates of a singular architecture , bridges half hid in the midst of bamboos and reeds , temples shaded by immense cedar-trees , holy retreats where were sheltered Buddhist priests and sectaries of Confucius , and interminable streets , where a perfect harvest of rose-tinted and red-cheeked children , who looked as if they had been cut out of Japanese screens , and who were playing in the midst of short-legged poodles and yellowish cats , might have been gathered .  The streets were crowded with people .  Priests were passing in processions , beating their dreary tambourines; police and custom-house officers with pointed hats encrusted with lac and carrying two sabres hung to their waists; soldiers , clad in blue cotton with white stripes , and bearing guns; the Mikados guards , enveloped in silken doubles , hauberks and coats of mail; and numbers of military folk of all ranks--for the military profession is as much respected in Japan as it is despised in China--went hither and thither in groups and pairs . Passepartout saw , too , begging friars , long-robed pilgrims , and simple civilians , with their warped and jet-black hair , big heads , long busts , slender legs , short stature , and complexions varying from copper-colour to a dead white , but never yellow , like the Chinese , from whom the Japanese widely differ .  He did not fail to observe the curious equipages--carriages and palanquins , barrows supplied with sails , and litters made of bamboo; nor the women--whom he thought not especially handsome--who took little steps with their little feet , whereon they wore canvas shoes , straw sandals , and clogs of worked wood , and who displayed tight-looking eyes , flat chests , teeth fashionably blackened , and gowns crossed with silken scarfs , tied in an enormous knot behind an ornament which the modern Parisian ladies seem to have borrowed from the dames of Japan .  Passepartout wandered for several hours in the midst of this motley crowd , looking in at the windows of the rich and curious shops , the jewellery establishments glittering with quaint Japanese ornaments , the restaurants decked with streamers and banners , the tea-houses , where the odorous beverage was being drunk with saki , a liquor concocted from the fermentation of rice , and the comfortable smoking-houses , where they were puffing , not opium , which is almost unknown in Japan , but a very fine , stringy tobacco .  He went on till he found himself in the fields , in the midst of vast rice plantations .  There he saw dazzling camellias expanding themselves , with flowers which were giving forth their last colours and perfumes , not on bushes , but on trees , and within bamboo enclosures , cherry , plum , and apple trees , which the Japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit , and which queerly-fashioned , grinning scarecrows protected from the sparrows , pigeons , ravens , and other voracious birds .  On the branches of the cedars were perched large eagles; amid the foliage of the weeping willows were herons , solemnly standing on one leg; and on every hand were crows , ducks , hawks , wild birds , and a multitude of cranes , which the Japanese consider sacred , and which to their minds symbolise long life and prosperity .  As he was strolling along , Passepartout espied some violets among the shrubs .  Good! said he; Ill have some supper .  But , on smelling them , he found that they were odourless .  No chance there , thought he .  The worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the Carnatic; but , as he had been walking about all day , the demands of hunger were becoming importunate . He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton , goat , nor pork; and , knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle , which are preserved solely for farming , he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in Yokohama--nor was he mistaken; and , in default of butchers meat , he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer , a partridge , or some quails , some game or fish , which , with rice , the Japanese eat almost exclusively .  But he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart , and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning .  Night came , and Passepartout re-entered the native quarter , where he wandered through the streets , lit by vari-coloured lanterns , looking on at the dancers , who were executing skilful steps and boundings , and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes .  Then he came to the harbour , which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen , who were fishing from their boats .  The streets at last became quiet , and the patrol , the officers of which , in their splendid costumes , and surrounded by their suites , Passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors , succeeded the bustling crowd .  Each time a company passed , Passepartout chuckled , and said to himself: Good! another Japanese embassy departing for Europe!     Chapter XXIII  IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUTS NOSE BECOMES OUTRAGEOUSLY LONG   The next morning poor , jaded , famished Passepartout said to himself that he must get something to eat at all hazards , and the sooner he did so the better .  He might , indeed , sell his watch; but he would have starved first .  Now or never he must use the strong , if not melodious voice which nature had bestowed upon him .  He knew several French and English songs , and resolved to try them upon the Japanese , who must be lovers of music , since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals , tam-tams , and tambourines , and could not but appreciate European talent .  It was , perhaps , rather early in the morning to get up a concert , and the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbers , might not possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing the Mikados features . Passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours; and , as he was sauntering along , it occurred to him that he would seem rather too well dressed for a wandering artist .  The idea struck him to change his garments for clothes more in harmony with his project; by which he might also get a little money to satisfy the immediate cravings of hunger .  The resolution taken , it remained to carry it out .  It was only after a long search that Passepartout discovered a native dealer in old clothes , to whom he applied for an exchange .  The man liked the European costume , and ere long Passepartout issued from his shop accoutred in an old Japanese coat , and a sort of one-sided turban , faded with long use .  A few small pieces of silver , moreover , jingled in his pocket .  Good! thought he .  I will imagine I am at the Carnival!  His first care , after being thus Japanesed , was to enter a tea-house of modest appearance , and , upon half a bird and a little rice , to breakfast like a man for whom dinner was as yet a problem to be solved .  Now , thought he , when he had eaten heartily , I mustnt lose my head . I cant sell this costume again for one still more Japanese .  I must consider how to leave this country of the Sun , of which I shall not retain the most delightful of memories , as quickly as possible .  It occurred to him to visit the steamers which were about to leave for America .  He would offer himself as a cook or servant , in payment of his passage and meals .  Once at San Francisco , he would find some means of going on .  The difficulty was , how to traverse the four thousand seven hundred miles of the Pacific which lay between Japan and the New World .  Passepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging , and directed his steps towards the docks .  But , as he approached them , his project , which at first had seemed so simple , began to grow more and more formidable to his mind .  What need would they have of a cook or servant on an American steamer , and what confidence would they put in him , dressed as he was ?  What references could he give ?  As he was reflecting in this wise , his eyes fell upon an immense placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets .  This placard , which was in English , read as follows:            ACROBATIC JAPANESE TROUPE ,    HONOURABLE WILLIAM BATULCAR , PROPRIETOR ,            LAST REPRESENTATIONS , PRIOR TO THEIR DEPARTURE TO THE UNITED STATES ,                   OF THE         LONG NOSES!   LONG NOSES! UNDER THE DIRECT PATRONAGE OF THE GOD TINGOU!            GREAT ATTRACTION!  The United States! said Passepartout; thats just what I want!  He followed the clown , and soon found himself once more in the Japanese quarter .  A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin , adorned with several clusters of streamers , the exterior walls of which were designed to represent , in violent colours and without perspective , a company of jugglers .  This was the Honourable William Batulcars establishment .  That gentleman was a sort of Barnum , the director of a troupe of mountebanks , jugglers , clowns , acrobats , equilibrists , and gymnasts , who , according to the placard , was giving his last performances before leaving the Empire of the Sun for the States of the Union .  Passepartout entered and asked for Mr . Batulcar , who straightway appeared in person .  What do you want ? said he to Passepartout , whom he at first took for a native .  Would you like a servant , sir ? asked Passepartout .  A servant! cried Mr . Batulcar , caressing the thick grey beard which hung from his chin .  I already have two who are obedient and faithful , have never left me , and serve me for their nourishment and here they are , added he , holding out his two robust arms , furrowed with veins as large as the strings of a bass-viol .  So I can be of no use to you ?  None .  The devil!  I should so like to cross the Pacific with you!  Ah! said the Honourable Mr . Batulcar .  You are no more a Japanese than I am a monkey!  Who are you dressed up in that way ?  A man dresses as he can .  Thats true .  You are a Frenchman , arent you ?  Yes; a Parisian of Paris .  Then you ought to know how to make grimaces ?  Why , replied Passepartout , a little vexed that his nationality should cause this question , we Frenchmen know how to make grimaces , it is true but not any better than the Americans do .  True .  Well , if I cant take you as a servant , I can as a clown .  You see , my friend , in France they exhibit foreign clowns , and in foreign parts French clowns .  Ah!  You are pretty strong , eh ?  Especially after a good meal .  And you can sing ?  Yes , returned Passepartout , who had formerly been wont to sing in the streets .  But can you sing standing on your head , with a top spinning on your left foot , and a sabre balanced on your right ?  Humph!  I think so , replied Passepartout , recalling the exercises of his younger days .  Well , thats enough , said the Honourable William Batulcar .  The engagement was concluded there and then .  Passepartout had at last found something to do .  He was engaged to act in the celebrated Japanese troupe .  It was not a very dignified position , but within a week he would be on his way to San Francisco .  The performance , so noisily announced by the Honourable Mr . Batulcar , was to commence at three oclock , and soon the deafening instruments of a Japanese orchestra resounded at the door .  Passepartout , though he had not been able to study or rehearse a part , was designated to lend the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the human pyramid , executed by the Long Noses of the god Tingou .  This great attraction was to close the performance .  Before three oclock the large shed was invaded by the spectators , comprising Europeans and natives , Chinese and Japanese , men , women and children , who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into the boxes opposite the stage .  The musicians took up a position inside , and were vigorously performing on their gongs , tam-tams , flutes , bones , tambourines , and immense drums .  The performance was much like all acrobatic displays; but it must be confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world .  One , with a fan and some bits of paper , performed the graceful trick of the butterflies and the flowers; another traced in the air , with the odorous smoke of his pipe , a series of blue words , which composed a compliment to the audience; while a third juggled with some lighted candles , which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips , and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling . Another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top; in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of their own in their interminable whirling; they ran over pipe-stems , the edges of sabres , wires and even hairs stretched across the stage; they turned around on the edges of large glasses , crossed bamboo ladders , dispersed into all the corners , and produced strange musical effects by the combination of their various pitches of tone .  The jugglers tossed them in the air , threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores , and yet they kept on spinning; they put them into their pockets , and took them out still whirling as before .  It is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats and gymnasts .  The turning on ladders , poles , balls , barrels , &c . , was executed with wonderful precision .  But the principal attraction was the exhibition of the Long Noses , a show to which Europe is as yet a stranger .  The Long Noses form a peculiar company , under the direct patronage of the god Tingou .  Attired after the fashion of the Middle Ages , they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings; but what especially distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their faces , and the uses which they made of them .  These noses were made of bamboo , and were five , six , and even ten feet long , some straight , others curved , some ribboned , and some having imitation warts upon them .  It was upon these appendages , fixed tightly on their real noses , that they performed their gymnastic exercises .  A dozen of these sectaries of Tingou lay flat upon their backs , while others , dressed to represent lightning-rods , came and frolicked on their noses , jumping from one to another , and performing the most skilful leapings and somersaults .  As a last scene , a human pyramid had been announced , in which fifty Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut .  But , instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each others shoulders , the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses .  It happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the base of the Car had quitted the troupe , and as , to fill this part , only strength and adroitness were necessary , Passepartout had been chosen to take his place .  The poor fellow really felt sad when--melancholy reminiscence of his youth!--he donned his costume , adorned with vari-coloured wings , and fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long .  But he cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to eat .  He went upon the stage , and took his place beside the rest who were to compose the base of the Car of Juggernaut .  They all stretched themselves on the floor , their noses pointing to the ceiling .  A second group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages , then a third above these , then a fourth , until a human monument reaching to the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses .  This elicited loud applause , in the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening air , when the pyramid tottered , the balance was lost , one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid , and the human monument was shattered like a castle built of cards!  It was Passepartouts fault .  Abandoning his position , clearing the footlights without the aid of his wings , and , clambering up to the right-hand gallery , he fell at the feet of one of the spectators , crying , Ah , my master! my master!  You here ?  Myself .  Very well; then let us go to the steamer , young man!  Mr . Fogg , Aouda , and Passepartout passed through the lobby of the theatre to the outside , where they encountered the Honourable Mr . Batulcar , furious with rage .  He demanded damages for the breakage of the pyramid; and Phileas Fogg appeased him by giving him a handful of banknotes .  At half-past six , the very hour of departure , Mr . Fogg and Aouda , followed by Passepartout , who in his hurry had retained his wings , and nose six feet long , stepped upon the American steamer .     Chapter XXIV  DURING WHICH MR . FOGG AND PARTY CROSS THE PACIFIC OCEAN   What happened when the pilot-boat came in sight of Shanghai will be easily guessed .  The signals made by the Tankadere had been seen by the captain of the Yokohama steamer , who , espying the flag at half-mast , had directed his course towards the little craft .  Phileas Fogg , after paying the stipulated price of his passage to John Busby , and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and fifty pounds , ascended the steamer with Aouda and Fix; and they started at once for Nagasaki and Yokohama .  They reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of November . Phileas Fogg lost no time in going on board the Carnatic , where he learned , to Aoudas great delight--and perhaps to his own , though he betrayed no emotion--that Passepartout , a Frenchman , had really arrived on her the day before .  The San Francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening , and it became necessary to find Passepartout , if possible , without delay . Mr . Fogg applied in vain to the French and English consuls , and , after wandering through the streets a long time , began to despair of finding his missing servant .  Chance , or perhaps a kind of presentiment , at last led him into the Honourable Mr . Batulcars theatre .  He certainly would not have recognised Passepartout in the eccentric mountebanks costume; but the latter , lying on his back , perceived his master in the gallery .  He could not help starting , which so changed the position of his nose as to bring the pyramid pell-mell upon the stage .  All this Passepartout learned from Aouda , who recounted to him what had taken place on the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the Tankadere , in company with one Mr . Fix .  Passepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name .  He thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his master what had taken place between the detective and himself; and , in the account he gave of his absence , he simply excused himself for having been overtaken by drunkenness , in smoking opium at a tavern in Hong Kong .  Mr . Fogg heard this narrative coldly , without a word; and then furnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more in harmony with his position .  Within an hour the Frenchman had cut off his nose and parted with his wings , and retained nothing about him which recalled the sectary of the god Tingou .  The steamer which was about to depart from Yokohama to San Francisco belonged to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company , and was named the General Grant .  She was a large paddle-wheel steamer of two thousand five hundred tons; well equipped and very fast .  The massive walking-beam rose and fell above the deck; at one end a piston-rod worked up and down; and at the other was a connecting-rod which , in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one , was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles .  The General Grant was rigged with three masts , giving a large capacity for sails , and thus materially aiding the steam power .  By making twelve miles an hour , she would cross the ocean in twenty-one days .  Phileas Fogg was therefore justified in hoping that he would reach San Francisco by the 2nd of December , New York by the 11th , and London on the 20th--thus gaining several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of December .  There was a full complement of passengers on board , among them English , many Americans , a large number of coolies on their way to California , and several East Indian officers , who were spending their vacation in making the tour of the world .  Nothing of moment happened on the voyage; the steamer , sustained on its large paddles , rolled but little , and the Pacific almost justified its name .  Mr . Fogg was as calm and taciturn as ever .  His young companion felt herself more and more attached to him by other ties than gratitude; his silent but generous nature impressed her more than she thought; and it was almost unconsciously that she yielded to emotions which did not seem to have the least effect upon her protector .  Aouda took the keenest interest in his plans , and became impatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard his journey .  She often chatted with Passepartout , who did not fail to perceive the state of the ladys heart; and , being the most faithful of domestics , he never exhausted his eulogies of Phileas Foggs honesty , generosity , and devotion .  He took pains to calm Aoudas doubts of a successful termination of the journey , telling her that the most difficult part of it had passed , that now they were beyond the fantastic countries of Japan and China , and were fairly on their way to civilised places again .  A railway train from San Francisco to New York , and a transatlantic steamer from New York to Liverpool , would doubtless bring them to the end of this impossible journey round the world within the period agreed upon .  On the ninth day after leaving Yokohama , Phileas Fogg had traversed exactly one half of the terrestrial globe .  The General Grant passed , on the 23rd of November , the one hundred and eightieth meridian , and was at the very antipodes of London .  Mr . Fogg had , it is true , exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour , and there were only twenty-eight left .  But , though he was only half-way by the difference of meridians , he had really gone over two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from London to Aden , from Aden to Bombay , from Calcutta to Singapore , and from Singapore to Yokohama .  Could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel , which is that of London , the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles; whereas he would be forced , by the irregular methods of locomotion , to traverse twenty-six thousand , of which he had , on the 23rd of November , accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred .  And now the course was a straight one , and Fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way!  It happened also , on the 23rd of November , that Passepartout made a joyful discovery .  It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at London time , and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false and unreliable .  Now , on this day , though he had not changed the hands , he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ships chronometers . His triumph was hilarious .  He would have liked to know what Fix would say if he were aboard!  The rogue told me a lot of stories , repeated Passepartout , about the meridians , the sun , and the moon!  Moon , indeed!  moonshine more likely!  If one listened to that sort of people , a pretty sort of time one would keep!  I was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself by my watch!  Passepartout was ignorant that , if the face of his watch had been divided into twenty-four hours , like the Italian clocks , he would have no reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch would then , instead of as now indicating nine oclock in the morning , indicate nine oclock in the evening , that is , the twenty-first hour after midnight precisely the difference between London time and that of the one hundred and eightieth meridian .  But if Fix had been able to explain this purely physical effect , Passepartout would not have admitted , even if he had comprehended it .  Moreover , if the detective had been on board at that moment , Passepartout would have joined issue with him on a quite different subject , and in an entirely different manner .  Where was Fix at that moment ?  He was actually on board the General Grant .  On reaching Yokohama , the detective , leaving Mr . Fogg , whom he expected to meet again during the day , had repaired at once to the English consulate , where he at last found the warrant of arrest .  It had followed him from Bombay , and had come by the Carnatic , on which steamer he himself was supposed to be .  Fixs disappointment may be imagined when he reflected that the warrant was now useless .  Mr . Fogg had left English ground , and it was now necessary to procure his extradition!  Well , thought Fix , after a moment of anger , my warrant is not good here , but it will be in England .  The rogue evidently intends to return to his own country , thinking he has thrown the police off his track . Good!  I will follow him across the Atlantic .  As for the money , heaven grant there may be some left!  But the fellow has already spent in travelling , rewards , trials , bail , elephants , and all sorts of charges , more than five thousand pounds .  Yet , after all , the Bank is rich!  His course decided on , he went on board the General Grant , and was there when Mr . Fogg and Aouda arrived .  To his utter amazement , he recognised Passepartout , despite his theatrical disguise .  He quickly concealed himself in his cabin , to avoid an awkward explanation , and hoped--thanks to the number of passengers--to remain unperceived by Mr . Foggs servant .  On that very day , however , he met Passepartout face to face on the forward deck .  The latter , without a word , made a rush for him , grasped him by the throat , and , much to the amusement of a group of Americans , who immediately began to bet on him , administered to the detective a perfect volley of blows , which proved the great superiority of French over English pugilistic skill .  When Passepartout had finished , he found himself relieved and comforted .  Fix got up in a somewhat rumpled condition , and , looking at his adversary , coldly said , Have you done ?  For this time--yes .  Then let me have a word with you .  But I--  In your masters interests .  Passepartout seemed to be vanquished by Fixs coolness , for he quietly followed him , and they sat down aside from the rest of the passengers .  You have given me a thrashing , said Fix .  Good , I expected it .  Now , listen to me .  Up to this time I have been Mr . Foggs adversary .  I am now in his game .  Aha! cried Passepartout; you are convinced he is an honest man ?  No , replied Fix coldly , I think him a rascal .  Sh! dont budge , and let me speak .  As long as Mr . Fogg was on English ground , it was for my interest to detain him there until my warrant of arrest arrived .  I did everything I could to keep him back .  I sent the Bombay priests after him , I got you intoxicated at Hong Kong , I separated you from him , and I made him miss the Yokohama steamer .  Passepartout listened , with closed fists .  Now , resumed Fix , Mr . Fogg seems to be going back to England .  Well , I will follow him there .  But hereafter I will do as much to keep obstacles out of his way as I have done up to this time to put them in his path .  Ive changed my game , you see , and simply because it was for my interest to change it .  Your interest is the same as mine; for it is only in England that you will ascertain whether you are in the service of a criminal or an honest man .  Passepartout listened very attentively to Fix , and was convinced that he spoke with entire good faith .  Are we friends ? asked the detective .  Friends ?--no , replied Passepartout; but allies , perhaps .  At the least sign of treason , however , Ill twist your neck for you .  Agreed , said the detective quietly .  Eleven days later , on the 3rd of December , the General Grant entered the bay of the Golden Gate , and reached San Francisco .  Mr . Fogg had neither gained nor lost a single day .     Chapter XXV  IN WHICH A SLIGHT GLIMPSE IS HAD OF SAN FRANCISCO   It was seven in the morning when Mr . Fogg , Aouda , and Passepartout set foot upon the American continent , if this name can be given to the floating quay upon which they disembarked .  These quays , rising and falling with the tide , thus facilitate the loading and unloading of vessels .  Alongside them were clippers of all sizes , steamers of all nationalities , and the steamboats , with several decks rising one above the other , which ply on the Sacramento and its tributaries .  There were also heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to Mexico , Chili , Peru , Brazil , Europe , Asia , and all the Pacific islands .  Passepartout , in his joy on reaching at last the American continent , thought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in fine style; but , tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks , he fell through them . Put out of countenance by the manner in which he thus set foot upon the New World , he uttered a loud cry , which so frightened the innumerable cormorants and pelicans that are always perched upon these movable quays , that they flew noisily away .  Mr . Fogg , on reaching shore , proceeded to find out at what hour the first train left for New York , and learned that this was at six oclock p .m .; he had , therefore , an entire day to spend in the Californian capital .  Taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars , he and Aouda entered it , while Passepartout mounted the box beside the driver , and they set out for the International Hotel .  From his exalted position Passepartout observed with much curiosity the wide streets , the low , evenly ranged houses , the Anglo-Saxon Gothic churches , the great docks , the palatial wooden and brick warehouses , the numerous conveyances , omnibuses , horse-cars , and upon the side-walks , not only Americans and Europeans , but Chinese and Indians . Passepartout was surprised at all he saw .  San Francisco was no longer the legendary city of 1849--a city of banditti , assassins , and incendiaries , who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder; a paradise of outlaws , where they gambled with gold-dust , a revolver in one hand and a bowie-knife in the other: it was now a great commercial emporium .  The lofty tower of its City Hall overlooked the whole panorama of the streets and avenues , which cut each other at right-angles , and in the midst of which appeared pleasant , verdant squares , while beyond appeared the Chinese quarter , seemingly imported from the Celestial Empire in a toy-box .  Sombreros and red shirts and plumed Indians were rarely to be seen; but there were silk hats and black coats everywhere worn by a multitude of nervously active , gentlemanly-looking men .  Some of the streets--especially Montgomery Street , which is to San Francisco what Regent Street is to London , the Boulevard des Italiens to Paris , and Broadway to New York--were lined with splendid and spacious stores , which exposed in their windows the products of the entire world .  When Passepartout reached the International Hotel , it did not seem to him as if he had left England at all .  The ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bar , a sort of restaurant freely open to all passers-by , who might partake of dried beef , oyster soup , biscuits , and cheese , without taking out their purses .  Payment was made only for the ale , porter , or sherry which was drunk .  This seemed very American to Passepartout .  The hotel refreshment-rooms were comfortable , and Mr . Fogg and Aouda , installing themselves at a table , were abundantly served on diminutive plates by negroes of darkest hue .  After breakfast , Mr . Fogg , accompanied by Aouda , started for the English consulate to have his passport visaed .  As he was going out , he met Passepartout , who asked him if it would not be well , before taking the train , to purchase some dozens of Enfield rifles and Colts revolvers .  He had been listening to stories of attacks upon the trains by the Sioux and Pawnees .  Mr . Fogg thought it a useless precaution , but told him to do as he thought best , and went on to the consulate .  He had not proceeded two hundred steps , however , when , by the greatest chance in the world , he met Fix .  The detective seemed wholly taken by surprise .  What!  Had Mr . Fogg and himself crossed the Pacific together , and not met on the steamer!  At least Fix felt honoured to behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much , and , as his business recalled him to Europe , he should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company .  Mr . Fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective--who was determined not to lose sight of him--begged permission to accompany them in their walk about San Francisco--a request which Mr . Fogg readily granted .  They soon found themselves in Montgomery Street , where a great crowd was collected; the side-walks , street , horsecar rails , the shop-doors , the windows of the houses , and even the roofs , were full of people . Men were going about carrying large posters , and flags and streamers were floating in the wind; while loud cries were heard on every hand .  Hurrah for Camerfield!  Hurrah for Mandiboy!  It was a political meeting; at least so Fix conjectured , who said to Mr . Fogg , Perhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd .  There may be danger in it .  Yes , returned Mr . Fogg; and blows , even if they are political are still blows .  Fix smiled at this remark; and , in order to be able to see without being jostled about , the party took up a position on the top of a flight of steps situated at the upper end of Montgomery Street . Opposite them , on the other side of the street , between a coal wharf and a petroleum warehouse , a large platform had been erected in the open air , towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed .  For what purpose was this meeting ?  What was the occasion of this excited assemblage ?  Phileas Fogg could not imagine .  Was it to nominate some high official--a governor or member of Congress ?  It was not improbable , so agitated was the multitude before them .  Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass .  All the hands were raised in the air .  Some , tightly closed , seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries--an energetic way , no doubt , of casting a vote .  The crowd swayed back , the banners and flags wavered , disappeared an instant , then reappeared in tatters .  The undulations of the human surge reached the steps , while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall .  Many of the black hats disappeared , and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height .  It is evidently a meeting , said Fix , and its object must be an exciting one .  I should not wonder if it were about the Alabama , despite the fact that that question is settled .  Perhaps , replied Mr . Fogg , simply .  At least , there are two champions in presence of each other , the Honourable Mr . Camerfield and the Honourable Mr . Mandiboy .  Aouda , leaning upon Mr . Foggs arm , observed the tumultuous scene with surprise , while Fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was . Before the man could reply , a fresh agitation arose; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons; and fists flew about in every direction .  Thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd .  Boots and shoes went whirling through the air , and Mr . Fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din , the rout approached the stairway , and flowed over the lower step .  One of the parties had evidently been repulsed; but the mere lookers-on could not tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had gained the upper hand .  It would be prudent for us to retire , said Fix , who was anxious that Mr . Fogg should not receive any injury , at least until they got back to London .  If there is any question about England in all this , and we were recognised , I fear it would go hard with us .  An English subject-- began Mr . Fogg .  He did not finish his sentence; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood , and there were frantic shouts of , Hurrah for Mandiboy!  Hip , hip , hurrah!  It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies , and taking the Camerfield forces in flank .  Mr . Fogg , Aouda , and Fix found themselves between two fires; it was too late to escape .  The torrent of men , armed with loaded canes and sticks , was irresistible .  Phileas Fogg and Fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to protect their fair companion; the former , as cool as ever , tried to defend himself with the weapons which nature has placed at the end of every Englishmans arm , but in vain .  A big brawny fellow with a red beard , flushed face , and broad shoulders , who seemed to be the chief of the band , raised his clenched fist to strike Mr . Fogg , whom he would have given a crushing blow , had not Fix rushed in and received it in his stead .  An enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the detectives silk hat , which was completely smashed in .  Yankee! exclaimed Mr . Fogg , darting a contemptuous look at the ruffian .  Englishman! returned the other .  We will meet again!  When you please .  What is your name ?  Phileas Fogg .  And yours ?  Colonel Stamp Proctor .  The human tide now swept by , after overturning Fix , who speedily got upon his feet again , though with tattered clothes .  Happily , he was not seriously hurt .  His travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal parts , and his trousers resembled those of certain Indians , which fit less compactly than they are easy to put on .  Aouda had escaped unharmed , and Fix alone bore marks of the fray in his black and blue bruise .  Thanks , said Mr . Fogg to the detective , as soon as they were out of the crowd .  No thanks are necessary , replied .  Fix; but let us go .  Where ?  To a tailors .  Such a visit was , indeed , opportune .  The clothing of both Mr . Fogg and Fix was in rags , as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the contest between Camerfield and Mandiboy .  An hour after , they were once more suitably attired , and with Aouda returned to the International Hotel .  Passepartout was waiting for his master , armed with half a dozen six-barrelled revolvers .  When he perceived Fix , he knit his brows; but Aouda having , in a few words , told him of their adventure , his countenance resumed its placid expression .  Fix evidently was no longer an enemy , but an ally; he was faithfully keeping his word .  Dinner over , the coach which was to convey the passengers and their luggage to the station drew up to the door .  As he was getting in , Mr . Fogg said to Fix , You have not seen this Colonel Proctor again ?  No .  I will come back to America to find him , said Phileas Fogg calmly . It would not be right for an Englishman to permit himself to be treated in that way , without retaliating .  The detective smiled , but did not reply .  It was clear that Mr . Fogg was one of those Englishmen who , while they do not tolerate duelling at home , fight abroad when their honour is attacked .  At a quarter before six the travellers reached the station , and found the train ready to depart .  As he was about to enter it , Mr . Fogg called a porter , and said to him: My friend , was there not some trouble to-day in San Francisco ?  It was a political meeting , sir , replied the porter .  But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets .  It was only a meeting assembled for an election .  The election of a general-in-chief , no doubt ? asked Mr . Fogg .  No , sir; of a justice of the peace .  Phileas Fogg got into the train , which started off at full speed .     Chapter XXVI  IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PARTY TRAVEL BY THE PACIFIC RAILROAD   From ocean to ocean--so say the Americans; and these four words compose the general designation of the great trunk line which crosses the entire width of the United States .  The Pacific Railroad is , however , really divided into two distinct lines: the Central Pacific , between San Francisco and Ogden , and the Union Pacific , between Ogden and Omaha .  Five main lines connect Omaha with New York .  New York and San Francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted metal ribbon , which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and eighty-six miles .  Between Omaha and the Pacific the railway crosses a territory which is still infested by Indians and wild beasts , and a large tract which the Mormons , after they were driven from Illinois in 1845 , began to colonise .  The journey from New York to San Francisco consumed , formerly , under the most favourable conditions , at least six months .  It is now accomplished in seven days .  It was in 1862 that , in spite of the Southern Members of Congress , who wished a more southerly route , it was decided to lay the road between the forty-first and forty-second parallels .  President Lincoln himself fixed the end of the line at Omaha , in Nebraska .  The work was at once commenced , and pursued with true American energy; nor did the rapidity with which it went on injuriously affect its good execution .  The road grew , on the prairies , a mile and a half a day .  A locomotive , running on the rails laid down the evening before , brought the rails to be laid on the morrow , and advanced upon them as fast as they were put in position .  The Pacific Railroad is joined by several branches in Iowa , Kansas , Colorado , and Oregon .  On leaving Omaha , it passes along the left bank of the Platte River as far as the junction of its northern branch , follows its southern branch , crosses the Laramie territory and the Wahsatch Mountains , turns the Great Salt Lake , and reaches Salt Lake City , the Mormon capital , plunges into the Tuilla Valley , across the American Desert , Cedar and Humboldt Mountains , the Sierra Nevada , and descends , via Sacramento , to the Pacific--its grade , even on the Rocky Mountains , never exceeding one hundred and twelve feet to the mile .  Such was the road to be traversed in seven days , which would enable Phileas Fogg--at least , so he hoped--to take the Atlantic steamer at New York on the 11th for Liverpool .  The car which he occupied was a sort of long omnibus on eight wheels , and with no compartments in the interior .  It was supplied with two rows of seats , perpendicular to the direction of the train on either side of an aisle which conducted to the front and rear platforms . These platforms were found throughout the train , and the passengers were able to pass from one end of the train to the other .  It was supplied with saloon cars , balcony cars , restaurants , and smoking-cars; theatre cars alone were wanting , and they will have these some day .  Book and news dealers , sellers of edibles , drinkables , and cigars , who seemed to have plenty of customers , were continually circulating in the aisles .  The train left Oakland station at six oclock .  It was already night , cold and cheerless , the heavens being overcast with clouds which seemed to threaten snow .  The train did not proceed rapidly; counting the stoppages , it did not run more than twenty miles an hour , which was a sufficient speed , however , to enable it to reach Omaha within its designated time .  There was but little conversation in the car , and soon many of the passengers were overcome with sleep .  Passepartout found himself beside the detective; but he did not talk to him .  After recent events , their relations with each other had grown somewhat cold; there could no longer be mutual sympathy or intimacy between them .  Fixs manner had not changed; but Passepartout was very reserved , and ready to strangle his former friend on the slightest provocation .  Snow began to fall an hour after they started , a fine snow , however , which happily could not obstruct the train; nothing could be seen from the windows but a vast , white sheet , against which the smoke of the locomotive had a greyish aspect .  At eight oclock a steward entered the car and announced that the time for going to bed had arrived; and in a few minutes the car was transformed into a dormitory .  The backs of the seats were thrown back , bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out by an ingenious system , berths were suddenly improvised , and each traveller had soon at his disposition a comfortable bed , protected from curious eyes by thick curtains .  The sheets were clean and the pillows soft .  It only remained to go to bed and sleep which everybody did--while the train sped on across the State of California .  The country between San Francisco and Sacramento is not very hilly . The Central Pacific , taking Sacramento for its starting-point , extends eastward to meet the road from Omaha .  The line from San Francisco to Sacramento runs in a north-easterly direction , along the American River , which empties into San Pablo Bay .  The one hundred and twenty miles between these cities were accomplished in six hours , and towards midnight , while fast asleep , the travellers passed through Sacramento; so that they saw nothing of that important place , the seat of the State government , with its fine quays , its broad streets , its noble hotels , squares , and churches .  The train , on leaving Sacramento , and passing the junction , Roclin , Auburn , and Colfax , entered the range of the Sierra Nevada .  Cisco was reached at seven in the morning; and an hour later the dormitory was transformed into an ordinary car , and the travellers could observe the picturesque beauties of the mountain region through which they were steaming .  The railway track wound in and out among the passes , now approaching the mountain-sides , now suspended over precipices , avoiding abrupt angles by bold curves , plunging into narrow defiles , which seemed to have no outlet .  The locomotive , its great funnel emitting a weird light , with its sharp bell , and its cow-catcher extended like a spur , mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascades , and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines .  There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route .  The railway turned around the sides of the mountains , and did not attempt to violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to another .  The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson Valley about nine oclock , going always northeasterly; and at midday reached Reno , where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast .  From this point the road , running along Humboldt River , passed northward for several miles by its banks; then it turned eastward , and kept by the river until it reached the Humboldt Range , nearly at the extreme eastern limit of Nevada .  Having breakfasted , Mr . Fogg and his companions resumed their places in the car , and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along the vast prairies , the mountains lining the horizon , and the creeks , with their frothy , foaming streams .  Sometimes a great herd of buffaloes , massing together in the distance , seemed like a moveable dam .  These innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together , in compact ranks .  The locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear .  This happened , indeed , to the train in which Mr . Fogg was travelling . About twelve oclock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track .  The locomotive , slackening its speed , tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too great .  The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait , uttering now and then deafening bellowings .  There was no use of interrupting them , for , having taken a particular direction , nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain .  The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg , who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry , remained in his seat , and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way .  Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned , and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them .  What a country! cried he .  Mere cattle stop the trains , and go by in a procession , just as if they were not impeding travel!  Parbleu!  I should like to know if Mr . Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And heres an engineer who doesnt dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!  The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle , and he was wise .  He would have crushed the first buffaloes , no doubt , with the cow-catcher; but the locomotive , however powerful , would soon have been checked , the train would inevitably have been thrown off the track , and would then have been helpless .  The best course was to wait patiently , and regain the lost time by greater speed when the obstacle was removed .  The procession of buffaloes lasted three full hours , and it was night before the track was clear .  The last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails , while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon .  It was eight oclock when the train passed through the defiles of the Humboldt Range , and half-past nine when it penetrated Utah , the region of the Great Salt Lake , the singular colony of the Mormons .     Chapter XXVII  IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT UNDERGOES , AT A SPEED OF TWENTY MILES AN HOUR , A COURSE OF MORMON HISTORY   During the night of the 5th of December , the train ran south-easterly for about fifty miles; then rose an equal distance in a north-easterly direction , towards the Great Salt Lake .  Passepartout , about nine oclock , went out upon the platform to take the air .  The weather was cold , the heavens grey , but it was not snowing .  The suns disc , enlarged by the mist , seemed an enormous ring of gold , and Passepartout was amusing himself by calculating its value in pounds sterling , when he was diverted from this interesting study by a strange-looking personage who made his appearance on the platform .  This personage , who had taken the train at Elko , was tall and dark , with black moustache , black stockings , a black silk hat , a black waistcoat , black trousers , a white cravat , and dogskin gloves .  He might have been taken for a clergyman .  He went from one end of the train to the other , and affixed to the door of each car a notice written in manuscript .  Passepartout approached and read one of these notices , which stated that Elder William Hitch , Mormon missionary , taking advantage of his presence on train No . 48 , would deliver a lecture on Mormonism in car No . 117 , from eleven to twelve oclock; and that he invited all who were desirous of being instructed concerning the mysteries of the religion of the Latter Day Saints to attend .  Ill go , said Passepartout to himself .  He knew nothing of Mormonism except the custom of polygamy , which is its foundation .  The news quickly spread through the train , which contained about one hundred passengers , thirty of whom , at most , attracted by the notice , ensconced themselves in car No . 117 .  Passepartout took one of the front seats .  Neither Mr . Fogg nor Fix cared to attend .  At the appointed hour Elder William Hitch rose , and , in an irritated voice , as if he had already been contradicted , said , I tell you that Joe Smith is a martyr , that his brother Hiram is a martyr , and that the persecutions of the United States Government against the prophets will also make a martyr of Brigham Young .  Who dares to say the contrary ?  No one ventured to gainsay the missionary , whose excited tone contrasted curiously with his naturally calm visage .  No doubt his anger arose from the hardships to which the Mormons were actually subjected .  The government had just succeeded , with some difficulty , in reducing these independent fanatics to its rule .  It had made itself master of Utah , and subjected that territory to the laws of the Union , after imprisoning Brigham Young on a charge of rebellion and polygamy . The disciples of the prophet had since redoubled their efforts , and resisted , by words at least , the authority of Congress .  Elder Hitch , as is seen , was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains .  Then , emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures , he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical times: how that , in Israel , a Mormon prophet of the tribe of Joseph published the annals of the new religion , and bequeathed them to his son Mormon; how , many centuries later , a translation of this precious book , which was written in Egyptian , was made by Joseph Smith , junior , a Vermont farmer , who revealed himself as a mystical prophet in 1825; and how , in short , the celestial messenger appeared to him in an illuminated forest , and gave him the annals of the Lord .  Several of the audience , not being much interested in the missionarys narrative , here left the car; but Elder Hitch , continuing his lecture , related how Smith , junior , with his father , two brothers , and a few disciples , founded the church of the Latter Day Saints , which , adopted not only in America , but in England , Norway and Sweden , and Germany , counts many artisans , as well as men engaged in the liberal professions , among its members; how a colony was established in Ohio , a temple erected there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars , and a town built at Kirkland; how Smith became an enterprising banker , and received from a simple mummy showman a papyrus scroll written by Abraham and several famous Egyptians .  The Elders story became somewhat wearisome , and his audience grew gradually less , until it was reduced to twenty passengers .  But this did not disconcert the enthusiast , who proceeded with the story of Joseph Smiths bankruptcy in 1837 , and how his ruined creditors gave him a coat of tar and feathers; his reappearance some years afterwards , more honourable and honoured than ever , at Independence , Missouri , the chief of a flourishing colony of three thousand disciples , and his pursuit thence by outraged Gentiles , and retirement into the Far West .  Ten hearers only were now left , among them honest Passepartout , who was listening with all his ears .  Thus he learned that , after long persecutions , Smith reappeared in Illinois , and in 1839 founded a community at Nauvoo , on the Mississippi , numbering twenty-five thousand souls , of which he became mayor , chief justice , and general-in-chief; that he announced himself , in 1843 , as a candidate for the Presidency of the United States; and that finally , being drawn into ambuscade at Carthage , he was thrown into prison , and assassinated by a band of men disguised in masks .  Passepartout was now the only person left in the car , and the Elder , looking him full in the face , reminded him that , two years after the assassination of Joseph Smith , the inspired prophet , Brigham Young , his successor , left Nauvoo for the banks of the Great Salt Lake , where , in the midst of that fertile region , directly on the route of the emigrants who crossed Utah on their way to California , the new colony , thanks to the polygamy practised by the Mormons , had flourished beyond expectations .  And this , added Elder William Hitch , this is why the jealousy of Congress has been aroused against us!  Why have the soldiers of the Union invaded the soil of Utah ?  Why has Brigham Young , our chief , been imprisoned , in contempt of all justice ?  Shall we yield to force ? Never!  Driven from Vermont , driven from Illinois , driven from Ohio , driven from Missouri , driven from Utah , we shall yet find some independent territory on which to plant our tents .  And you , my brother , continued the Elder , fixing his angry eyes upon his single auditor , will you not plant yours there , too , under the shadow of our flag ?  No! replied Passepartout courageously , in his turn retiring from the car , and leaving the Elder to preach to vacancy .  During the lecture the train had been making good progress , and towards half-past twelve it reached the northwest border of the Great Salt Lake .  Thence the passengers could observe the vast extent of this interior sea , which is also called the Dead Sea , and into which flows an American Jordan .  It is a picturesque expanse , framed in lofty crags in large strata , encrusted with white salt--a superb sheet of water , which was formerly of larger extent than now , its shores having encroached with the lapse of time , and thus at once reduced its breadth and increased its depth .  The Salt Lake , seventy miles long and thirty-five wide , is situated three miles eight hundred feet above the sea .  Quite different from Lake Asphaltite , whose depression is twelve hundred feet below the sea , it contains considerable salt , and one quarter of the weight of its water is solid matter , its specific weight being 1 ,170 , and , after being distilled , 1 ,000 .  Fishes are , of course , unable to live in it , and those which descend through the Jordan , the Weber , and other streams soon perish .  The country around the lake was well cultivated , for the Mormons are mostly farmers; while ranches and pens for domesticated animals , fields of wheat , corn , and other cereals , luxuriant prairies , hedges of wild rose , clumps of acacias and milk-wort , would have been seen six months later .  Now the ground was covered with a thin powdering of snow .  The train reached Ogden at two oclock , where it rested for six hours , Mr . Fogg and his party had time to pay a visit to Salt Lake City , connected with Ogden by a branch road; and they spent two hours in this strikingly American town , built on the pattern of other cities of the Union , like a checker-board , with the sombre sadness of right-angles , as Victor Hugo expresses it .  The founder of the City of the Saints could not escape from the taste for symmetry which distinguishes the Anglo-Saxons .  In this strange country , where the people are certainly not up to the level of their institutions , everything is done squarely--cities , houses , and follies .  The travellers , then , were promenading , at three oclock , about the streets of the town built between the banks of the Jordan and the spurs of the Wahsatch Range .  They saw few or no churches , but the prophets mansion , the court-house , and the arsenal , blue-brick houses with verandas and porches , surrounded by gardens bordered with acacias , palms , and locusts .  A clay and pebble wall , built in 1853 , surrounded the town; and in the principal street were the market and several hotels adorned with pavilions .  The place did not seem thickly populated .  The streets were almost deserted , except in the vicinity of the temple , which they only reached after having traversed several quarters surrounded by palisades .  There were many women , which was easily accounted for by the peculiar institution of the Mormons; but it must not be supposed that all the Mormons are polygamists .  They are free to marry or not , as they please; but it is worth noting that it is mainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry , as , according to the Mormon religion , maiden ladies are not admitted to the possession of its highest joys .  These poor creatures seemed to be neither well off nor happy .  Some--the more well-to-do , no doubt--wore short , open , black silk dresses , under a hood or modest shawl; others were habited in Indian fashion .  Passepartout could not behold without a certain fright these women , charged , in groups , with conferring happiness on a single Mormon .  His common sense pitied , above all , the husband .  It seemed to him a terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once across the vicissitudes of life , and to conduct them , as it were , in a body to the Mormon paradise with the prospect of seeing them in the company of the glorious Smith , who doubtless was the chief ornament of that delightful place , to all eternity .  He felt decidedly repelled from such a vocation , and he imagined--perhaps he was mistaken--that the fair ones of Salt Lake City cast rather alarming glances on his person .  Happily , his stay there was but brief .  At four the party found themselves again at the station , took their places in the train , and the whistle sounded for starting .  Just at the moment , however , that the locomotive wheels began to move , cries of Stop! stop! were heard .  Trains , like time and tide , stop for no one .  The gentleman who uttered the cries was evidently a belated Mormon .  He was breathless with running .  Happily for him , the station had neither gates nor barriers . He rushed along the track , jumped on the rear platform of the train , and fell , exhausted , into one of the seats .  Passepartout , who had been anxiously watching this amateur gymnast , approached him with lively interest , and learned that he had taken flight after an unpleasant domestic scene .  When the Mormon had recovered his breath , Passepartout ventured to ask him politely how many wives he had; for , from the manner in which he had decamped , it might be thought that he had twenty at least .  One , sir , replied the Mormon , raising his arms heavenward--one , and that was enough!     Chapter XXVIII  IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT DOES NOT SUCCEED IN MAKING ANYBODY LISTEN TO REASON   The train , on leaving Great Salt Lake at Ogden , passed northward for an hour as far as Weber River , having completed nearly nine hundred miles from San Francisco .  From this point it took an easterly direction towards the jagged Wahsatch Mountains .  It was in the section included between this range and the Rocky Mountains that the American engineers found the most formidable difficulties in laying the road , and that the government granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile , instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains . But the engineers , instead of violating nature , avoided its difficulties by winding around , instead of penetrating the rocks .  One tunnel only , fourteen thousand feet in length , was pierced in order to arrive at the great basin .  The track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at the Great Salt Lake .  From this point it described a long curve , descending towards Bitter Creek Valley , to rise again to the dividing ridge of the waters between the Atlantic and the Pacific .  There were many creeks in this mountainous region , and it was necessary to cross Muddy Creek , Green Creek , and others , upon culverts .  Passepartout grew more and more impatient as they went on , while Fix longed to get out of this difficult region , and was more anxious than Phileas Fogg himself to be beyond the danger of delays and accidents , and set foot on English soil .  At ten oclock at night the train stopped at Fort Bridger station , and twenty minutes later entered Wyoming Territory , following the valley of Bitter Creek throughout .  The next day , 7th December , they stopped for a quarter of an hour at Green River station .  Snow had fallen abundantly during the night , but , being mixed with rain , it had half melted , and did not interrupt their progress .  The bad weather , however , annoyed Passepartout; for the accumulation of snow , by blocking the wheels of the cars , would certainly have been fatal to Mr . Foggs tour .  What an idea! he said to himself .  Why did my master make this journey in winter ?  Couldnt he have waited for the good season to increase his chances ?  While the worthy Frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky and the depression of the temperature , Aouda was experiencing fears from a totally different cause .  Several passengers had got off at Green River , and were walking up and down the platforms; and among these Aouda recognised Colonel Stamp Proctor , the same who had so grossly insulted Phileas Fogg at the San Francisco meeting .  Not wishing to be recognised , the young woman drew back from the window , feeling much alarm at her discovery .  She was attached to the man who , however coldly , gave her daily evidences of the most absolute devotion .  She did not comprehend , perhaps , the depth of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her , which she called gratitude , but which , though she was unconscious of it , was really more than that .  Her heart sank within her when she recognised the man whom Mr . Fogg desired , sooner or later , to call to account for his conduct .  Chance alone , it was clear , had brought Colonel Proctor on this train; but there he was , and it was necessary , at all hazards , that Phileas Fogg should not perceive his adversary .  Aouda seized a moment when Mr . Fogg was asleep to tell Fix and Passepartout whom she had seen .  That Proctor on this train! cried Fix .  Well , reassure yourself , madam; before he settles with Mr . Fogg; he has got to deal with me!  It seems to me that I was the more insulted of the two .  And , besides , added Passepartout , Ill take charge of him , colonel as he is .  Mr . Fix , resumed Aouda , Mr . Fogg will allow no one to avenge him . He said that he would come back to America to find this man .  Should he perceive Colonel Proctor , we could not prevent a collision which might have terrible results .  He must not see him .  You are right , madam , replied Fix; a meeting between them might ruin all .  Whether he were victorious or beaten , Mr . Fogg would be delayed , and--  And , added Passepartout , that would play the game of the gentlemen of the Reform Club .  In four days we shall be in New York .  Well , if my master does not leave this car during those four days , we may hope that chance will not bring him face to face with this confounded American . We must , if possible , prevent his stirring out of it .  The conversation dropped .  Mr . Fogg had just woke up , and was looking out of the window .  Soon after Passepartout , without being heard by his master or Aouda , whispered to the detective , Would you really fight for him ?  I would do anything , replied Fix , in a tone which betrayed determined will , to get him back living to Europe!  Passepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his frame , but his confidence in his master remained unbroken .  Was there any means of detaining Mr . Fogg in the car , to avoid a meeting between him and the colonel ?  It ought not to be a difficult task , since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious . The detective , at least , seemed to have found a way; for , after a few moments , he said to Mr . Fogg , These are long and slow hours , sir , that we are passing on the railway .  Yes , replied Mr . Fogg; but they pass .  You were in the habit of playing whist , resumed Fix , on the steamers .  Yes; but it would be difficult to do so here .  I have neither cards nor partners .  Oh , but we can easily buy some cards , for they are sold on all the American trains .  And as for partners , if madam plays--  Certainly , sir , Aouda quickly replied; I understand whist .  It is part of an English education .  I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game .  Well , here are three of us , and a dummy--  As you please , sir , replied Phileas Fogg , heartily glad to resume his favourite pastime even on the railway .  Passepartout was dispatched in search of the steward , and soon returned with two packs of cards , some pins , counters , and a shelf covered with cloth .  The game commenced .  Aouda understood whist sufficiently well , and even received some compliments on her playing from Mr . Fogg .  As for the detective , he was simply an adept , and worthy of being matched against his present opponent .  Now , thought Passepartout , weve got him .  He wont budge .  At eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of the waters at Bridger Pass , seven thousand five hundred and twenty-four feet above the level of the sea , one of the highest points attained by the track in crossing the Rocky Mountains .  After going about two hundred miles , the travellers at last found themselves on one of those vast plains which extend to the Atlantic , and which nature has made so propitious for laying the iron road .  On the declivity of the Atlantic basin the first streams , branches of the North Platte River , already appeared .  The whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi-circular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains , the highest being Laramie Peak .  Between this and the railway extended vast plains , plentifully irrigated .  On the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the Arkansas River , one of the great tributaries of the Missouri .  At half-past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of Fort Halleck , which commands that section; and in a few more hours the Rocky Mountains were crossed .  There was reason to hope , then , that no accident would mark the journey through this difficult country .  The snow had ceased falling , and the air became crisp and cold .  Large birds , frightened by the locomotive , rose and flew off in the distance . No wild beast appeared on the plain .  It was a desert in its vast nakedness .  After a comfortable breakfast , served in the car , Mr . Fogg and his partners had just resumed whist , when a violent whistling was heard , and the train stopped .  Passepartout put his head out of the door , but saw nothing to cause the delay; no station was in view .  Aouda and Fix feared that Mr . Fogg might take it into his head to get out; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant , See what is the matter .  Passepartout rushed out of the car .  Thirty or forty passengers had already descended , amongst them Colonel Stamp Proctor .  The train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way .  The engineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signal-man , whom the station-master at Medicine Bow , the next stopping place , had sent on before .  The passengers drew around and took part in the discussion , in which Colonel Proctor , with his insolent manner , was conspicuous .  Passepartout , joining the group , heard the signal-man say , No! you cant pass .  The bridge at Medicine Bow is shaky , and would not bear the weight of the train .  This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids , about a mile from the place where they now were .  According to the signal-man , it was in a ruinous condition , several of the iron wires being broken; and it was impossible to risk the passage .  He did not in any way exaggerate the condition of the bridge .  It may be taken for granted that , rash as the Americans usually are , when they are prudent there is good reason for it .  Passepartout , not daring to apprise his master of what he heard , listened with set teeth , immovable as a statue .  Hum! cried Colonel Proctor; but we are not going to stay here , I imagine , and take root in the snow ?  Colonel , replied the conductor , we have telegraphed to Omaha for a train , but it is not likely that it will reach Medicine Bow in less than six hours .  Six hours! cried Passepartout .  Certainly , returned the conductor , besides , it will take us as long as that to reach Medicine Bow on foot .  But it is only a mile from here , said one of the passengers .  Yes , but its on the other side of the river .  And cant we cross that in a boat ? asked the colonel .  Thats impossible .  The creek is swelled by the rains .  It is a rapid , and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a ford .  The colonel launched a volley of oaths , denouncing the railway company and the conductor; and Passepartout , who was furious , was not disinclined to make common cause with him .  Here was an obstacle , indeed , which all his masters banknotes could not remove .  There was a general disappointment among the passengers , who , without reckoning the delay , saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles over a plain covered with snow .  They grumbled and protested , and would certainly have thus attracted Phileas Foggs attention if he had not been completely absorbed in his game .  Passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what had occurred , and , with hanging head , he was turning towards the car , when the engineer , a true Yankee , named Forster called out , Gentlemen , perhaps there is a way , after all , to get over .  On the bridge ? asked a passenger .  On the bridge .  With our train ?  With our train .  Passepartout stopped short , and eagerly listened to the engineer .  But the bridge is unsafe , urged the conductor .  No matter , replied Forster; I think that by putting on the very highest speed we might have a chance of getting over .  The devil! muttered Passepartout .  But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineers proposal , and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted , and found the plan a very feasible one .  He told stories about engineers leaping their trains over rivers without bridges , by putting on full steam; and many of those present avowed themselves of the engineers mind .  We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over , said one .  Eighty! ninety!  Passepartout was astounded , and , though ready to attempt anything to get over Medicine Creek , thought the experiment proposed a little too American .  Besides , thought he , theres a still more simple way , and it does not even occur to any of these people!  Sir , said he aloud to one of the passengers , the engineers plan seems to me a little dangerous , but--  Eighty chances! replied the passenger , turning his back on him .  I know it , said Passepartout , turning to another passenger , but a simple idea--  Ideas are no use , returned the American , shrugging his shoulders , as the engineer assures us that we can pass .  Doubtless , urged Passepartout , we can pass , but perhaps it would be more prudent--  What!  Prudent! cried Colonel Proctor , whom this word seemed to excite prodigiously .  At full speed , dont you see , at full speed!  I know--I see , repeated Passepartout; but it would be , if not more prudent , since that word displeases you , at least more natural--  Who!  What!  Whats the matter with this fellow ? cried several .  The poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself .  Are you afraid ? asked Colonel Proctor .  I afraid ?  Very well; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be as American as they!  All aboard! cried the conductor .  Yes , all aboard! repeated Passepartout , and immediately .  But they cant prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to cross the bridge on foot , and let the train come after!  But no one heard this sage reflection , nor would anyone have acknowledged its justice .  The passengers resumed their places in the cars .  Passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed .  The whist-players were quite absorbed in their game .  The locomotive whistled vigorously; the engineer , reversing the steam , backed the train for nearly a mile--retiring , like a jumper , in order to take a longer leap .  Then , with another whistle , he began to move forward; the train increased its speed , and soon its rapidity became frightful; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive; the piston worked up and down twenty strokes to the second .  They perceived that the whole train , rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour , hardly bore upon the rails at all .  And they passed over!  It was like a flash .  No one saw the bridge . The train leaped , so to speak , from one bank to the other , and the engineer could not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the station .  But scarcely had the train passed the river , when the bridge , completely ruined , fell with a crash into the rapids of Medicine Bow .     Chapter XXIX  IN WHICH CERTAIN INCIDENTS ARE NARRATED WHICH ARE ONLY TO BE MET WITH ON AMERICAN RAILROADS   The train pursued its course , that evening , without interruption , passing Fort Saunders , crossing Cheyne Pass , and reaching Evans Pass . The road here attained the highest elevation of the journey , eight thousand and ninety-two feet above the level of the sea .  The travellers had now only to descend to the Atlantic by limitless plains , levelled by nature .  A branch of the grand trunk led off southward to Denver , the capital of Colorado .  The country round about is rich in gold and silver , and more than fifty thousand inhabitants are already settled there .  Thirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over from San Francisco , in three days and three nights; four days and nights more would probably bring them to New York .  Phileas Fogg was not as yet behind-hand .  During the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left; Lodge Pole Creek ran parallel with the road , marking the boundary between the territories of Wyoming and Colorado .  They entered Nebraska at eleven , passed near Sedgwick , and touched at Julesburg , on the southern branch of the Platte River .  It was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated on the 23rd of October , 1867 , by the chief engineer , General Dodge .  Two powerful locomotives , carrying nine cars of invited guests , amongst whom was Thomas C . Durant , vice-president of the road , stopped at this point; cheers were given , the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indian battle , fireworks were let off , and the first number of the Railway Pioneer was printed by a press brought on the train .  Thus was celebrated the inauguration of this great railroad , a mighty instrument of progress and civilisation , thrown across the desert , and destined to link together cities and towns which do not yet exist .  The whistle of the locomotive , more powerful than Amphions lyre , was about to bid them rise from American soil .  Fort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning , and three hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching Omaha .  The road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch of the Platte River , on its left bank .  At nine the train stopped at the important town of North Platte , built between the two arms of the river , which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery , a large tributary , whose waters empty into the Missouri a little above Omaha .  The one hundred and first meridian was passed .  Mr . Fogg and his partners had resumed their game; no one--not even the dummy--complained of the length of the trip .  Fix had begun by winning several guineas , which he seemed likely to lose; but he showed himself a not less eager whist-player than Mr . Fogg .  During the morning , chance distinctly favoured that gentleman .  Trumps and honours were showered upon his hands .  Once , having resolved on a bold stroke , he was on the point of playing a spade , when a voice behind him said , I should play a diamond .  Mr . Fogg , Aouda , and Fix raised their heads , and beheld Colonel Proctor .  Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once .  Ah! its you , is it , Englishman ? cried the colonel; its you who are going to play a spade!  And who plays it , replied Phileas Fogg coolly , throwing down the ten of spades .  Well , it pleases me to have it diamonds , replied Colonel Proctor , in an insolent tone .  He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been played , adding , You dont understand anything about whist .  Perhaps I do , as well as another , said Phileas Fogg , rising .  You have only to try , son of John Bull , replied the colonel .  Aouda turned pale , and her blood ran cold .  She seized Mr . Foggs arm and gently pulled him back .  Passepartout was ready to pounce upon the American , who was staring insolently at his opponent .  But Fix got up , and , going to Colonel Proctor said , You forget that it is I with whom you have to deal , sir; for it was I whom you not only insulted , but struck!  Mr . Fix , said Mr . Fogg , pardon me , but this affair is mine , and mine only .  The colonel has again insulted me , by insisting that I should not play a spade , and he shall give me satisfaction for it .  When and where you will , replied the American , and with whatever weapon you choose .  Aouda in vain attempted to retain Mr . Fogg; as vainly did the detective endeavour to make the quarrel his .  Passepartout wished to throw the colonel out of the window , but a sign from his master checked him . Phileas Fogg left the car , and the American followed him upon the platform .  Sir , said Mr . Fogg to his adversary , I am in a great hurry to get back to Europe , and any delay whatever will be greatly to my disadvantage .  Well , whats that to me ? replied Colonel Proctor .  Sir , said Mr . Fogg , very politely , after our meeting at San Francisco , I determined to return to America and find you as soon as I had completed the business which called me to England .  Really!  Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence ?  Why not ten years hence ?  I say six months , returned Phileas Fogg; and I shall be at the place of meeting promptly .  All this is an evasion , cried Stamp Proctor .  Now or never!  Very good .  You are going to New York ?  No .  To Chicago ?  No .  To Omaha ?  What difference is it to you ?  Do you know Plum Creek ?  No , replied Mr . Fogg .  Its the next station .  The train will be there in an hour , and will stop there ten minutes .  In ten minutes several revolver-shots could be exchanged .  Very well , said Mr . Fogg .  I will stop at Plum Creek .  And I guess youll stay there too , added the American insolently .  Who knows ? replied Mr . Fogg , returning to the car as coolly as usual . He began to reassure Aouda , telling her that blusterers were never to be feared , and begged Fix to be his second at the approaching duel , a request which the detective could not refuse .  Mr . Fogg resumed the interrupted game with perfect calmness .  At eleven oclock the locomotives whistle announced that they were approaching Plum Creek station .  Mr . Fogg rose , and , followed by Fix , went out upon the platform .  Passepartout accompanied him , carrying a pair of revolvers .  Aouda remained in the car , as pale as death .  The door of the next car opened , and Colonel Proctor appeared on the platform , attended by a Yankee of his own stamp as his second .  But just as the combatants were about to step from the train , the conductor hurried up , and shouted , You cant get off , gentlemen!  Why not ? asked the colonel .  We are twenty minutes late , and we shall not stop .  But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman .  I am sorry , said the conductor; but we shall be off at once . Theres the bell ringing now .  The train started .  Im really very sorry , gentlemen , said the conductor .  Under any other circumstances I should have been happy to oblige you .  But , after all , as you have not had time to fight here , why not fight as we go along ?  That wouldnt be convenient , perhaps , for this gentleman , said the colonel , in a jeering tone .  It would be perfectly so , replied Phileas Fogg .  Well , we are really in America , thought Passepartout , and the conductor is a gentleman of the first order!  So muttering , he followed his master .  The two combatants , their seconds , and the conductor passed through the cars to the rear of the train .  The last car was only occupied by a dozen passengers , whom the conductor politely asked if they would not be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments , as two gentlemen had an affair of honour to settle .  The passengers granted the request with alacrity , and straightway disappeared on the platform .  The car , which was some fifty feet long , was very convenient for their purpose .  The adversaries might march on each other in the aisle , and fire at their ease .  Never was duel more easily arranged .  Mr . Fogg and Colonel Proctor , each provided with two six-barrelled revolvers , entered the car .  The seconds , remaining outside , shut them in .  They were to begin firing at the first whistle of the locomotive .  After an interval of two minutes , what remained of the two gentlemen would be taken from the car .  Nothing could be more simple .  Indeed , it was all so simple that Fix and Passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they would crack . They were listening for the whistle agreed upon , when suddenly savage cries resounded in the air , accompanied by reports which certainly did not issue from the car where the duellists were .  The reports continued in front and the whole length of the train .  Cries of terror proceeded from the interior of the cars .  Colonel Proctor and Mr . Fogg , revolvers in hand , hastily quitted their prison , and rushed forward where the noise was most clamorous .  They then perceived that the train was attacked by a band of Sioux .  This was not the first attempt of these daring Indians , for more than once they had waylaid trains on the road .  A hundred of them had , according to their habit , jumped upon the steps without stopping the train , with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at full gallop .  The Sioux were armed with guns , from which came the reports , to which the passengers , who were almost all armed , responded by revolver-shots .  The Indians had first mounted the engine , and half stunned the engineer and stoker with blows from their muskets .  A Sioux chief , wishing to stop the train , but not knowing how to work the regulator , had opened wide instead of closing the steam-valve , and the locomotive was plunging forward with terrific velocity .  The Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars , skipping like enraged monkeys over the roofs , thrusting open the doors , and fighting hand to hand with the passengers .  Penetrating the baggage-car , they pillaged it , throwing the trunks out of the train .  The cries and shots were constant .  The travellers defended themselves bravely; some of the cars were barricaded , and sustained a siege , like moving forts , carried along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour .  Aouda behaved courageously from the first .  She defended herself like a true heroine with a revolver , which she shot through the broken windows whenever a savage made his appearance .  Twenty Sioux had fallen mortally wounded to the ground , and the wheels crushed those who fell upon the rails as if they had been worms .  Several passengers , shot or stunned , lay on the seats .  It was necessary to put an end to the struggle , which had lasted for ten minutes , and which would result in the triumph of the Sioux if the train was not stopped .  Fort Kearney station , where there was a garrison , was only two miles distant; but , that once passed , the Sioux would be masters of the train between Fort Kearney and the station beyond .  The conductor was fighting beside Mr . Fogg , when he was shot and fell . At the same moment he cried , Unless the train is stopped in five minutes , we are lost!  It shall be stopped , said Phileas Fogg , preparing to rush from the car .  Stay , monsieur , cried Passepartout; I will go .  Mr . Fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow , who , opening a door unperceived by the Indians , succeeded in slipping under the car; and while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each other over his head , he made use of his old acrobatic experience , and with amazing agility worked his way under the cars , holding on to the chains , aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes , creeping from one car to another with marvellous skill , and thus gaining the forward end of the train .  There , suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the tender , with the other he loosened the safety chains; but , owing to the traction , he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the yoking-bar , had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out .  The train , now detached from the engine , remained a little behind , whilst the locomotive rushed forward with increased speed .  Carried on by the force already acquired , the train still moved for several minutes; but the brakes were worked and at last they stopped , less than a hundred feet from Kearney station .  The soldiers of the fort , attracted by the shots , hurried up; the Sioux had not expected them , and decamped in a body before the train entirely stopped .  But when the passengers counted each other on the station platform several were found missing; among others the courageous Frenchman , whose devotion had just saved them .     Chapter XXX  IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SIMPLY DOES HIS DUTY   Three passengers including Passepartout had disappeared .  Had they been killed in the struggle ?  Were they taken prisoners by the Sioux ?  It was impossible to tell .  There were many wounded , but none mortally .  Colonel Proctor was one of the most seriously hurt; he had fought bravely , and a ball had entered his groin .  He was carried into the station with the other wounded passengers , to receive such attention as could be of avail .  Aouda was safe; and Phileas Fogg , who had been in the thickest of the fight , had not received a scratch .  Fix was slightly wounded in the arm .  But Passepartout was not to be found , and tears coursed down Aoudas cheeks .  All the passengers had got out of the train , the wheels of which were stained with blood .  From the tyres and spokes hung ragged pieces of flesh .  As far as the eye could reach on the white plain behind , red trails were visible .  The last Sioux were disappearing in the south , along the banks of Republican River .  Mr . Fogg , with folded arms , remained motionless .  He had a serious decision to make .  Aouda , standing near him , looked at him without speaking , and he understood her look .  If his servant was a prisoner , ought he not to risk everything to rescue him from the Indians ?  I will find him , living or dead , said he quietly to Aouda .  Ah , Mr .--Mr . Fogg! cried she , clasping his hands and covering them with tears .  Living , added Mr . Fogg , if we do not lose a moment .  Phileas Fogg , by this resolution , inevitably sacrificed himself; he pronounced his own doom .  The delay of a single day would make him lose the steamer at New York , and his bet would be certainly lost .  But as he thought , It is my duty , he did not hesitate .  The commanding officer of Fort Kearney was there .  A hundred of his soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend the station , should the Sioux attack it .  Sir , said Mr . Fogg to the captain , three passengers have disappeared .  Dead ? asked the captain .  Dead or prisoners; that is the uncertainty which must be solved .  Do you propose to pursue the Sioux ?  Thats a serious thing to do , sir , returned the captain .  These Indians may retreat beyond the Arkansas , and I cannot leave the fort unprotected .  The lives of three men are in question , sir , said Phileas Fogg .  Doubtless; but can I risk the lives of fifty men to save three ?  I dont know whether you can , sir; but you ought to do so .  Nobody here , returned the other , has a right to teach me my duty .  Very well , said Mr . Fogg , coldly .  I will go alone .  You , sir! cried Fix , coming up; you go alone in pursuit of the Indians ?  Would you have me leave this poor fellow to perish--him to whom every one present owes his life ?  I shall go .  No , sir , you shall not go alone , cried the captain , touched in spite of himself .  No! you are a brave man .  Thirty volunteers! he added , turning to the soldiers .  The whole company started forward at once .  The captain had only to pick his men .  Thirty were chosen , and an old sergeant placed at their head .  Thanks , captain , said Mr . Fogg .  Will you let me go with you ? asked Fix .  Do as you please , sir .  But if you wish to do me a favour , you will remain with Aouda .  In case anything should happen to me--  A sudden pallor overspread the detectives face .  Separate himself from the man whom he had so persistently followed step by step!  Leave him to wander about in this desert!  Fix gazed attentively at Mr . Fogg , and , despite his suspicions and of the struggle which was going on within him , he lowered his eyes before that calm and frank look .  I will stay , said he .  A few moments after , Mr . Fogg pressed the young womans hand , and , having confided to her his precious carpet-bag , went off with the sergeant and his little squad .  But , before going , he had said to the soldiers , My friends , I will divide five thousand dollars among you , if we save the prisoners .  It was then a little past noon .  Aouda retired to a waiting-room , and there she waited alone , thinking of the simple and noble generosity , the tranquil courage of Phileas Fogg .  He had sacrificed his fortune , and was now risking his life , all without hesitation , from duty , in silence .  Fix did not have the same thoughts , and could scarcely conceal his agitation .  He walked feverishly up and down the platform , but soon resumed his outward composure .  He now saw the folly of which he had been guilty in letting Fogg go alone .  What!  This man , whom he had just followed around the world , was permitted now to separate himself from him!  He began to accuse and abuse himself , and , as if he were director of police , administered to himself a sound lecture for his greenness .  I have been an idiot! he thought , and this man will see it .  He has gone , and wont come back!  But how is it that I , Fix , who have in my pocket a warrant for his arrest , have been so fascinated by him ? Decidedly , I am nothing but an ass!  So reasoned the detective , while the hours crept by all too slowly .  He did not know what to do .  Sometimes he was tempted to tell Aouda all; but he could not doubt how the young woman would receive his confidences .  What course should he take ?  He thought of pursuing Fogg across the vast white plains; it did not seem impossible that he might overtake him .  Footsteps were easily printed on the snow!  But soon , under a new sheet , every imprint would be effaced .  Fix became discouraged .  He felt a sort of insurmountable longing to abandon the game altogether .  He could now leave Fort Kearney station , and pursue his journey homeward in peace .  Towards two oclock in the afternoon , while it was snowing hard , long whistles were heard approaching from the east .  A great shadow , preceded by a wild light , slowly advanced , appearing still larger through the mist , which gave it a fantastic aspect .  No train was expected from the east , neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive; the train from Omaha to San Francisco was not due till the next day .  The mystery was soon explained .  The locomotive , which was slowly approaching with deafening whistles , was that which , having been detached from the train , had continued its route with such terrific rapidity , carrying off the unconscious engineer and stoker .  It had run several miles , when , the fire becoming low for want of fuel , the steam had slackened; and it had finally stopped an hour after , some twenty miles beyond Fort Kearney .  Neither the engineer nor the stoker was dead , and , after remaining for some time in their swoon , had come to themselves .  The train had then stopped .  The engineer , when he found himself in the desert , and the locomotive without cars , understood what had happened .  He could not imagine how the locomotive had become separated from the train; but he did not doubt that the train left behind was in distress .  He did not hesitate what to do .  It would be prudent to continue on to Omaha , for it would be dangerous to return to the train , which the Indians might still be engaged in pillaging .  Nevertheless , he began to rebuild the fire in the furnace; the pressure again mounted , and the locomotive returned , running backwards to Fort Kearney .  This it was which was whistling in the mist .  The travellers were glad to see the locomotive resume its place at the head of the train .  They could now continue the journey so terribly interrupted .  Aouda , on seeing the locomotive come up , hurried out of the station , and asked the conductor , Are you going to start ?  At once , madam .  But the prisoners , our unfortunate fellow-travellers--  I cannot interrupt the trip , replied the conductor .  We are already three hours behind time .  And when will another train pass here from San Francisco ?  To-morrow evening , madam .  To-morrow evening!  But then it will be too late!  We must wait--  It is impossible , responded the conductor .  If you wish to go , please get in .  I will not go , said Aouda .  Fix had heard this conversation .  A little while before , when there was no prospect of proceeding on the journey , he had made up his mind to leave Fort Kearney; but now that the train was there , ready to start , and he had only to take his seat in the car , an irresistible influence held him back .  The station platform burned his feet , and he could not stir .  The conflict in his mind again began; anger and failure stifled him .  He wished to struggle on to the end .  Meanwhile the passengers and some of the wounded , among them Colonel Proctor , whose injuries were serious , had taken their places in the train .  The buzzing of the over-heated boiler was heard , and the steam was escaping from the valves .  The engineer whistled , the train started , and soon disappeared , mingling its white smoke with the eddies of the densely falling snow .  The detective had remained behind .  Several hours passed .  The weather was dismal , and it was very cold . Fix sat motionless on a bench in the station; he might have been thought asleep .  Aouda , despite the storm , kept coming out of the waiting-room , going to the end of the platform , and peering through the tempest of snow , as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon around her , and to hear , if possible , some welcome sound .  She heard and saw nothing .  Then she would return , chilled through , to issue out again after the lapse of a few moments , but always in vain .  Evening came , and the little band had not returned .  Where could they be ?  Had they found the Indians , and were they having a conflict with them , or were they still wandering amid the mist ?  The commander of the fort was anxious , though he tried to conceal his apprehensions .  As night approached , the snow fell less plentifully , but it became intensely cold .  Absolute silence rested on the plains .  Neither flight of bird nor passing of beast troubled the perfect calm .  Throughout the night Aouda , full of sad forebodings , her heart stifled with anguish , wandered about on the verge of the plains .  Her imagination carried her far off , and showed her innumerable dangers . What she suffered through the long hours it would be impossible to describe .  Fix remained stationary in the same place , but did not sleep .  Once a man approached and spoke to him , and the detective merely replied by shaking his head .  Thus the night passed .  At dawn , the half-extinguished disc of the sun rose above a misty horizon; but it was now possible to recognise objects two miles off .  Phileas Fogg and the squad had gone southward; in the south all was still vacancy .  It was then seven oclock .  The captain , who was really alarmed , did not know what course to take .  Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first ?  Should he sacrifice more men , with so few chances of saving those already sacrificed ?  His hesitation did not last long , however .  Calling one of his lieutenants , he was on the point of ordering a reconnaissance , when gunshots were heard .  Was it a signal ?  The soldiers rushed out of the fort , and half a mile off they perceived a little band returning in good order .  Mr . Fogg was marching at their head , and just behind him were Passepartout and the other two travellers , rescued from the Sioux .  They had met and fought the Indians ten miles south of Fort Kearney . Shortly before the detachment arrived , Passepartout and his companions had begun to struggle with their captors , three of whom the Frenchman had felled with his fists , when his master and the soldiers hastened up to their relief .  All were welcomed with joyful cries .  Phileas Fogg distributed the reward he had promised to the soldiers , while Passepartout , not without reason , muttered to himself , It must certainly be confessed that I cost my master dear!  Fix , without saying a word , looked at Mr . Fogg , and it would have been difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within him .  As for Aouda , she took her protectors hand and pressed it in her own , too much moved to speak .  Meanwhile , Passepartout was looking about for the train; he thought he should find it there , ready to start for Omaha , and he hoped that the time lost might be regained .  The train! the train! cried he .  Gone , replied Fix .  And when does the next train pass here ? said Phileas Fogg .  Not till this evening .  Ah! returned the impassible gentleman quietly .     Chapter XXXI  IN WHICH FIX , THE DETECTIVE , CONSIDERABLY FURTHERS THE INTERESTS OF PHILEAS FOGG   Phileas Fogg found himself twenty hours behind time .  Passepartout , the involuntary cause of this delay , was desperate .  He had ruined his master!  At this moment the detective approached Mr . Fogg , and , looking him intently in the face , said:  Seriously , sir , are you in great haste ?  Quite seriously .  I have a purpose in asking , resumed Fix .  Is it absolutely necessary that you should be in New York on the 11th , before nine oclock in the evening , the time that the steamer leaves for Liverpool ?  It is absolutely necessary .  And , if your journey had not been interrupted by these Indians , you would have reached New York on the morning of the 11th ?  Yes; with eleven hours to spare before the steamer left .  Good! you are therefore twenty hours behind .  Twelve from twenty leaves eight .  You must regain eight hours .  Do you wish to try to do so ?  On foot ? asked Mr . Fogg .  No; on a sledge , replied Fix .  On a sledge with sails .  A man has proposed such a method to me .  It was the man who had spoken to Fix during the night , and whose offer he had refused .  Phileas Fogg did not reply at once; but Fix , having pointed out the man , who was walking up and down in front of the station , Mr . Fogg went up to him .  An instant after , Mr . Fogg and the American , whose name was Mudge , entered a hut built just below the fort .  There Mr . Fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons .  A high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail .  This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib-sail .  Behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle .  It was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop .  During the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . Provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains .  Mr . Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft .  The wind was favourable , being fresh , and blowing from the west .  The snow had hardened , and Mudge was very confident of being able to transport Mr . Fogg in a few hours to Omaha .  Thence the trains eastward run frequently to Chicago and New York .  It was not impossible that the lost time might yet be recovered; and such an opportunity was not to be rejected .  Not wishing to expose Aouda to the discomforts of travelling in the open air , Mr . Fogg proposed to leave her with Passepartout at Fort Kearney , the servant taking upon himself to escort her to Europe by a better route and under more favourable conditions .  But Aouda refused to separate from Mr . Fogg , and Passepartout was delighted with her decision; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while Fix was with him .  It would be difficult to guess the detectives thoughts .  Was this conviction shaken by Phileas Foggs return , or did he still regard him as an exceedingly shrewd rascal , who , his journey round the world completed , would think himself absolutely safe in England ?  Perhaps Fixs opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat modified; but he was nevertheless resolved to do his duty , and to hasten the return of the whole party to England as much as possible .  At eight oclock the sledge was ready to start .  The passengers took their places on it , and wrapped themselves up closely in their travelling-cloaks .  The two great sails were hoisted , and under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a velocity of forty miles an hour .  The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha , as the birds fly , is at most two hundred miles .  If the wind held good , the distance might be traversed in five hours; if no accident happened the sledge might reach Omaha by one oclock .  What a journey!  The travellers , huddled close together , could not speak for the cold , intensified by the rapidity at which they were going .  The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves .  When the breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off the ground by its sails .  Mudge , who was at the rudder , kept in a straight line , and by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the vehicle had a tendency to make .  All the sails were up , and the jib was so arranged as not to screen the brigantine .  A top-mast was hoisted , and another jib , held out to the wind , added its force to the other sails .  Although the speed could not be exactly estimated , the sledge could not be going at less than forty miles an hour .  If nothing breaks , said Mudge , we shall get there!  Mr . Fogg had made it for Mudges interest to reach Omaha within the time agreed on , by the offer of a handsome reward .  The prairie , across which the sledge was moving in a straight line , was as flat as a sea .  It seemed like a vast frozen lake .  The railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south-west to the north-west by Great Island , Columbus , an important Nebraska town , Schuyler , and Fremont , to Omaha .  It followed throughout the right bank of the Platte River .  The sledge , shortening this route , took a chord of the arc described by the railway .  Mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the Platte River , because it was frozen .  The road , then , was quite clear of obstacles , and Phileas Fogg had but two things to fear--an accident to the sledge , and a change or calm in the wind .  But the breeze , far from lessening its force , blew as if to bend the mast , which , however , the metallic lashings held firmly .  These lashings , like the chords of a stringed instrument , resounded as if vibrated by a violin bow .  The sledge slid along in the midst of a plaintively intense melody .  Those chords give the fifth and the octave , said Mr . Fogg .  These were the only words he uttered during the journey .  Aouda , cosily packed in furs and cloaks , was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind .  As for Passepartout , his face was as red as the suns disc when it sets in the mist , and he laboriously inhaled the biting air .  With his natural buoyancy of spirits , he began to hope again .  They would reach New York on the evening , if not on the morning , of the 11th , and there was still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for Liverpool .  Passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally , Fix , by the hand .  He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge , the only means of reaching Omaha in time; but , checked by some presentiment , he kept his usual reserve .  One thing , however , Passepartout would never forget , and that was the sacrifice which Mr . Fogg had made , without hesitation , to rescue him from the Sioux .  Mr . Fogg had risked his fortune and his life . No!  His servant would never forget that!  While each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different , the sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow .  The creeks it passed over were not perceived .  Fields and streams disappeared under the uniform whiteness .  The plain was absolutely deserted .  Between the Union Pacific road and the branch which unites Kearney with Saint Joseph it formed a great uninhabited island .  Neither village , station , nor fort appeared .  From time to time they sped by some phantom-like tree , whose white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind .  Sometimes flocks of wild birds rose , or bands of gaunt , famished , ferocious prairie-wolves ran howling after the sledge .  Passepartout , revolver in hand , held himself ready to fire on those which came too near .  Had an accident then happened to the sledge , the travellers , attacked by these beasts , would have been in the most terrible danger; but it held on its even course , soon gained on the wolves , and ere long left the howling band at a safe distance behind .  About noon Mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was crossing the Platte River .  He said nothing , but he felt certain that he was now within twenty miles of Omaha .  In less than an hour he left the rudder and furled his sails , whilst the sledge , carried forward by the great impetus the wind had given it , went on half a mile further with its sails unspread .  It stopped at last , and Mudge , pointing to a mass of roofs white with snow , said: We have got there!  Arrived!  Arrived at the station which is in daily communication , by numerous trains , with the Atlantic seaboard!  Passepartout and Fix jumped off , stretched their stiffened limbs , and aided Mr . Fogg and the young woman to descend from the sledge .  Phileas Fogg generously rewarded Mudge , whose hand Passepartout warmly grasped , and the party directed their steps to the Omaha railway station .  The Pacific Railroad proper finds its terminus at this important Nebraska town .  Omaha is connected with Chicago by the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad , which runs directly east , and passes fifty stations .  A train was ready to start when Mr . Fogg and his party reached the station , and they only had time to get into the cars .  They had seen nothing of Omaha; but Passepartout confessed to himself that this was not to be regretted , as they were not travelling to see the sights .  The train passed rapidly across the State of Iowa , by Council Bluffs , Des Moines , and Iowa City .  During the night it crossed the Mississippi at Davenport , and by Rock Island entered Illinois .  The next day , which was the 10th , at four oclock in the evening , it reached Chicago , already risen from its ruins , and more proudly seated than ever on the borders of its beautiful Lake Michigan .  Nine hundred miles separated Chicago from New York; but trains are not wanting at Chicago .  Mr . Fogg passed at once from one to the other , and the locomotive of the Pittsburgh , Fort Wayne , and Chicago Railway left at full speed , as if it fully comprehended that that gentleman had no time to lose .  It traversed Indiana , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey like a flash , rushing through towns with antique names , some of which had streets and car-tracks , but as yet no houses .  At last the Hudson came into view; and , at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the 11th , the train stopped in the station on the right bank of the river , before the very pier of the Cunard line .  The China , for Liverpool , had started three-quarters of an hour before!     Chapter XXXII  IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG ENGAGES IN A DIRECT STRUGGLE WITH BAD FORTUNE   The China , in leaving , seemed to have carried off Phileas Foggs last hope .  None of the other steamers were able to serve his projects .  The Pereire , of the French Transatlantic Company , whose admirable steamers are equal to any in speed and comfort , did not leave until the 14th; the Hamburg boats did not go directly to Liverpool or London , but to Havre; and the additional trip from Havre to Southampton would render Phileas Foggs last efforts of no avail .  The Inman steamer did not depart till the next day , and could not cross the Atlantic in time to save the wager .  Mr . Fogg learned all this in consulting his Bradshaw , which gave him the daily movements of the trans-Atlantic steamers .  Passepartout was crushed; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by three-quarters of an hour .  It was his fault , for , instead of helping his master , he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path!  And when he recalled all the incidents of the tour , when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account , when he thought that the immense stake , added to the heavy charges of this useless journey , would completely ruin Mr . Fogg , he overwhelmed himself with bitter self-accusations .  Mr . Fogg , however , did not reproach him; and , on leaving the Cunard pier , only said: We will consult about what is best to-morrow .  Come .  The party crossed the Hudson in the Jersey City ferryboat , and drove in a carriage to the St . Nicholas Hotel , on Broadway .  Rooms were engaged , and the night passed , briefly to Phileas Fogg , who slept profoundly , but very long to Aouda and the others , whose agitation did not permit them to rest .  The next day was the 12th of December .  From seven in the morning of the 12th to a quarter before nine in the evening of the 21st there were nine days , thirteen hours , and forty-five minutes .  If Phileas Fogg had left in the China , one of the fastest steamers on the Atlantic , he would have reached Liverpool , and then London , within the period agreed upon .  Mr . Fogg left the hotel alone , after giving Passepartout instructions to await his return , and inform Aouda to be ready at an instants notice .  He proceeded to the banks of the Hudson , and looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river , for any that were about to depart .  Several had departure signals , and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe .  But they were mostly sailing vessels , of which , of course , Phileas Fogg could make no use .  He seemed about to give up all hope , when he espied , anchored at the Battery , a cables length off at most , a trading vessel , with a screw , well-shaped , whose funnel , puffing a cloud of smoke , indicated that she was getting ready for departure .  Phileas Fogg hailed a boat , got into it , and soon found himself on board the Henrietta , iron-hulled , wood-built above .  He ascended to the deck , and asked for the captain , who forthwith presented himself .  He was a man of fifty , a sort of sea-wolf , with big eyes , a complexion of oxidised copper , red hair and thick neck , and a growling voice .  The captain ? asked Mr . Fogg .  I am the captain .  I am Phileas Fogg , of London .  And I am Andrew Speedy , of Cardiff .  You are going to put to sea ?  In an hour .  You are bound for--  Bordeaux .  And your cargo ?  No freight .  Going in ballast .  Have you any passengers ?  No passengers .  Never have passengers .  Too much in the way .  Is your vessel a swift one ?  Between eleven and twelve knots .  The Henrietta , well known .  Will you carry me and three other persons to Liverpool ?  To Liverpool ?  Why not to China ?  I said Liverpool .  No!  No ?  No .  I am setting out for Bordeaux , and shall go to Bordeaux .  Money is no object ?  None .  The captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a reply .  But the owners of the Henrietta-- resumed Phileas Fogg .  The owners are myself , replied the captain .  The vessel belongs to me .  I will freight it for you .  No .  I will buy it of you .  No .  Phileas Fogg did not betray the least disappointment; but the situation was a grave one .  It was not at New York as at Hong Kong , nor with the captain of the Henrietta as with the captain of the Tankadere .  Up to this time money had smoothed away every obstacle .  Now money failed .  Still , some means must be found to cross the Atlantic on a boat , unless by balloon--which would have been venturesome , besides not being capable of being put in practice .  It seemed that Phileas Fogg had an idea , for he said to the captain , Well , will you carry me to Bordeaux ?  No , not if you paid me two hundred dollars .  I offer you two thousand .  Apiece ?  Apiece .  And there are four of you ?  Four .  Captain Speedy began to scratch his head .  There were eight thousand dollars to gain , without changing his route; for which it was well worth conquering the repugnance he had for all kinds of passengers . Besides , passengers at two thousand dollars are no longer passengers , but valuable merchandise .  I start at nine oclock , said Captain Speedy , simply .  Are you and your party ready ?  We will be on board at nine oclock , replied , no less simply , Mr . Fogg .  It was half-past eight .  To disembark from the Henrietta , jump into a hack , hurry to the St . Nicholas , and return with Aouda , Passepartout , and even the inseparable Fix was the work of a brief time , and was performed by Mr . Fogg with the coolness which never abandoned him . They were on board when the Henrietta made ready to weigh anchor .  When Passepartout heard what this last voyage was going to cost , he uttered a prolonged Oh! which extended throughout his vocal gamut .  As for Fix , he said to himself that the Bank of England would certainly not come out of this affair well indemnified .  When they reached England , even if Mr . Fogg did not throw some handfuls of bank-bills into the sea , more than seven thousand pounds would have been spent!     Chapter XXXIII  IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SHOWS HIMSELF EQUAL TO THE OCCASION   An hour after , the Henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks the entrance of the Hudson , turned the point of Sandy Hook , and put to sea . During the day she skirted Long Island , passed Fire Island , and directed her course rapidly eastward .  At noon the next day , a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the vessels position .  It might be thought that this was Captain Speedy . Not the least in the world .  It was Phileas Fogg , Esquire .  As for Captain Speedy , he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key , and was uttering loud cries , which signified an anger at once pardonable and excessive .  What had happened was very simple .  Phileas Fogg wished to go to Liverpool , but the captain would not carry him there .  Then Phileas Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux , and , during the thirty hours he had been on board , had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the sailors and stokers , who were only an occasional crew , and were not on the best terms with the captain , went over to him in a body .  This was why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why , in short , the Henrietta was directing her course towards Liverpool .  It was very clear , to see Mr . Fogg manage the craft , that he had been a sailor .  How the adventure ended will be seen anon .  Aouda was anxious , though she said nothing .  As for Passepartout , he thought Mr . Foggs manoeuvre simply glorious .  The captain had said between eleven and twelve knots , and the Henrietta confirmed his prediction .  If , then--for there were ifs still--the sea did not become too boisterous , if the wind did not veer round to the east , if no accident happened to the boat or its machinery , the Henrietta might cross the three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days , between the 12th and the 21st of December .  It is true that , once arrived , the affair on board the Henrietta , added to that of the Bank of England , might create more difficulties for Mr . Fogg than he imagined or could desire .  During the first days , they went along smoothly enough .  The sea was not very unpropitious , the wind seemed stationary in the north-east , the sails were hoisted , and the Henrietta ploughed across the waves like a real trans-Atlantic steamer .  Passepartout was delighted .  His masters last exploit , the consequences of which he ignored , enchanted him .  Never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow .  He formed warm friendships with the sailors , and amazed them with his acrobatic feats .  He thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen , and that the stokers fired up like heroes .  His loquacious good-humour infected everyone .  He had forgotten the past , its vexations and delays .  He only thought of the end , so nearly accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over with impatience , as if heated by the furnaces of the Henrietta .  Often , also , the worthy fellow revolved around Fix , looking at him with a keen , distrustful eye; but he did not speak to him , for their old intimacy no longer existed .  Fix , it must be confessed , understood nothing of what was going on . The conquest of the Henrietta , the bribery of the crew , Fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman , amazed and confused him .  He did not know what to think .  For , after all , a man who began by stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and Fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the Henrietta under Foggs command , was not going to Liverpool at all , but to some part of the world where the robber , turned into a pirate , would quietly put himself in safety .  The conjecture was at least a plausible one , and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair .  As for Captain Speedy , he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and Passepartout , whose duty it was to carry him his meals , courageous as he was , took the greatest precautions .  Mr . Fogg did not seem even to know that there was a captain on board .  On the 13th they passed the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland , a dangerous locality; during the winter , especially , there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind .  Ever since the evening before the barometer , suddenly falling , had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere; and during the night the temperature varied , the cold became sharper , and the wind veered to the south-east .  This was a misfortune .  Mr . Fogg , in order not to deviate from his course , furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but the vessels speed slackened , owing to the state of the sea , the long waves of which broke against the stern .  She pitched violently , and this retarded her progress .  The breeze little by little swelled into a tempest , and it was to be feared that the Henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves .  Passepartouts visage darkened with the skies , and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright .  But Phileas Fogg was a bold mariner , and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kept on his course , without even decreasing his steam .  The Henrietta , when she could not rise upon the waves , crossed them , swamping her deck , but passing safely .  Sometimes the screw rose out of the water , beating its protruding end , when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves; but the craft always kept straight ahead .  The wind , however , did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared; it was not one of those tempests which burst , and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour .  It continued fresh , but , unhappily , it remained obstinately in the south-east , rendering the sails useless .  The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Foggs departure from London , and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously delayed .  Half of the voyage was almost accomplished , and the worst localities had been passed .  In summer , success would have been well-nigh certain .  In winter , they were at the mercy of the bad season .  Passepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret , and comforted himself with the reflection that , if the wind failed them , they might still count on the steam .  On this day the engineer came on deck , went up to Mr . Fogg , and began to speak earnestly with him .  Without knowing why it was a presentiment , perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy .  He would have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying .  He finally managed to catch a few words , and was sure he heard his master say , You are certain of what you tell me ?  Certain , sir , replied the engineer .  You must remember that , since we started , we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces , and , though we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux , we havent enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool . I will consider , replied Mr . Fogg .  Passepartout understood it all; he was seized with mortal anxiety .  The coal was giving out!  Ah , if my master can get over that , muttered he , hell be a famous man!  He could not help imparting to Fix what he had overheard .  Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool ?  Of course .  Ass! replied the detective , shrugging his shoulders and turning on his heel .  Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet , the reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but he reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed and humiliated in his self-esteem , after having so awkwardly followed a false scent around the world , and refrained .  And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt ?  It was difficult to imagine .  Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one , for that evening he sent for the engineer , and said to him , Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted .  A few moments after , the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrents of smoke .  The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but on the 18th , the engineer , as he had predicted , announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day .  Do not let the fires go down , replied Mr . Fogg .  Keep them up to the last .  Let the valves be filled .  Towards noon Phileas Fogg , having ascertained their position , called Passepartout , and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy .  It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger .  He went to the poop , saying to himself , He will be like a madman!  In a few moments , with cries and oaths , a bomb appeared on the poop-deck .  The bomb was Captain Speedy .  It was clear that he was on the point of bursting .  Where are we ?  were the first words his anger permitted him to utter .  Had the poor man been an apoplectic , he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath .  Where are we ? he repeated , with purple face .  Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool , replied Mr . Fogg , with imperturbable calmness .  Pirate! cried Captain Speedy .  I have sent for you , sir--  Pickaroon!  --sir , continued Mr . Fogg , to ask you to sell me your vessel .  No!  By all the devils , no!  But I shall be obliged to burn her .  Burn the Henrietta!  Yes; at least the upper part of her .  The coal has given out .  Burn my vessel! cried Captain Speedy , who could scarcely pronounce the words .  A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars!  Here are sixty thousand , replied Phileas Fogg , handing the captain a roll of bank-bills .  This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy .  An American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars .  The captain forgot in an instant his anger , his imprisonment , and all his grudges against his passenger .  The Henrietta was twenty years old; it was a great bargain .  The bomb would not go off after all .  Mr . Fogg had taken away the match .  And I shall still have the iron hull , said the captain in a softer tone .  The iron hull and the engine .  Is it agreed ?  Agreed .  And Andrew Speedy , seizing the banknotes , counted them and consigned them to his pocket .  During this colloquy , Passepartout was as white as a sheet , and Fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit .  Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended , and Fogg left the hull and engine to the captain , that is , near the whole value of the craft!  It was true , however , that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank .  When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money , Mr . Fogg said to him , Dont let this astonish you , sir .  You must know that I shall lose twenty thousand pounds , unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine on the evening of the 21st of December .  I missed the steamer at New York , and as you refused to take me to Liverpool--  And I did well! cried Andrew Speedy; for I have gained at least forty thousand dollars by it!  He added , more sedately , Do you know one thing , Captain--  Fogg .  Captain Fogg , youve got something of the Yankee about you .  And , having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment , he was going away , when Mr . Fogg said , The vessel now belongs to me ?  Certainly , from the keel to the truck of the masts--all the wood , that is .  Very well .  Have the interior seats , bunks , and frames pulled down , and burn them .  It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate pressure , and on that day the poop , cabins , bunks , and the spare deck were sacrificed .  On the next day , the 19th of December , the masts , rafts , and spars were burned; the crew worked lustily , keeping up the fires .  Passepartout hewed , cut , and sawed away with all his might . There was a perfect rage for demolition .  The railings , fittings , the greater part of the deck , and top sides disappeared on the 20th , and the Henrietta was now only a flat hulk . But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and Fastnet Light .  By ten in the evening they were passing Queenstown .  Phileas Fogg had only twenty-four hours more in which to get to London; that length of time was necessary to reach Liverpool , with all steam on .  And the steam was about to give out altogether!  Sir , said Captain Speedy , who was now deeply interested in Mr . Foggs project , I really commiserate you .  Everything is against you .  We are only opposite Queenstown .  Ah , said Mr . Fogg , is that place where we see the lights Queenstown ?  Yes .  Can we enter the harbour ?  Not under three hours .  Only at high tide .  Stay , replied Mr . Fogg calmly , without betraying in his features that by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once more to conquer ill-fortune .  Queenstown is the Irish port at which the trans-Atlantic steamers stop to put off the mails .  These mails are carried to Dublin by express trains always held in readiness to start; from Dublin they are sent on to Liverpool by the most rapid boats , and thus gain twelve hours on the Atlantic steamers .  Phileas Fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way .  Instead of arriving at Liverpool the next evening by the Henrietta , he would be there by noon , and would therefore have time to reach London before a quarter before nine in the evening .  The Henrietta entered Queenstown Harbour at one oclock in the morning , it then being high tide; and Phileas Fogg , after being grasped heartily by the hand by Captain Speedy , left that gentleman on the levelled hulk of his craft , which was still worth half what he had sold it for .  The party went on shore at once .  Fix was greatly tempted to arrest Mr . Fogg on the spot; but he did not .  Why ?  What struggle was going on within him ?  Had he changed his mind about his man ?  Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake ?  He did not , however , abandon Mr . Fogg .  They all got upon the train , which was just ready to start , at half-past one; at dawn of day they were in Dublin; and they lost no time in embarking on a steamer which , disdaining to rise upon the waves , invariably cut through them .  Phileas Fogg at last disembarked on the Liverpool quay , at twenty minutes before twelve , 21st December .  He was only six hours distant from London .  But at this moment Fix came up , put his hand upon Mr . Foggs shoulder , and , showing his warrant , said , You are really Phileas Fogg ?  I am .  I arrest you in the Queens name!     Chapter XXXIV  IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AT LAST REACHES LONDON   Phileas Fogg was in prison .  He had been shut up in the Custom House , and he was to be transferred to London the next day .  Passepartout , when he saw his master arrested , would have fallen upon Fix had he not been held back by some policemen .  Aouda was thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not understand .  Passepartout explained to her how it was that the honest and courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber .  The young womans heart revolted against so heinous a charge , and when she saw that she could attempt to do nothing to save her protector , she wept bitterly .  As for Fix , he had arrested Mr . Fogg because it was his duty , whether Mr . Fogg were guilty or not .  The thought then struck Passepartout , that he was the cause of this new misfortune!  Had he not concealed Fixs errand from his master ?  When Fix revealed his true character and purpose , why had he not told Mr . Fogg ?  If the latter had been warned , he would no doubt have given Fix proof of his innocence , and satisfied him of his mistake; at least , Fix would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of his master , only to arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil . Passepartout wept till he was blind , and felt like blowing his brains out .  Aouda and he had remained , despite the cold , under the portico of the Custom House .  Neither wished to leave the place; both were anxious to see Mr . Fogg again .  That gentleman was really ruined , and that at the moment when he was about to attain his end .  This arrest was fatal .  Having arrived at Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December , he had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club , that is , nine hours and a quarter; the journey from Liverpool to London was six hours .  If anyone , at this moment , had entered the Custom House , he would have found Mr . Fogg seated , motionless , calm , and without apparent anger , upon a wooden bench .  He was not , it is true , resigned; but this last blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion .  Was he being devoured by one of those secret rages , all the more terrible because contained , and which only burst forth , with an irresistible force , at the last moment ?  No one could tell .  There he sat , calmly waiting--for what ?  Did he still cherish hope ?  Did he still believe , now that the door of this prison was closed upon him , that he would succeed ?  However that may have been , Mr . Fogg carefully put his watch upon the table , and observed its advancing hands .  Not a word escaped his lips , but his look was singularly set and stern .  The situation , in any event , was a terrible one , and might be thus stated: if Phileas Fogg was honest he was ruined; if he was a knave , he was caught .  Did escape occur to him ?  Did he examine to see if there were any practicable outlet from his prison ?  Did he think of escaping from it ? Possibly; for once he walked slowly around the room .  But the door was locked , and the window heavily barred with iron rods .  He sat down again , and drew his journal from his pocket .  On the line where these words were written , 21st December , Saturday , Liverpool , he added , 80th day , 11 .40 a .m . , and waited .  The Custom House clock struck one .  Mr . Fogg observed that his watch was two hours too fast .  Two hours!  Admitting that he was at this moment taking an express train , he could reach London and the Reform Club by a quarter before nine , p .m .  His forehead slightly wrinkled .  At thirty-three minutes past two he heard a singular noise outside , then a hasty opening of doors .  Passepartouts voice was audible , and immediately after that of Fix .  Phileas Foggs eyes brightened for an instant .  The door swung open , and he saw Passepartout , Aouda , and Fix , who hurried towards him .  Fix was out of breath , and his hair was in disorder .  He could not speak .  Sir , he stammered , sir--forgive me--most--unfortunate resemblance--robber arrested three days ago--you are free!  Phileas Fogg was free!  He walked to the detective , looked him steadily in the face , and with the only rapid motion he had ever made in his life , or which he ever would make , drew back his arms , and with the precision of a machine knocked Fix down .  Well hit! cried Passepartout , Parbleu! thats what you might call a good application of English fists!  Fix , who found himself on the floor , did not utter a word .  He had only received his deserts .  Mr . Fogg , Aouda , and Passepartout left the Custom House without delay , got into a cab , and in a few moments descended at the station .  Phileas Fogg asked if there was an express train about to leave for London .  It was forty minutes past two .  The express train had left thirty-five minutes before .  Phileas Fogg then ordered a special train .  There were several rapid locomotives on hand; but the railway arrangements did not permit the special train to leave until three oclock .  At that hour Phileas Fogg , having stimulated the engineer by the offer of a generous reward , at last set out towards London with Aouda and his faithful servant .  It was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half; and this would have been easy on a clear road throughout .  But there were forced delays , and when Mr . Fogg stepped from the train at the terminus , all the clocks in London were striking ten minutes before nine .  Having made the tour of the world , he was behind-hand five minutes .  He had lost the wager!     Chapter XXXV  IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG DOES NOT HAVE TO REPEAT HIS ORDERS TO PASSEPARTOUT TWICE   The dwellers in Saville Row would have been surprised the next day , if they had been told that Phileas Fogg had returned home .  His doors and windows were still closed , no appearance of change was visible .  After leaving the station , Mr . Fogg gave Passepartout instructions to purchase some provisions , and quietly went to his domicile .  He bore his misfortune with his habitual tranquillity .  Ruined!  And by the blundering of the detective!  After having steadily traversed that long journey , overcome a hundred obstacles , braved many dangers , and still found time to do some good on his way , to fail near the goal by a sudden event which he could not have foreseen , and against which he was unarmed; it was terrible!  But a few pounds were left of the large sum he had carried with him .  There only remained of his fortune the twenty thousand pounds deposited at Barings , and this amount he owed to his friends of the Reform Club .  So great had been the expense of his tour that , even had he won , it would not have enriched him; and it is probable that he had not sought to enrich himself , being a man who rather laid wagers for honours sake than for the stake proposed .  But this wager totally ruined him .  Mr . Foggs course , however , was fully decided upon; he knew what remained for him to do .  A room in the house in Saville Row was set apart for Aouda , who was overwhelmed with grief at her protectors misfortune .  From the words which Mr . Fogg dropped , she saw that he was meditating some serious project .  Knowing that Englishmen governed by a fixed idea sometimes resort to the desperate expedient of suicide , Passepartout kept a narrow watch upon his master , though he carefully concealed the appearance of so doing .  First of all , the worthy fellow had gone up to his room , and had extinguished the gas burner , which had been burning for eighty days . He had found in the letter-box a bill from the gas company , and he thought it more than time to put a stop to this expense , which he had been doomed to bear .  The night passed .  Mr . Fogg went to bed , but did he sleep ?  Aouda did not once close her eyes .  Passepartout watched all night , like a faithful dog , at his masters door .  Mr . Fogg called him in the morning , and told him to get Aoudas breakfast , and a cup of tea and a chop for himself .  He desired Aouda to excuse him from breakfast and dinner , as his time would be absorbed all day in putting his affairs to rights .  In the evening he would ask permission to have a few moments conversation with the young lady .  Passepartout , having received his orders , had nothing to do but obey them .  He looked at his imperturbable master , and could scarcely bring his mind to leave him .  His heart was full , and his conscience tortured by remorse; for he accused himself more bitterly than ever of being the cause of the irretrievable disaster .  Yes! if he had warned Mr . Fogg , and had betrayed Fixs projects to him , his master would certainly not have given the detective passage to Liverpool , and then--  Passepartout could hold in no longer .  My master!  Mr . Fogg! he cried , why do you not curse me ?  It was my fault that--  I blame no one , returned Phileas Fogg , with perfect calmness .  Go!  Passepartout left the room , and went to find Aouda , to whom he delivered his masters message .  Madam , he added , I can do nothing myself--nothing!  I have no influence over my master; but you , perhaps--  What influence could I have ? replied Aouda .  Mr . Fogg is influenced by no one .  Has he ever understood that my gratitude to him is overflowing ?  Has he ever read my heart ?  My friend , he must not be left alone an instant!  You say he is going to speak with me this evening ?  Yes , madam; probably to arrange for your protection and comfort in England .  We shall see , replied Aouda , becoming suddenly pensive .  Throughout this day (Sunday) the house in Saville Row was as if uninhabited , and Phileas Fogg , for the first time since he had lived in that house , did not set out for his club when Westminster clock struck half-past eleven .  Why should he present himself at the Reform ?  His friends no longer expected him there .  As Phileas Fogg had not appeared in the saloon on the evening before (Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine) , he had lost his wager .  It was not even necessary that he should go to his bankers for the twenty thousand pounds; for his antagonists already had his cheque in their hands , and they had only to fill it out and send it to the Barings to have the amount transferred to their credit .  Mr . Fogg , therefore , had no reason for going out , and so he remained at home .  He shut himself up in his room , and busied himself putting his affairs in order .  Passepartout continually ascended and descended the stairs .  The hours were long for him . He listened at his masters door , and looked through the keyhole , as if he had a perfect right so to do , and as if he feared that something terrible might happen at any moment . Sometimes he thought of Fix , but no longer in anger .  Fix , like all the world , had been mistaken in Phileas Fogg , and had only done his duty in tracking and arresting him; while he , Passepartout .  .  .  .  This thought haunted him , and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly .  Finding himself too wretched to remain alone , he knocked at Aoudas door , went into her room , seated himself , without speaking , in a corner , and looked ruefully at the young woman . Aouda was still pensive .  About half-past seven in the evening Mr . Fogg sent to know if Aouda would receive him , and in a few moments he found himself alone with her .  Phileas Fogg took a chair , and sat down near the fireplace , opposite Aouda .  No emotion was visible on his face .  Fogg returned was exactly the Fogg who had gone away; there was the same calm , the same impassibility .  He sat several minutes without speaking; then , bending his eyes on Aouda , Madam , said he , will you pardon me for bringing you to England ?  I , Mr . Fogg! replied Aouda , checking the pulsations of her heart .  Please let me finish , returned Mr . Fogg .  When I decided to bring you far away from the country which was so unsafe for you , I was rich , and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at your disposal; then your existence would have been free and happy .  But now I am ruined .  I know it , Mr . Fogg , replied Aouda; and I ask you in my turn , will you forgive me for having followed you , and--who knows ?--for having , perhaps , delayed you , and thus contributed to your ruin ?  Madam , you could not remain in India , and your safety could only be assured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors could not take you .  So , Mr . Fogg , resumed Aouda , not content with rescuing me from a terrible death , you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in a foreign land ?  Yes , madam; but circumstances have been against me .  Still , I beg to place the little I have left at your service .  But what will become of you , Mr . Fogg ?  As for me , madam , replied the gentleman , coldly , I have need of nothing .  But how do you look upon the fate , sir , which awaits you ?  As I am in the habit of doing .  At least , said Aouda , want should not overtake a man like you .  Your friends--  I have no friends , madam .  Your relatives--  I have no longer any relatives .  I pity you , then , Mr . Fogg , for solitude is a sad thing , with no heart to which to confide your griefs .  They say , though , that misery itself , shared by two sympathetic souls , may be borne with patience .  They say so , madam .  Mr . Fogg , said Aouda , rising and seizing his hand , do you wish at once a kinswoman and friend ?  Will you have me for your wife ?  Mr . Fogg , at this , rose in his turn .  There was an unwonted light in his eyes , and a slight trembling of his lips .  Aouda looked into his face .  The sincerity , rectitude , firmness , and sweetness of this soft glance of a noble woman , who could dare all to save him to whom she owed all , at first astonished , then penetrated him .  He shut his eyes for an instant , as if to avoid her look .  When he opened them again , I love you! he said , simply .  Yes , by all that is holiest , I love you , and I am entirely yours!  Ah! cried Aouda , pressing his hand to her heart .  Passepartout was summoned and appeared immediately .  Mr . Fogg still held Aoudas hand in his own; Passepartout understood , and his big , round face became as radiant as the tropical sun at its zenith .  Mr . Fogg asked him if it was not too late to notify the Reverend Samuel Wilson , of Marylebone parish , that evening .  Passepartout smiled his most genial smile , and said , Never too late .  It was five minutes past eight .  Will it be for to-morrow , Monday ?  For to-morrow , Monday , said Mr . Fogg , turning to Aouda .  Yes; for to-morrow , Monday , she replied .  Passepartout hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him .     Chapter XXXVI  IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGGS NAME IS ONCE MORE AT A PREMIUM ON CHANGE   It is time to relate what a change took place in English public opinion when it transpired that the real bankrobber , a certain James Strand , had been arrested , on the 17th day of December , at Edinburgh .  Three days before , Phileas Fogg had been a criminal , who was being desperately followed up by the police; now he was an honourable gentleman , mathematically pursuing his eccentric journey round the world .  The papers resumed their discussion about the wager; all those who had laid bets , for or against him , revived their interest , as if by magic; the Phileas Fogg bonds again became negotiable , and many new wagers were made .  Phileas Foggs name was once more at a premium on Change .  His five friends of the Reform Club passed these three days in a state of feverish suspense .  Would Phileas Fogg , whom they had forgotten , reappear before their eyes!  Where was he at this moment ?  The 17th of December , the day of James Strands arrest , was the seventy-sixth since Phileas Foggs departure , and no news of him had been received .  Was he dead ?  Had he abandoned the effort , or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon ?  And would he appear on Saturday , the 21st of December , at a quarter before nine in the evening , on the threshold of the Reform Club saloon ?  The anxiety in which , for three days , London society existed , cannot be described .  Telegrams were sent to America and Asia for news of Phileas Fogg .  Messengers were dispatched to the house in Saville Row morning and evening .  No news .  The police were ignorant what had become of the detective , Fix , who had so unfortunately followed up a false scent . Bets increased , nevertheless , in number and value .  Phileas Fogg , like a racehorse , was drawing near his last turning-point .  The bonds were quoted , no longer at a hundred below par , but at twenty , at ten , and at five; and paralytic old Lord Albemarle bet even in his favour .  A great crowd was collected in Pall Mall and the neighbouring streets on Saturday evening; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanently established around the Reform Club .  Circulation was impeded , and everywhere disputes , discussions , and financial transactions were going on .  The police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd , and as the hour when Phileas Fogg was due approached , the excitement rose to its highest pitch .  The five antagonists of Phileas Fogg had met in the great saloon of the club .  John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin , the bankers , Andrew Stuart , the engineer , Gauthier Ralph , the director of the Bank of England , and Thomas Flanagan , the brewer , one and all waited anxiously .  When the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight , Andrew Stuart got up , saying , Gentlemen , in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between Mr . Fogg and ourselves will have expired .  What time did the last train arrive from Liverpool ?  asked Thomas Flanagan .  At twenty-three minutes past seven , replied Gauthier Ralph; and the next does not arrive till ten minutes after twelve .  Well , gentlemen , resumed Andrew Stuart , if Phileas Fogg had come in the 7:23 train , he would have got here by this time .  We can , therefore , regard the bet as won .  Wait; dont let us be too hasty , replied Samuel Fallentin .  You know that Mr . Fogg is very eccentric .  His punctuality is well known; he never arrives too soon , or too late; and I should not be surprised if he appeared before us at the last minute .  Why , said Andrew Stuart nervously , if I should see him , I should not believe it was he .  The fact is , resumed Thomas Flanagan , Mr . Foggs project was absurdly foolish .  Whatever his punctuality , he could not prevent the delays which were certain to occur; and a delay of only two or three days would be fatal to his tour .  Observe , too , added John Sullivan , that we have received no intelligence from him , though there are telegraphic lines all along his route .  He has lost , gentleman , said Andrew Stuart , he has a hundred times lost!  You know , besides , that the China the only steamer he could have taken from New York to get here in time arrived yesterday .  I have seen a list of the passengers , and the name of Phileas Fogg is not among them .  Even if we admit that fortune has favoured him , he can scarcely have reached America .  I think he will be at least twenty days behind-hand , and that Lord Albemarle will lose a cool five thousand .  It is clear , replied Gauthier Ralph; and we have nothing to do but to present Mr . Foggs cheque at Barings to-morrow .  At this moment , the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty minutes to nine .  Five minutes more , said Andrew Stuart .  The five gentlemen looked at each other .  Their anxiety was becoming intense; but , not wishing to betray it , they readily assented to Mr . Fallentins proposal of a rubber .  I wouldnt give up my four thousand of the bet , said Andrew Stuart , as he took his seat , for three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine .  The clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine .  The players took up their cards , but could not keep their eyes off the clock .  Certainly , however secure they felt , minutes had never seemed so long to them!  Seventeen minutes to nine , said Thomas Flanagan , as he cut the cards which Ralph handed to him .  Then there was a moment of silence .  The great saloon was perfectly quiet; but the murmurs of the crowd outside were heard , with now and then a shrill cry .  The pendulum beat the seconds , which each player eagerly counted , as he listened , with mathematical regularity .  Sixteen minutes to nine! said John Sullivan , in a voice which betrayed his emotion .  One minute more , and the wager would be won .  Andrew Stuart and his partners suspended their game .  They left their cards , and counted the seconds .  At the fortieth second , nothing .  At the fiftieth , still nothing .  At the fifty-fifth , a loud cry was heard in the street , followed by applause , hurrahs , and some fierce growls .  The players rose from their seats .  At the fifty-seventh second the door of the saloon opened; and the pendulum had not beat the sixtieth second when Phileas Fogg appeared , followed by an excited crowd who had forced their way through the club doors , and in his calm voice , said , Here I am , gentlemen!     Chapter XXXVII  IN WHICH IT IS SHOWN THAT PHILEAS FOGG GAINED NOTHING BY HIS TOUR AROUND THE WORLD , UNLESS IT WERE HAPPINESS   Yes; Phileas Fogg in person .  The reader will remember that at five minutes past eight in the evening--about five and twenty hours after the arrival of the travellers in London--Passepartout had been sent by his master to engage the services of the Reverend Samuel Wilson in a certain marriage ceremony , which was to take place the next day .  Passepartout went on his errand enchanted .  He soon reached the clergymans house , but found him not at home .  Passepartout waited a good twenty minutes , and when he left the reverend gentleman , it was thirty-five minutes past eight .  But in what a state he was!  With his hair in disorder , and without his hat , he ran along the street as never man was seen to run before , overturning passers-by , rushing over the sidewalk like a waterspout .  In three minutes he was in Saville Row again , and staggered back into Mr . Foggs room .  He could not speak .  What is the matter ? asked Mr . Fogg .  My master! gasped Passepartout--marriage--impossible--  Impossible ?  Impossible--for to-morrow .  Why so ?  Because to-morrow--is Sunday!  Monday , replied Mr . Fogg .  No--to-day is Saturday .  Saturday ?  Impossible!  Yes , yes , yes , yes! cried Passepartout .  You have made a mistake of one day!  We arrived twenty-four hours ahead of time; but there are only ten minutes left!  Passepartout had seized his master by the collar , and was dragging him along with irresistible force .  Phileas Fogg , thus kidnapped , without having time to think , left his house , jumped into a cab , promised a hundred pounds to the cabman , and , having run over two dogs and overturned five carriages , reached the Reform Club .  The clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appeared in the great saloon .  Phileas Fogg had accomplished the journey round the world in eighty days!  Phileas Fogg had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds!  How was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made this error of a day ?  How came he to think that he had arrived in London on Saturday , the twenty-first day of December , when it was really Friday , the twentieth , the seventy-ninth day only from his departure ?  The cause of the error is very simple .  Phileas Fogg had , without suspecting it , gained one day on his journey , and this merely because he had travelled constantly eastward; he would , on the contrary , have lost a day had he gone in the opposite direction , that is , westward .  In journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun , and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction .  There are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth; and these three hundred and sixty degrees , multiplied by four minutes , gives precisely twenty-four hours--that is , the day unconsciously gained .  In other words , while Phileas Fogg , going eastward , saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times , his friends in London only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times .  This is why they awaited him at the Reform Club on Saturday , and not Sunday , as Mr . Fogg thought .  And Passepartouts famous family watch , which had always kept London time , would have betrayed this fact , if it had marked the days as well as the hours and the minutes!  Phileas Fogg , then , had won the twenty thousand pounds; but , as he had spent nearly nineteen thousand on the way , the pecuniary gain was small .  His object was , however , to be victorious , and not to win money .  He divided the one thousand pounds that remained between Passepartout and the unfortunate Fix , against whom he cherished no grudge .  He deducted , however , from Passepartouts share the cost of the gas which had burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twenty hours , for the sake of regularity .  That evening , Mr . Fogg , as tranquil and phlegmatic as ever , said to Aouda: Is our marriage still agreeable to you ?  Mr . Fogg , replied she , it is for me to ask that question .  You were ruined , but now you are rich again .  Pardon me , madam; my fortune belongs to you .  If you had not suggested our marriage , my servant would not have gone to the Reverend Samuel Wilsons , I should not have been apprised of my error , and--  Dear Mr . Fogg! said the young woman .  Dear Aouda! replied Phileas Fogg .  It need not be said that the marriage took place forty-eight hours after , and that Passepartout , glowing and dazzling , gave the bride away .  Had he not saved her , and was he not entitled to this honour ?  The next day , as soon as it was light , Passepartout rapped vigorously at his masters door .  Mr . Fogg opened it , and asked , Whats the matter , Passepartout ?  What is it , sir ?  Why , Ive just this instant found out--  What ?  That we might have made the tour of the world in only seventy-eight days .  No doubt , returned Mr . Fogg , by not crossing India .  But if I had not crossed India , I should not have saved Aouda; she would not have been my wife , and--  Mr . Fogg quietly shut the door .  Phileas Fogg had won his wager , and had made his journey around the world in eighty days .  To do this he had employed every means of conveyance--steamers , railways , carriages , yachts , trading-vessels , sledges , elephants .  The eccentric gentleman had throughout displayed all his marvellous qualities of coolness and exactitude .  But what then ?  What had he really gained by all this trouble ?  What had he brought back from this long and weary journey ?  Nothing , say you ?  Perhaps so; nothing but a charming woman , who , strange as it may appear , made him the happiest of men!  Truly , would you not for less than that make the tour around the world ? CHAPTER I .  OFF THE CHILIAN COAST .   Great spark plugs!  Strike me lucky!  Py shiminy Grismus!  There were three surprised and excited boys on the rounded deck of the submarine boat Grampus . It was a calm , cloudless night , and the sea was as smooth as a mill pond; but , for all that , the night was cloudless , a dank , clinging fog had rolled down from the Andes and out upon the ocean , blotting out moon and star and rendering their surroundings as black as Erebus .  The Grampus was proceeding slowly northward along the Chilian coast . Motor Matt , Dick Ferral , and Carl Pretzel were on the deck forward , keeping a sharp lookout . The electric projector from the conning tower bored a gleaming hole into the darkness ahead , giving the lads a limited view in that direction . Speake was half in and half out of the conning tower , steering from that position .  The waters gurgled and lapped at the rounded sides of the boat , then floated rearward in long lines of phosphorescence , spreading out in the wake like two sticks of an open fan . At the stern of the submarine the propeller churned up a glittering froth .  What the boys saw , however , that had aroused their startled exclamations was a cluster as of glowing lights a foot or two under the surface of the water . This mysterious glow was moving , at a moderate rate of speed , in a course that crossed that of the Grampus .  Slow down , Speake! called Matt to the helmsman .  The jingle of a bell , down in the motor room , was heard faintly , and the submarines speed fell off perceptibly . The cluster of starlike points bubbled onward , missed the bow of the Grampus by a few feet , and vanished in the gloom on the port side .  Vat it iss ? murmured Carl , rubbing a hand dazedly across his eyes . Dere iss lighdning pugs on der land , und I vonder iss dere lighdning pug fishes in der sea ? Dot looked schust like a shark mit some search lights on his headt .  Im a Fiji if there was any fish about that , averred the bewildered Dick . Can you rise to it , matey ? he asked , turning to Matt . What sort of a sizing do you give it ?  The king of the motor boys was puzzled .  It might be a piece of drift from the shore , he answered , or the fragment of a wreck .  Aber it moofed! exclaimed Carl . It moofed droo der vater schust like it vas alife!  The current may have caused that . There are all kinds of currents in this part of the ocean .  Und der lights , Matt . Pieces oof wreck dond haf lights like dot!  That was a trick of the phosphorescence . There were probably nails or spikes in the timber , and wherever they projected and caused a ripple there was a glow in the water .  Matt turned to Speake .  Make a turn to the left , Speake , said he . The submarine swerved slowly to the port tack . There , said Matt; hold her so .  Dick gave a low laugh .  You dont take much stock in that explanation of yours , matey , he remarked , or you wouldnt be following that bit of supposed flotsam and jetsam .  Ive explained it in the only way I know how , Dick , returned Matt , but Im still a good deal in doubt . Well see if we can overhaul the thing and make a further examination . I dont like to take the time , but it may turn out to be time well spent .  Motor Matt knelt well forward , just where the V-shaped waves parted over the sharp nose of the Grampus , and while he knelt he peered fixedly into the water ahead .  Youre such a cautious chap , spoke up Dick , hanging to one of the flagstaff guys and likewise staring ahead , that Ive been all ahoo wondering why you were doing this night cruising . The nights as black as a pocket , and this coast is about as dangerous as you can find anywhere , and yet here we are , groping our way along , never knowing what minute we may bounce upon a reef or say how do you do to a sharp rock .  Remember that Pacific Mail boat we spoke yesterday ? inquired Matt , over his shoulder .  The one that told us they had news , in Santiago , that a Japanese boat had got away from the Chilian , Captain Sandoval , below the Strait of Magellan ? responded Dick .  Exactly . When we left English Reach , at the western end of the strait , we know Captain Sandoval , of the Chilian warship Salvadore , was pursuing the mysterious Japanese steamer; and we also know that that steamer had on board our enemies , the Sons of the Rising Sun . The mail boat said the news that the steamer had escaped the Salvadore had been flashed by wireless from Punta Arenas , and had been repeated by telegraph to Santiago and Valparaiso .  I dond pelieve dot Chap poat efer got avay from der Salvatore! declared Carl .  It may be that she did , Carl , went on Matt , and weve got to make sure of it just as soon as we possibly can . Thats the reason were traveling through this thick fog , and taking our chances on hitting a reef or sunken rock . Weve got to reach Lota and find out for sure if those Japs are again free to bother us . You know what it means if the Sons of the Rising Sun got away from Sandoval . Those misguided Japs have sworn that the Grampus shall never be turned over to the United States Government at Mare Island Navy Yard . Theyre a desperate and fanatical lot , and weve got to know just what were up against , so far as they are concerned . Lota is on the railroad and telegraph line , and well get news there , if anywhere .  As usual , observed Dick , that head of yours has been working , old ship , while the rest of us have been wondering what you were trying to do . I dont think youll catch up with that piece of drift .  Nor I , Matt answered , getting to his feet and coming aft . Whatever that was , I suspect well never be able to discover , so my guess will have to stand . Put her on the starboard tack , Speake , he added to the man in the conning tower .  The submarine once more resumed her course toward Arauco Bay and Lota .  You fellows go below and turn in , Matt went on to Dick and Carl . I can con the ship , all right , and theres no need of the two of you staying awake and helping me on the lookout .  Youd better let Glennie relieve you , mate , suggested Dick . Youve been on deck duty for six hours .  Im going to stay right here , said Matt , until we get safely into Arauco Bay .  There was no use arguing with Motor Matt when he made up his mind that duty commanded him to do a certain thing , and Dick and Carl wished him luck and went below .  Ensign Glennie was lying on the locker in the periscope room .  You shifted the course , said he , rising on one elbow and peering at Dick and Carl as they dropped off the iron ladder . What was up ?  Someting mit a shiny headt vent past us , replied Carl , dropping down on a stool and beginning to draw off his shoes .  Something with a shiny head ? queried the nonplused ensign .  Yah , so . It vas a funny pitzness .  What was it , Dick ?  Im by , answered Dick , shaking his head . Ive seen a good many queer things afloat , but that was the queerest . It was too dark to see much , though . Mayhap if wed had a little more light , we could have made a closer examination and the mystery would have been explained .  Thereupon he went into details , telling Glennie all that he and Carl knew .  Can you make anything out of it , Glennie ? Dick finished .  Im over my head , like the rest of you , answered the ensign . Probably Matt hit it off pretty well when he said it was a bit of water-logged drift , floating between two waves , with spikes cutting the water and throwing off gleams of phosphorescence . This part of the Pacific is full of cross-currents . And its a mighty dangerous stretch of water , too , Im telling you . Matt is certainly anxious to reach Lota , or hed never persist in pushing through waters like these in such a fog .  Hes worrying again over those Sons of the Rising Sun .  Dick pulled off one of his shoes and swung it reflectively in his hand .  I dont think it is possible that that Jap steamer got away from Sandoval , said Glennie . The officers on that mail boat must have got it wrong .  Our old raggie is bound to find out just how much truth there is in the yarn , anyhow , continued Dick . Were what you might call on the last leg of our cruise , and the little old Grampus has covered the east coast of two continents and is well up the west coast . We have dodged trouble in pretty good shape , so far , and Matt dont intend to let the Sons of the Rising Sun put us down and out at this late stage of the game .  The Japs cant put Motor Matt down and out , averred Glennie , with suppressed admiration . He has met them at every point , and has given them the worst of it . Theyll never be able to destroy the Grampus . Mark what I say , my lads , Motor Matt is going to make good with ground to spare , and chalk up another victory for the motor boys .  Dick and Carl would have cheered this warm sentiment , but before they had a chance to do so , a wild yell came from Speake .  Tumble up here , you fellows! Quick , now!  Speake , as he spoke , crushed himself against the side of the conning-tower hatch , in order to make room for those in the periscope room to pass him and reach the deck .  Startled by the words and wildly excited manner of the helmsman , Dick , Carl , and Glennie lost not an instant in rushing up the ladder and dropping over the side of the conning tower .  Wheres Matt ? cried Dick .  Thats just what I want to know , answered Speake , his consternation growing and a tremulous awe finding its way into his voice . He was on the deck a few minutes ago , but he isnt here now . The last I saw of him he went aft , around the conning tower . The next thing I knew , when I turned and looked for him , he wasnt aboard .  All three of the lads were stricken dumb . For a brief space none of them spoke , but looked toward each other in the gloom , frantically alarmed and vaguely fearing--they knew not what .  He couldnt have fallen overboard , spoke up Glennie , first to break the silence that held them as by an uncanny spell , and yet its certain hes not on the boat .  Matt! roared Dick , making a trumpet of his hands and calling into the blank darkness . Ahoy , Matt!  No answer was returned . All that could be heard was the hum of the submarines motor , the swish of the propeller , and the lap and gurgle of waves along the rounded side .  Carl began to whimper .  Ach , du lieber! Oof anyting has habbened py dot bard oof mine , I dond know vat I shall do , py shinks! He vas der pest friendt vat I efer hat , und----  Put about , Speake! cried Dick , now thoroughly alive to the situation . If Matt went overboard , then were rushing away from him , and hes swimming somewhere in our wake .  The shaken helmsman immediately turned the Grampus in a wide circle and rang for full speed .     CHAPTER II .  HURLED INTO THE SEA .   Matt was very much worried when Dick and Carl , agreeably to their orders , went below . It was not the strange visitor that had passed the bows of the Grampus on its glowing way that rested heavily on his mind , but the news gathered from the captain of the mail boat that had been spoken early in the day .  On leaving the western end of the Strait of Magellan , the submarine and her crew had , as they supposed , left behind them for the rest of their cruise their wily enemies , the Sons of the Rising Sun . They had had trouble enough on account of the Japanese while coming through the strait , and Matt thought that he and his friends were entitled to a respite , so far as the nefarious plots of the fanatical young Japs were concerned .[A]  [A] The adventures of the motor boys , in and around Magellan Strait , were set forth in No . 19 of the MOTOR STORIES , entitled , Motor Matts Defiance; or , Around the Horn .  It was the responsibility for the safety of the Grampus that rested so heavily on the young motorists mind . Weeks before , when the submarine had left Belize , British Honduras , Captain Nemo , Jr . , the owner of the boat , had placed the craft entirely in Matts hands .  I wouldnt trust the Grampus with any one else , Matt , declared the captain . But youve got nerve , your judgment is good , you know the craft from one end to the other , and whenever anything goes wrong and you get into a scrape , youve got a knack of always getting out of it without much damage to yourself . A hundred thousand dollars is to be paid for the Grampus when she reaches Mare Island . If the submarine doesnt reach there in good condition , the money will not be paid . Sickness will detain me for a while in Belize , and so that puts this work of taking the boat around the Horn up to you . Now go ahead!  Motor Matt appreciated to the full Captain Nemo , Jr .s trust and confidence . He had vowed to himself over and over again that he would prove to the captain he was worthy of the trust reposed in him . Matt was thinking of all this on the deck of the Grampus , after Dick and Carl had left him; and , in the midst of his reflection , he fancied he heard a muffled sound from somewhere in the submarines wake .  Instantly alarmed , he passed the conning tower , without exchanging any words with Speake , and took up a position not far from the churning propeller . But he heard nothing further , and could see nothing either to increase or diminish his fears . He was just turning about to make his way forward , when a coil struck about his throat , drawing taut on the instant and preventing any outcry . At the same instant there came an irresistible pull backward .  Matt , astounded by this unexpected attack , reaching him from some point away from the boat and darting silently and suddenly out of the thick gloom , flung up his hands in an attempt to clutch one of the wire guys of the periscope mast .  He missed the guy by a fraction of an inch , slipped downward over the rounded deck and rolled into the water . He made little noise , so little that Speake could not hear it above the swirl of waves thrown up by the rounded plates of the Grampus .  Another moment and Matt was in the water and swimming . The deadly compression at his throat continued , and he was unable to voice a sound . He could see the little search light of the submarine moving rapidly onward into the darkness , and could see the half of Speakes form , like a blot of shadow , rearing out of the tower hatch .  All this time Matt felt the pull of the rope about his neck , drawing him steadily and remorselessly away into the foggy night . No one spoke behind him , and there was not the slightest sound to tell him who his captors were , or where they were , or how they had succeeded in making him a victim in that mysterious fashion .  A minute , two minutes , passed . At the end of that time Matt felt his strength leaving him because of the strangling grip about his throat . Then , suddenly , the rearward pull relaxed and the constriction at his throat ceased . With one hand he reached upward and pulled the strangling coil loose and gulped down a deep draught of air .  A moment later he gave vent to a cry , hoping to attract the attention of Speake . But the Grampus was too far away . With difficulty Matt freed himself of his shoes and coat . He had no idea how long he would have to swim , but he prepared himself to keep afloat as long as possible . What the end was to be he did not know , and he had no time to give to that phase of the question .  Some mysterious force had hurled him from the deck of the Grampus into the sea , and perhaps this same force would continue to take care of him . Turning about in the water , he lifted himself high with a downward stroke of his powerful arms , and peered in the direction from which the attack had come . He could see nothing and could hear nothing .  For a moment Motor Matt was tempted to forget his dire plight in marveling over the mysterious nature of that attack . The next instant , however , he began asking himself if it would be possible to reach the Chilian shore . It was a mile away , at least . To swim such a distance was no very extraordinary feat , but there were currents sucking Matt oceanward , and against these it was powerless for him to struggle .  Matt could keep afloat , but to what purpose ? Would it be possible for him to keep on the surface until his friends on the submarine discovered his absence and put back to his rescue ? Even if he could swim for that length of time , could his friends find him in that darkness , with the current dragging him farther and farther from the course over which the Grampus had recently passed ?  In Motor Matts place , a good many lads would have given up the struggle , but Matt was of different calibre . As long as there was a breath in his body he would fight , for he knew that while there is life there is always hope .  Blindly and doggedly he continued his battle with the waves , peering into the northeast from time to time , in the hope of seeing the search light of the Grampus . He did not see the search light , but he saw something else lying sluggishly in the water not a great distance from where he was .  A log! he thought .  Under the impression that fate had thrown across his path a bit of drift from the mainland , he swam to the object and laid hold of it as it heaved and ducked on the placid waves .  It was not a log . As he put out one hand it came in contact with smooth , wet metal . The object was a long cylinder , blunt at one end and pointed at the other .  A torpedo! ran his thought , as he hung over the rounded object with one arm and supported himself in the water . Who fired the torpedo ? was the question he asked himself .  He had leisure now for a little reflection . No strength was required to keep himself afloat , for the steel cylinder supported him .  As he hung there , lifting and falling with the long , deadly tube , his thoughts harked back to the queer object he , and Dick , and Carl had seen in the water . The result of his reflections paralyzed him .  Some mysterious enemy had launched the torpedo at the Grampus!  Had the infernal machine struck the submarine , the craft and every one aboard would have been torn to pieces .  A slow horror pulsed through Motor Matts veins .  The same enemies who had launched the torpedo must surely have jerked Matt from the deck of the submarine . But who were they ? where were they ?  With difficulty he lifted himself and got astride the rolling cylinder . From that elevated position he looked around him into the darkness . Silence reigned in every direction . There was no sign of the mysterious foes who had attempted to destroy the Grampus and to make a prisoner of her commanding officer .  Presently the young motorist became conscious that the coil was still about his throat , and that a long object was trailing downward and hanging with some weight from his neck .  It was a rope . He began pulling it in , coiling the wet length of it in his hand . The rope was all of seventy-five feet long , he judged , and that distance must have marked the position of his foes when the noose was cast . To see even half that distance into the thick darkness was impossible , but why had Matt not been able to hear the men who had attempted such dastardly work ?  Speculations were useless . Matt , however , had secured a makeshift raft which would keep him afloat until such time as the Grampus , or some other boat , could pick him up .  Hoping that the submarine would come to no harm , and determined to make the best of his desperate situation , the king of the motor boys set about making an examination of the steel tube that supported him .     CHAPTER III .  SAVED BY A TORPEDO .   Matts first move was to take the noose from about his throat and pass the rope around and around the torpedo , tying it fast . The loops of the rope gave him a handhold which he could not possibly have secured otherwise on the hard , smooth shell , rendered slippery by the water with which it was drenched .  The torpedo , he quickly discovered , was a Whitehead--a powerful and deadly engine in use by all the navies of the world .  It was about seventeen feet long and a foot and a half in diameter . Torpedoes of this nature are constructed to run under the surface at any required depth down to twenty feet . A propeller and compressed air furnishes the motive power , and as the air becomes exhausted , the torpedo rises higher and higher . With the air shut off and engine stopped , the cylinder rises to the surface . As that was the case in the present instance , it seemed certain that the motive power of this particular torpedo had been nearly exhausted .  The Grampus , being constructed for work in time of war , had torpedo tubes and one torpedo aboard . Matt had studied the mechanism of the Whitehead , and he was able to proceed intelligently in his present dilemma . If there was still any air in the big tube , he might use it to carry him to the north and east , in the direction taken by the Grampus .  The lever , he discovered , which locked the engine was standing erect , while the tripper , which worked automatically the instant the torpedo was discharged and put it under its own power , was lying flat on the curved side .  Before trying to get the compressed air in the shell to working , he swam to the blunt end of the torpedo and removed the small propeller that manipulated the firing pin . By this wise move he rendered harmless the explosive within the shell .  Swimming back , he mounted his queer raft by means of the rope loops , lifted the tripper , and depressed the starting lever .  The twin screws , placed tandem fashion at the stern , began slowly to revolve . Heading the point of the tube north by east , he began one of the strangest rides that had ever fallen to his lot .  As the air within became more and more depleted , the steel cylinder rose higher and higher in the water .  For a lad so deeply in love with motors as was Matt , the novelty of that ride could not fail to appeal to him . He was safe , at least for a time , and felt sure that ultimately he would gain the shore or be picked up by a coastwise ship . As for the Grampus , there were cool heads and steady nerves aboard of her , and the submarines safety would be looked after . Besides , the mysterious foes had failed in their nights work , and there was probably no more danger to be apprehended from them .  As Matt held himself astride his queer craft , guiding it by a pull this way and that , he fell to thinking of the manner in which he had been hurled into the sea .  Some boat had discharged the torpedo , and it seemed certain that those who had tossed the rope over his head and pulled him from the submarines deck had been on the same boat .  Had it been the intention of Matts enemies to haul him aboard their boat , or only to strangle him and keep him in the water until the Grampus got well away , then cast him off and let him sink to the bottom ?  Matts humane instincts rebelled against the latter supposition . His enemies , he reasoned , had intended hauling him aboard their boat , but in some manner had lost hold of the end of the line .  A Whitehead torpedo costs something like four thousand dollars , and is altogether too valuable to leave adrift when it has been fired and misses its target . Those who had discharged the torpedo would surely look for it--and , if they found it , they would also find Matt .  This caused the young motorist a good deal of trepidation . He reasoned , however , that on account of the darkness of the night and the fog , his mysterious foes would probably remain in the part of the ocean where the torpedo had been fired and look for it in the daylight . Between that hour and daylight , Matt was hoping to be picked up .  The compressed air in a torpedo will carry it about nine hundred yards . This torpedo had not gone its full distance , on account of an automatic misplacement of the tripper and starting lever , but enough of the air had been used so that Matts ride was a short one .  After a few minutes the propellers ceased to revolve , and Matt and the steel cylinder came to a stop , heaving up and down on the surface of the water . Yielding to the pull of the current , the torpedo started erratically seaward , and another fear was born in Matts mind .  The farther seaward he was carried , the more difficult it would be to fall in with a passing boat , and the farther off would be his rescue . To carry his grewsome thoughts still farther , there was a good chance that he would succumb to thirst and hunger before his woeful plight was discovered , and----  But this gloomy train of reflections was interrupted . In the distance Matt could see a glow of light , shining hazily through the fog . Was it the search light of the Grampus , or a gleam from the other boat ?  Divided between hopes and doubts , he waited and watched . The glow presently resolved itself into a pencil of light , and he became fairly positive that it was the searching eye of the submarine .  Ahoy! he shouted .  Instantly a distant commotion struck on his ears .  Ahoy , ahoy! came an excited answer . Is that you , Matt ?  Yes . Shift your wheel a couple of points to starboard and youll be heading straight for me . Come slow--and dont run me down .  The gleam of light suddenly shifted its position . Aiming directly at Matt , it grew brighter and brighter . Matt was able to make out the dark outlines of the submarines low deck and conning tower , and to see three figures well forward toward the bow , all clinging to guys and leaning out over the water .  Are you swimming , old ship ? came the tense voice of Dick Ferral .  Hardly , Matt answered . Ive been in the water for upward of an hour--and I couldnt have fought the current that long if I had been compelled to swim .  How you vas keeping off der pottom , Matt ? piped up the relieved voice of Carl .  Theres a sort of a raft under me , Matt laughed .  A raft ? Where the dickens did you get hold of a raft , Matt ?  This was Glennie .  Not exactly a raft , went on Matt , but a Whitehead torpedo . We met each other at just the right time for me . Im riding the torpedo , and its a fine thing for keeping a fellow afloat .  Startled expressions came from those on the submarine . By then the Grampus was so close that her search light had Matt and the Whitehead in full glare . The amazement of the boys on the submarine increased .  Dots der plamedest ting vat I efer heardt oof! gasped Carl . Modor Matt riding on a dorpeto schust like it vas a tree , oder someting like dot! Ach , himmelblitzen!  Speake guided the Grampus alongside the torpedo .  Be careful , Speake! warned Glennie . If that infernal machine bunts into us , were gone .  Im looking out for that , answered Speake .  You dont need to worry , called Matt reassuringly . I wasnt going to take chances with two hundred pounds of high explosive , and one of the first things I did was to fix the priming pin so it wouldnt work .  The Grampus , responding to a signal flashed into the motor room , came to a halt . Dick threw Matt a rope , and he began tying it to one of the loops that encircled the shell of the torpedo .  Why are you making fast , matey ? inquired Dick .  Because I want to tow this torpedo into Lota , answered Matt .  Oh , bother that! Here weve been all ahoo thinking you were at the bottom and as good as done for . Now that weve found you again--and in a most amazing way , at that--cut loose from that steel tube and come aboard . Whats the use of fussing with it ?  Ill explain when I come aboard , Matt went on . Make the other end of the line fast , Dick , and give the cable a scope of fifty feet . Ive hooked to her so that she will follow us stern foremost .  Glennie helped Dick make the cable fast; then Matt , drawing in on the line , came alongside the rounded deck plates , and Carl helped him off the torpedo .  Ach , vat a habbiness! sputtered Carl . I hat gifen you oop for deadt , Matt , und vat shouldt I efer have done mitoudt my bard ? How you come to be like dot , hey ?  Theres something mighty mysterious about it , said Matt . I thought I heard a noise somewhere in the darkness behind the Grampus , and stepped aft to watch and listen; then , before I knew what was up , the noose of a rope fell over my head and tightened about my throat . I went into the water with hardly a splash , unable to give a cry for help .  I didnt hear a sound! put in Speake excitedly .  It was all done so quickly and silently , I dont see how you could have known anything about it , Speake , said Matt . I was in a bad way when I sighted that torpedo . I got astride of it , started the propellers , and rode in the direction the Grampus had taken . When the compressed air gave out , I was expecting to be picked up by some other boat--by the boat that had fired the torpedo at us .  At us! exclaimed Glennie . Do you mean to say that torpedo that saved you was launched at the Grampus ?  Exactly , returned Matt . It was the torpedo Dick , Carl , and I saw , and which I thought might be a floating log or a piece of wreckage .  This astounding intelligence almost carried Matts chums off their feet .  What enemies have we in these waters ? cried the startled Glennie .  Why , answered Matt , who but the Sons of the Rising Sun ?     CHAPTER IV .  WEIGHING THE EVIDENCE .   Lets go below , mates , suggested Dick , and overhaul all this . Theres meat in it for us , and it will stand us in hand to get at it .  Ill not go below this night , Dick , said Matt , and wed better all of us stay on deck and keep our eyes peeled for Japs . Carl can go and bring me up some dry clothes , an extra pair of shoes and stockings , and an extra coat .  Dots me , bard , chirruped Carl , making for the conning tower .  Get the boat on her proper course , Speake , said Matt; we must get out of this neighborhood as soon as we can--and as quick as we can . Watch the torpedo as we come about , Dick , you and Glennie . See that the cable doesnt foul the guys or the periscope mast .  Speake signaled for a fresh start , and as the submarine described a circle and pointed the other way , Dick and Glennie kept the hawser clear . The torpedo took its scope of cable , and the drag of it was plainly felt as soon as the submarine began to pull .  Its main lucky , mates , remarked Dick , as Carl regained the deck with Matts dry clothing , and the young motorist began to get out of his wet togs , that weve such a smooth sea . If the wind was blowing hard and the water was choppy , Matt would have a hard time with that torpedo of his .  A lucky thing , too , added Glennie , that theres a thick fog . If Matts enemies had seen him , theyd have finished the work they set out to do with that lariat .  On the other hand , Glennie , put in Matt , we dont want to forget that it was the fog that enabled them to come so close . Their boat must have got within seventy-five feet of the Grampus in order for any one to drop that noose over my head .  Ill be keelhauled if I can understand how such a trick was done , said Dick . From my experiences on the cattle ranges of Texas , I should say that a seventy-five-foot cast with a riata is a mighty big one , and liable to be successful about once in a hundred times . But heres this swab that lassoed Matt , snaring him the first crack--and throwing from a boats deck and across water , at that!  Then , too , proceeded Glennie , their boat has less noise to it than any craft I ever heard of . It shoved along within seventy-five feet of us--and none of us heard a sound!  I thought I heard a noise , Glennie , returned Matt , and that was what took me aft .  I cant understand how it was done , muttered the ensign .  Veil , anyvays , struck in Carl , id vas done , no madder vedder anypody oondershtands it or nod . Kevit making some guesses aboudt der vay it vas pulled off und look der pitzness skevare in der face . It vas der Chaps--who else vould dry to plow der Grampus oudt oof water ? So vats to be done aboudt it ?  Carls talking sense , fellows , said Matt . Those Japs are against us . We thought we had left them behind , and that we should be able to reach San Francisco before they could make us any trouble , but here they are , going for us harder than ever .  Theyre not using that steamer of theirs , mates , averred Dick .  The steamer might have torpedo tubes , answered Glennie .  Ay , so she might; but she couldnt lie along within seventy-five feet of us without making noise enough to wake the dead . The Sons of the Rising Sun have changed boats--and how have they had time to do that , and reach this part of the coast almost at the same time as ourselves ? Weve plugged right along ever since leaving the strait .  That gives me an idea , said the ensign , and you fellows can take it for what its worth . Our knowledge of the Sons of the Rising Sun is a trifle hazy , but we know them to be a secret organization whose aim is to help Japan . The organization is not sanctioned by the Japanese government , for its members commit deeds which would plunge the nation into war if it sanctioned them . Now , this secret society is probably quite extensive . Perhaps we are not dealing with the branch of it that kept us busy most of the way to the Horn , but with another outfit of the Sons of the Rising Sun that has been laying for us here .  Thats possible , agreed Matt . The question is , shall we put into Lota and try to find out something more regarding our enemies , or keep on to Valparaiso , as we had originally intended ?  Im for putting in at Lota , said Dick . We cant tow that infernal Whitehead all the way to Valparaiso .  It will be just as well to stop there , in my opinion , seconded Glennie . If were dealing with another branch of the Sons of the Rising Sun , perhaps we can get some information about them in Lota .  Meppy , ventured Carl , ve could lay in a sooply oof gasoline in Lota , und vouldnt haf to shdop at Valparaiso , huh ? Dot vould safe dime , und I am gedding hungry for a look at der Unidet Shtates again . Der more I see of odder gountries , der more vat I like my own .  His own! laughed Dick , who , now that Motor Matt had been safely recovered , was feeling in fine fettle . You could tell he was a Yank , just by the way he talks , eh ?  I peen an American mit a Dutch agsent , protested Carl , und I tink so mooch oof der Shdars und Shdripes as anypody . I vould schust as soon shtep on der Pritish lions tail as anyting vat I know .  If you step on the British lions tail , and I find it out , matey , laughed Dick , Ill have you hauled up and fined for cruelty to animals . One of these days Im going to write to the kaiser and tell him about you .  Vat I care for der kaiser ? snorted Carl . He iss a pooty goot feller , aber he aind so big like der Bresident oof der land oof der free und der home oof Modor Matt .  Fine-o! chuckled Dick .  A dandy sentiment , Carl! exclaimed Glennie . What do you think of that , Matt ?  Why , returned Matt , I think that if the lot of us dont stop joshing and attend more to watching our immediate neighborhood that the land of the free and the home of the brave is liable to be minus one submarine and a lot of motor boys . That Jap boat is a particularly noiseless craft; she came close enough to us to launch a torpedo , and close enough to tangle me up in a rope and pull me into the ocean . If she did it once , she can do it again . Weve got to keep sharp eyes forward , aft , and on both sides . Dick , youll be the bow lookout , and Glennie can go aft; you watch the port side , Carl , and Ill watch the starboard . Can you steer for the rest of the night , Speake ? he added to the man in the conning tower .  I guess I can stand this extra duty if you can , Matt , replied Speake , considering what youve been through .  A dip in the ocean and a ride on a torpedo doesnt count , said Matt , dropping his wet clothes down the hatch; its what may happen to us if we dont keep on our guard that bothers me . This boat is going to be delivered at Mare Island , Japs or no Japs .  Und righdt site oop mit care , you bed you! cried Carl , dropping down on the port side of the conning tower . I feel so easy in my mindt as oof I vas alretty pack in der best gountry vat efer vas .  Carl is full of patriotism to-night , mates , observed Dick , from the bow .  I vas dickled pecause Matt is alife und kicking . Dot inshpires me mit batriotic sendiment , und odder feelings oof choy . Be jeerful , eferypody .  Weighing the evidence offered by the torpedo attack , and the snaring and dragging of Matt into the water , had not resulted in bringing out very much that was of importance . It served , however , to emphasize the need of vigilance by developing the resourcefulness and malevolence of a wily foe .  At 4 a . m . the submarine was close to the land lying south of the Bay of Lota , and , as the mist was still too thick to make out the distance and bearing of the coast , Matt thought it advisable to stop the motor and wait for the fog to clear with the sun .  Advantage was taken of this stop to prepare breakfast . While all hands were eating , Gaines and Clackett , who had been at their posts during the exciting occurrences of the night , were duly informed of all that had taken place .  At 6 a . m . the morning was bright enough so that Matt felt they could proceed with safety .  The passage into the Bay of Lota , between the island of Santa Maria and Lavapié Point , is narrow and difficult , abounding with sunken rocks and other hidden dangers that have not been surveyed and charted .  Luck , however , was with the motor boys , and the passage into the bay was succesfully accomplished . Just as the sun broke through the mist and brought out the beauties of the bay , the Grampus nosed her way into it .  On three sides the bay is surrounded by wooded hills , which shelter it in every direction except on the north .  Dowse me , muttered Dick; this coast looks like that of Cornwall and Devonshire , with that red earth , those granite cliffs , and the trees running down to the waters edge . What are those chimneys and all that smoke over there ?  Smelting works and potteries , explained Glennie . They are owned by a woman , Madam Cousiño , one of the richest women in Chili .  The Grampus , being of light draught , was able to go close inshore . Anchor was dropped within a couple of cables length of the wharf . The mud hooks had hardly taken hold before a man in a tawdry blue uniform came off from the shore in a boat . He was rowed by two negroes , and appeared to be very much excited .  When his boat was laid alongside , the official stood up , flourished his arms , and spouted a stream of language . It was Spanish , and came in such a torrent that Matt , who knew something of the lingo , could make nothing of it . Glennie was better versed in the tongue , and listened attentively and with growing concern .  Heres a go , Matt! exclaimed the ensign , as soon as the official paused to catch his breath . This man is the captain of the port , and he has placed us all under arrest .  Arrest ? cried Matt incredulously . What for ?  He says were thieves , and that we have stolen this submarine boat .  Dots aboudt der lasht ting vat I oxpected! muttered Carl . Take der uniform off dot feller , und ve vill find he iss a Son oof der Rising Sun , I bed you . Leds go to der pottom oof der pay und infite him to come down und ged us .     CHAPTER V .  A SURPRISING SITUATION .   Sink me! growled Dick . Heres a rum go , if anybody asks you . Its bobs to sovereigns that those Japs are mixed up in this .  We can very soon convince the captain of the port that hes made a mistake , said Matt quietly . Get your written instructions , Glennie , and well go ashore with him . Theres something queer about this , and it may be a good thing for us to get to the bottom of it .  How aboudt Tick und me ? inquired Carl . Aind ve going along mit you ?  You and Dick and the rest of the crew , Matt answered , will stay here and take care of the Grampus . Somebody will have to do that , you know , Carl . Its fully as important as going ashore and explaining matters to the officials .  Glennie told the captain of the port that he and Matt would go ashore with him and make it plain to everybody that there was a mistake . The ensigns uniform , spick and span and mighty fetching , made a wholesome impression upon the captain of the port .  While Glennie was getting his papers , the port official dropped back alongside the torpedo and examined it with considerable interest . When the ensign reappeared on the submarines deck , the boat was brought back and Matt and Glennie got aboard . In five minutes they had reached the wharf and clambered ashore .  The negroes who had rowed the boat dropped in on each side of the two young Americans , each drawing an old-fashioned pistol that fired with a percussion cap .  Theyre bound were not going to run , laughed Matt .  I dont know , returned Glennie , but Id rather be in front of those old relics when theyre shot off than behind them . I guess a fellow would be safer .  The captain of the port led the way to the Casa de la Administracion of the Señora Cousiño . It was built on the crest of a low rise , and afforded a fine view of the bay . A tall , slim man , who looked like a Frenchman , stood on the steps of the casa surveying the Grampus through a glass . With an expression of disappointment , he lowered the glass and turned toward the captain of the port as he drew near . Then there was French talk and Spanish talk--the tall , slim man using his native tongue , which the Chilian evidently understood , and the Chilian using the Spanish , with which the Frenchman appeared familiar .  Glennie gave strict attention to all that was going on . The finger and whole-arm movements , the hunching of the shoulders , and the shaking and ducking of the heads , accompanied the talk as a sort of pantomime . Matt was highly amused .  A look of astonishment appeared in Glennies face as he listened .  By George! the ensign exclaimed , when the conversation between the Chilian and the Frenchman had died down . Weve jumped into a surprising situation here , Matt , if Ive got this thing right .  What is it , Glennie ? asked Matt .  Well , the Frenchman says that the submarine isnt the boat he thought it was , and that our arrest has been a mistake .  Im glad they found that out without putting us to any trouble . Is there another submarine in these waters ? And has it been stolen ?  Thats where the surprising part comes in . Ill have to talk with these fellows , and ask them a few questions , before I can get the layout clear in my mind .  French and Spanish had formed a part of Glennies education at Annapolis; he reeled off both languages now , first at one and then at the other of the two men , asking questions and receiving voluble replies .  In five minutes he had the situation straightened out to his satisfaction , and sat down on one of the stone steps beside Matt .  The tall man , Matt , said Glennie , is Captain Pons , of Edouard Lavalle et Cie , shipbuilders , of Havre , France . This firm of Lavalle & Co . are builders of submarines , and they recently finished such a craft for the Chilian navy . The boat was brought over on a tramp freighter , and Captain Pons came along to instruct the Chilian officers and crew in the manner of running the submarine , and also to secure a draft for the purchase price .  The submarine was unloaded safely , and was provisioned by Captain Pons for a run to Santiago , where she was to be inspected by the secretary of the navy . Captain Pons was not to get his money from the government until the submarine reached Santiago . The Chilian crew was to come over from Coronel yesterday afternoon , but arrived in the morning , a good twelve hours ahead of time . Captain Pons rowed out with them to the submarine , showed the captain of the crew all over the boat and explained the machinery to him; then , quite unexpectedly , so far as Captain Pons was concerned , the crew grabbed the Frenchman , threw him into the rowboat , closed the hatch of the submarine , and dropped into the bottom of the bay .  Matt was listening with intense interest .  The crew that Captain Pons took out to the submarine wasnt the right one ? he observed .  No . The real crew arrived in the afternoon , agreeably to schedule , and found Captain Pons without a submarine and very much up in the air . If he cant recover the submarine from the thieves , his firm may hold him responsible for the loss of the stolen boat .  There were torpedoes in the French submarine ?  Matt began to grow excited as the situation cleared before him .  Two , replied Glennie .  And the bogus crew--who were they ?  Instead of coming from Coronel , it was discovered that they came from the south--by railroad from Valdivia , on the coast . It has also been discovered that they were Japanese--Japs who had their eyes straightened . It is supposed that they are from the mysterious steamer that escaped from Captain Sandoval , below English Reach .  Matts astonishment almost lifted him off the stone step on which he was sitting .  Our old enemies! he exclaimed . The Sons of the Rising Sun have secured a submarine boat , and that means that they can follow us wherever we go .  Hard luck , Matt , that events should drift into this tangle! That French submarine had to be here , it seems , at just the right time to help out the Japs . The young Samurai must have known about this other craft . After dodging Captain Sandoval , they managed to reach Valdivia and came on from there by train . That is how they were able to get ahead of us .  Every mysterious twist is taken out of the situation now , Glennie , said Matt , almost stunned by the audacity of the Japs and the marvelous way in which circumstances had aided them . They took possesion of the French submarine and started south to meet the Grampus . The noiseless way in which they hung upon our flanks is easy to understand . The torpedo was launched at us while the French boat was submerged; and when that rope was hurled at me , the boat was just out of the water--there were no lights about her , and the search light of the Grampus enabled those on the French craft to make that cast with the riata .  Matts face went pale .  Glennie , he continued , the hardest job of our lives is ahead of us! The Japs have a submarine , and theres not one of them who would not willingly give his life if , by doing so , he could destroy the Grampus . As long as our enemies were in a steamboat , and compelled to remain on the surface , it was easy to keep away from them; but now , no matter where we go , they can follow us .  I dont know anything about this French boat , returned Glennie thoughtfully , but Ill bet something handsome shes not half so good a craft as the Grampus . Theres a big advantage for us , right at the start . Then , again , about the only thing were to fear from the stolen submarine is the torpedo work . Captain Pons says there were only two torpedoes in the craft . One of them is accounted for . They have only one more--and I guess we can get away from that . Besides all this , dont forget that the Japs are green hands with the submarine , and have had no practical experience in running her . Captain Pons explained to them the theoretical part of the machinery , but , you take it from me , those wily Orientals are going to get themselves into trouble .  They manoeuvred the submarine pretty well last night , said Matt . I dont see how they could improve much on their work . A Jap , Glennie , is a regular genius in catching on to things . Show him how to do a piece of work once , and he knows it for all time . Theyre clever--as clever as they are wily , and sometimes treacherous .  At this point , Captain Pons put in a few words .  I see ze torpedo is wiz youar boat , monsieur . You say zat you peek heem out of ze sea , but he is my torpedo , and he is vorth many sousand francs . I am to have him , eh ?  Matt looked at Glennie .  We might need that torpedo , Matt , suggested the ensign , for the Grampus has only one . If it comes to a fight with the French boat that extra Whitehead would come in handy . I think we had better keep it .  So do I , agreed Matt . He turned to Captain Pons . The torpedo was fired at us , captain , he went on , and it was by a happenchance , and at a considerable risk to myself , that I was able to save it and tow it in .  He is mine , by gar! cried the Frenchman .  What good is the torpedo to you without the submarine ?  Ma foi , I can sell heem . I save zat much .  Any way you figure it , insisted Matt , were entitled to salvage on the torpedo .  Nozzing , not one centime! screeched Captain Pons , jumping up and down and flourishing his arms .  Suppose I pay you the difference between the salvage and the cost of the torpedo ? asked Matt , willing to adjust the matter in any way that would secure peace .  Non! I want ze torpedo , and zis talk of ze salvage is wat you call boosh; oui , zat is all , nozzing but boosh .  There seemed no amicable way of settling the dispute . Matt , feeling that the Whitehead was of prime importance to the Grampus , was determined to stick to his contention .  He and Glennie stood up , and all on the steps of the casa turned their eyes downward to where the Grampus lay on the placid waters of the harbor , the long , black cylinder of the Whitehead some forty or fifty feet back of the stern .  While they looked , a most astounding thing happened . The torpedo seemed suddenly to become imbued with life . It shivered , jerked sidewise like an animated log , whirled around frantically , and then , with one end leaping into the air , it darted downward , out of sight!     CHAPTER VI .  ANOTHER ATTACK .   This weird vanishing on the part of the object in dispute between Motor Matt and Captain Pons left those on steps of the Casa gasping . The Frenchman dropped limply down and hugged his folded arms to his breast; the Chilian looked wild , and a superstitious fear arose in the eyes of the two negroes . Glennie grabbed up the glasses the captain had been using a few minutes before , clapped them to his eyes , and proceeded to examine the surface of the bay .  The strange movements of the torpedo had had something of an effect upon the Grampus , for she had swung about on her cable and dipped slightly sternward . She was lying quietly enough now , however , and Carl , Dick , Speake , Gaines , and Clackett were swarming over her deck and evidently wondering what had become of the Whitehead .  Matt , with his naked eyes , could see his friends moving about , although it was impossible for him to discover exactly what they were doing .  Theyre pulling in the rope that was made fast to the torpedo , said Glennie . Theyve got the end of it in their hands .  Great spark plugs! murmured Matt dazedly . That was a queer performance , I must say . Can you see anything of the Whitehead , Glennie ?  Not a thing . There must have been some compressed air still left in the cylinder , and in some way it got to the screws .  Matt shook his head .  Thats not it , Glennie . Even if the Whiteheads screws had begun to work they couldnt have caused the big tube to dance around in that unheard-of fashion . I----  Matt , with a sudden alarming thought running through his mind , started down the steps at a run . The Frenchman shouted something . Taking his cue from Captain Pons , the Chilian also shouted . Probably it was a command for Matt to halt , but the young motorist did not construe it in that way . Pons , himself , had said that there was no cause for the arrest of Matt and Glennie , and Motor Matt believed that he was perfectly free to go wherever he wished . Just then he was tremendously eager to get aboard the Grampus .  One of the old-fashioned pistols went off with a bang like a small cannon . A lead slug screeched through the air well over Matts head .  Come back , Matt! yelled Glennie . If you dont , the next bullet may come closer to you .  Matt faced about indignantly .  What are they shooting at me for ? he demanded .  They dont want you to get away , just yet .  But Ive got to get away! We must get aboard the Grampus as quick as the nation will let us . Cant you understand this business , Glennie ? That French submarine is in the bottom of the bay! The Japs are recovering that torpedo! You know why they want it , as well as I do .  Jupiter! exclaimed Glennie , I hadnt thought of that . But youd better come back here , Matt , while we explain the situation to Captain Pons . Its better to have him and the captain of the port for friends rather than enemies .  Every minutes delay makes the position of the Grampus just that much more dangerous . Carl , Dick , and the rest dont know a thing about this other submarine , and if the Japs made an attack on our boat , while shes lying at anchor----  Dont fret about that , Matt , cut in Glennie . The Japs will have their hands full saving their torpedo . Theyre thinking more about that Whitehead just at present than of anything else . But , anyhow , we cant try to dodge the bullets these negroes will send after us if we make a run of it .  Matt , fretting over the delay , slowly returned to the steps . The negro was reloading his pistol , the other was making ready to use his weapon in case Matt refused to obey orders , and both the captain of the port and Captain Pons were looking extremely fierce and determined .  Both captains were talking to Glennie . The ensign answered them sharply , and the captains gave responses equally sharp .  What a pair of dunderheads! growled Glennie to Matt .  Hows that ? queried Matt .  Captain Pons has developed a very bright idea , was the ensigns sarcastic response . He says we caused the torpedo to act in that unaccountable manner , and that we did it in order to steal it from him .  Matt caught his breath .  Is Captain Pons in his sober senses ? he demanded .  All the senses Heaven endowed him with are on duty .  How does he think we could cause the torpedo to act in that manner ?  He lays it to our friends on the Grampus , but is gloriously indefinite concerning the way they worked the trick .  Matt walked up the steps and faced Captain Pons . We had nothing to do with the disappearance of the torpedo! he cried . Why , the very idea is preposterous! How could any of our men cause the Whitehead to disappear in that fashion ?  You want ze torpedo , insisted Captain Pons doggedly . You make ze dispute wiz me . Zen , wen I say non , ze torpedo belong wiz me , pouf! away he go lak a streak . You haf stole heem , and you will answer to ze French government for zat , by gar!  That is foolish talk , Captain Pons , for a man of your age and experience .  Hein! I am not so foolish as wat you zink .  It was the other boat that stole the torpedo--the submarine the Japs stole from you .  Zat could not be ze Pom . Ze Jap zey would not dar-r-r-e bring ze Pom back in ze bay .  You dont know those Japs as well as we do , captain . They are enemies of ours , and have followed us clear from Port-of-Spain , Trinidad . They want to destroy the Grampus , to keep her out of the hands of the United States Navy . If I dont go down there , and warn my friends and do something to protect our submarine , this Pom of yours may make an attack .  Zis is a friendly port , replied Captain Pons , with a wave of the hand . Ze Japs will not dar-r-r-e make attack in ze friendly port .  Matt was disgusted . He felt that he had never met a man so dense as this Captain Pons .  The Japs stole your submarine in a friendly port , he remarked dryly . I guess that proves that theyre not above committing lawless acts in a Chilian harbor . You have no right to detain Ensign Glennie and myself . We are under the protection of the Stars and Stripes . If you are determined to keep us with you on this ridiculous charge of stealing the torpedo , then will you not accompany us to the Grampus while we take measures for the boats protection ? While there , perhaps we may be able to convince you how foolish this charge of yours is .  Zat is reasonable talk , admitted Captain Pons gravely . I vill spik wiz my good friend , Captain Arco .  Matt and Glennie drew apart while the two captains held a whispered conversation , although a very animated one .  A couple of jumping jacks! muttered Glennie; and blockheads , to boot . I wonder what those French shipbuilders were thinking of to send a man like Captain Pons with their submarine .  Well , he may know all about the submarine , and be perfectly trustworthy , answered Matt .  I wouldnt trust him to drive a pair of mules on a canal .  The ensign was completely disgusted .  Ah! he said , a moment later . The two great minds have at last come to a decision in this momentous matter .  Captains Pons and Arco approached the two lads importantly .  Ze good captain has agreed to go back wiz you and me to ze submarine , announced Captain Pons . If , wen we get zere , you will hand ovair ze torpedo , zen we not make ze trouble for you any more . Allons! let us be gone .  The negroes , following an order from the captain of the port , dropped in on either side of Matt and Glennie , their antiquated pistols prominently displayed . Then , with the two captains leading the way , the American lads left the Casa de la Administracion .  How those Japs managed to get hold of that torpedo without showing themselves , remarked Glennie , on the way to the landing , is a conundrum .  They must have come up under the torpedo , answered Matt , just close enough to the surface to grapple a coil of the rope that was around the steel shell .  Even on that theory the move is hard to understand . While the Pom was under water it would not be possible for any one aboard of her to work at the ropes around the torpedo .  Perhaps the grappling was done by manoeuvring the boat .  That might be----  Glennie was interrupted . By that time the party had nearly reached the landing . Before any of them stepped foot on the wharf , however , there came a loud detonation , and a geyser-like column of water arose high in the air . So lofty was the column that some of the spray from it was hurled across the intervening stretch of the bay and into the faces of Matt , Glennie , and the rest .  When the column had sunk downward , those on the shore could see that the Grampus had disappeared!     CHAPTER VII .  A BAD HALF HOUR .   Matt , Glennie , the two captains , and the negroes were stupefied . They stood as though rooted to the ground and stared across the water toward the spot where the Grampus had been anchored .  Sacre! muttered Captain Pons . Zat was a torpedo , by gar!  It was fired at the Grampus! cried Matt , almost beside himself . I was afraid an attack would be made--and the boys didnt know anything about that other submarine , Glennie . If our boat has been destroyed , if--if----  Matt staggered against the post to which the painter securing the rowboat was made fast .  The negroes began talking excitedly between themselves , and Pons and Arco likewise began to air their opinions .  Dont lose your nerve , Matt , said Glennie . That was a torpedo , all right , and it goes without saying that the Japs discharged it from the Pom , under water . It hit something , and was discharged , but it didnt hit the Grampus .  No , answered Matt , his moody eyes resting on the spot where the Grampus had been anchored , the torpedo didnt hit the Grampus , for the column of water spouted up almost a fathom from the place where she was moored; but the boat may have been destroyed by the explosion , for all that . When the geyser dropped , it covered the place where our submarine ought to have been . But you can see , Glennie , she isnt there .  Motor Matt had gone through many perils and difficulties since he and his chums had started for around the Horn with the Grampus , but he had never been so greatly cast down as he was at that moment . He was thinking of Carl , of Dick , and of the three brave men , Speake , Gaines , and Clackett , who had stood shoulder to shoulder with him through all the dangers that had met them since leaving British Honduras .  It was a good thing that Glennie , at that moment , was so hopeful .  We havent been able to see the Grampus for several minutes , Matt , he observed . In coming down the hill from the casa , the boat was hidden from us .  All the same , Glennie , she was in her berth , whether we saw her or not . If she hadnt been where we left her , the Japs wouldnt have had any target , and the torpedo would not have been exploded in that spot . If it comes to that , the fact that we didnt see her goes to show that she may have changed her position a little , and have been right where the torpedo exploded .  I dont think that for a minute , averred Glennie stoutly . The last we saw of the Grampus all our friends were on deck . If she had been torpedoed , wed certainly see some of the boys in the water . They were under hatches when that Whitehead went off; and , if they were under hatches , they may have been safe . Im inclined to think they were .  If the bottom plates of the submarine were blown in , proceeded Matt , she would sink and go down like so much lead . Lets get into the boat and row out , Glennie . We can see a good deal more if were right over the spot where the Grampus was anchored than we can from here .  Matt , suiting his action to the word , dropped hastily over the edge of the wharf and into the boat . The wharf was in a bad state of repair . The planks had been torn from the piles , and a region of semi-darkness stretched away under the floor .  As Matt dropped into the boat , his face was turned landward and his eyes rested for a moment on the gloom that lay between the outer piles and the shore; but , during that moment , he glimpsed something that gave him a start . Unless he was greatly mistaken , he could make out the dim shape of a human form crouching in the darkness .  Cast off the painter , Glennie , quick! he called .  The ensign lifted the loop over the top of the post and flung it into the boat .  Grabbing the wharf planks , Matt gave a pull that sent the boat in between the piles . He could hear shouts of wild suspicion coming from Captain Pons and Captain Arco . Unable to figure out what impelled Matt to vanish under the wharf , they jumped to the conclusion that he was doing something he ought not to do .  Paying no attention to the frantic voices , or the frenzied tramping on the planks overhead , the young motorist continued to drag the boat onward toward the shore . Several yards back from the edge of the wharf , the bow of the boat struck against a timber that had one end imbedded in the sand , while the other end rose upward , clear of the water .  The human form Matt had seen was lying upon the timber . The man made no move to escape , or to protect himself , and Matt was not long in discovering that he was either dead or unconscious .  For a moment Matts heart was in his throat . His fears , even against his better judgment , made him apprehensive that this form , lying helplessly on the timber under the wharf , might be that of one of his friends .  Close examination , however , proved his fears groundless . The man was under medium height and had a tawny skin . He was barefooted , bareheaded , and stripped to his waist . Rolling him into the boat , Matt drew the light craft back into the daylight at the edge of the wharf .  What under the canopy are you about , Matt ? called Glennie , from the edge of the wharf . Then , seeing the man in the bottom of the boat , he gave vent to an astonished whistle . Thats what you went under the wharf for , eh ? Where was that fellow ?  He was lying on a timber , just out of the water , answered Matt . The question is , where did he come from , and what was he doing there ?  He looks as though he was stripped for swimming .  And he worked so hard in the water , and in getting ashore , that he gave out and lost consciousness as soon as he pulled himself upon that timber . The fact that he was under the wharf proves that he didnt want anybody to find him . Hes a Jap , Glennie .  A yell escaped Captain Pons , and he began talking excitedly and pointing his finger at the Jap .  What does Pons say , Glennie ? Matt asked .  He says that that fellow was one of the men who stole the Pom . The captain is very sure he is not mistaken . There were five in the party .  Gif the r-r-rascal here! cried Captain Pons , stretching his arms downward , gif heem to me! By gar , he is one of ze tieves--ve haf captured one of ze tieves!  Matt lifted the unconscious man , and three pairs of hands caught him from above and pulled him up on the wharf . Hardly had the Jap touched the planks than , with amazing suddenness , he jumped to his feet and tried to run .  He was shamming! exclaimed Glennie .  No , answered Matt , as the two negroes deftly caught the fleeing Jap and flung him roughly down on his back , Im positive he was not shamming , Glennie . He recovered while we were lifting him to the wharf and thought he could make a bolt and get away .  As the two negroes held the prisoner down on the planks , Captain Pons stepped to his side , bent over , and shook a fist in his face .  What the captain said was in Spanish , which he probably used for the Japs benefit , and Matt could not follow his words further than to be sure that Pons was threatening and reviling the man for the treacherous part he and his countrymen had played .  The prisoner looked up calmly into the Frenchmans face , seeming to take his capture and his failure to escape as a matter of course .  We get the torpedo , said he , in good English , the moment Captain Pons ceased talking .  How did you get the torpedo ? queried Glennie , pushing the captain aside and drawing closer to the prisoner .  I volunteered , went on the Jap , a note of ringing exultation in his low voice; they passed me through the torpedo tube , and I cut the cable that secured the torpedo to the other submarine , and made a rope fast from our boat . It was hard work , all under water . Then I swim ashore , but I am weak and faint and try to hide . You have captured me . Do what you will . Banzai , Nippon!  The Chilian could not understand English , and he was consumed with curiosity . Captain Pons understood , however , and the calmness of the prisoner , during his brief recital , filled him with rage . He tried to strike the Jap , but Glennie interfered .  Let him alone , Pons! cried Glennie . He thinks he has done right . Anyhow , hes a prisoner , and a prisoner should not be mistreated .  Diable! ground out the captain . He make ze brag zat he steal ze torpedo! S-scoundr-r-el! He should be hang , by gar!  Glennie turned to Motor Matt .  You heard , Matt ? he queried . The Japs passed this fellow out through the torpedo tube of the Pom while the boat was under water . He made a line fast , cut the cable securing the torpedo to our submarine , and then swam ashore . A rare piece of work!  Ask him about that torpedo attack on the Grampus , said Matt . See if you can find out anything about the intentions of the other Japs .  You are one of the Sons of the Rising Sun ? queried Glennie , again addressing the prisoner .  A gleam darted through the Japs eyes .  I say nothing , he answered . I have told about the torpedo . But I tell you nothing more . It is all for Nippon , for my beloved country .  Thats the way with those fellows , said Matt disappointedly . He wouldnt speak another word even if he was tortured . Im surprised that he said what he did about the torpedo . Turn him over to Pons and the captain of the port , Glennie , and lets row out into the bay and see if we can learn anything about the fate of the Grampus .  Matts face was haggard with fear and anxiety . He had had a bad half hour , since the explosion of the torpedo and the disappearance of the Grampus , and his face reflected the intensity of his feelings .  Glennie turned away from the prisoner and stepped to the edge of the wharf . He paused there for a moment , rigid as a statue , his eyes wandering over the surface of the bay .  Motor Matt , wondering at his manner , likewise directed his gaze off over the water . As he did so , Glennie recovered his wits abruptly and gave vent to an exultant yell .  Hurrah! he roared , jerking off his cap and waving it . Whats the matter with the motor boys , Matt ? Weve had our worry all for nothing!     CHAPTER VIII .  CHASING A TORPEDO .   Dick and Carl , together with the rest of the crew of the Grampus , did a lot of guessing after Matt and Glennie left them with the captain of the port .  The commotion kicked up by the torpedo put a sudden and effectual stop to their speculations . Carl , Dick , and Speake were on deck when the Whitehead began its peculiar performance , and the jerks administered to the Grampus by the tow line quickly brought Gaines and Clackett up through the tower hatch .  Ach , du lieber! cried Carl . See vonce vat has habbened mit der dorpeto . A vale has got dangled oop mit der tow line; oder oof id dond vas a vale id vas a shark , und a pig feller , I bed you . Vat a funny pitzness! From der actions , id looks like der dorpeto vas alife .  Whale! scoffed Dick . Dont you believe that a whale , or shark , either , has got anything to do with that .  Vat it iss , den ?  I give it up . What do you think , Speake ?  Ask me something easy , answered Speake . Mebby something has got loose inside the torpedo--compressed air , or something--and that that is whats putting the big tube through its jig .  Leds pull in der line , suggested Carl , und make der dorpeto pehave .  Not on your life! cried Dick . Its full of dynamite , and Ill never let the Grampus get any closer to that infernal machine than she is now .  Matt vants dot dorpeto or he vouldnt haf taken der drouple to tow her in .  Matt can have it , matey , but I dont intend to board a Whitehead when its dancing a hornpipe . If the dynamite should happen to let go----  Dick was interrupted by a chorus of surprised yells from the rest of his companions .  The torpedo , kicking one end high in the air , had taken a header toward the bottom of the bay .  Dot means goot-by , murmured the amazed Carl . Der vales run off mit it . Bedder dot vale look a leedle oudt und not knock his tail too hardt against der dorpeto . Oof he do dot , den , py shinks , he make some mincemeat out oof himseluf .  Great guns! exclaimed Gaines . What do you suppose did that , Dick ?  More mysterious things have happened to us since we left Magellan Strait , ruminated Dick , than ever came our way before . Suppose we haul in on the tow line and have a look at the end of it .  The line was pulled aboard . There were some forty feet of it , and the end was sliced off clean .  A knife did that! declared Clackett .  Der vale dit id mit his teet , asserted Carl , who always hung to one of his own theories like a dog to a bone .  Bosh , Clackett! scoffed Gaines . How could a knife have done that ? Who was down there to cut the rope ?  It dont make any difference what separated the rope , put in Speake , the thing was done , and something or other is running away with Motor Matts torpedo . Matt must have wanted that Whitehead or he wouldnt have gone to the trouble to tow it in . Are we going to let it get away from us ?  How can we help it ? inquired Clackett .  We can follow it , asserted Speake .  We havent any business taking the Grampus from her anchorage while Matts ashore , said Gaines .  I guess Matt wouldnt mind if we took a dive along the bottom of the bay to overhaul that runaway torpedo , remarked Dick .  Sure , nod! chimed in Carl . Matt vill be as madt as some vet hens ven ve tell him der dorpeto skyhooted avay mit itseluf und ve ditnt do nodding to shdop id .  Well chance it , anyway , mates , said Dick . Im always in command whenever our old raggie is off the boat . Get down to the motor , Gaines . Clackett , get after the tanks . Come below , the rest of you , and let the last man down secure the hatch .  Speake was the last one to drop down the hatch . The ballast tanks were already filling as he stepped off the iron ladder upon the floor of the periscope room .  Dick was at the wheel .  Turn on the electric projector , Speake , said Dick . Im going up into the tower and do the steering from there .  Dick got just two rounds up the ladder when a muffled roar enveloped the Grampus , and she was heaved violently over until the tower was almost on a level with her keel .  Carl , who had been inspecting the periscope , was thrown violently against the rounded wall over the locker . Speake , just reaching up to turn the electric switch that sent a current through the wires of the projector , went head over heels against one of the bulkheads . As for Dick , he pulled off a remarkable stunt at ground and lofty tumbling , winding up with his head under the periscope table and his heels in the air .  Yells came in muffled volume from below , proving that Gaines and Clackett were likewise having their troubles .  The Grampus righted herself almost as quickly as she had flopped over . This , taking place before those aboard had had a chance to adjust themselves , still further complicated matters .  When every one was finally right side up , Dick jumped to the speaking tubes .  How are you down there , Gaines ? he called .  I turned a handspring over the motor , came back the voice of Gaines , but I guess I didnt damage anything .  I stood on my head in one of the accumulators , added Clackett through the tank-room tube . We turned turtle there for about half a minute . What caused it , Dick ? I heard an explosion , too .  That bally old torpedo must have gone off , answered Dick . No use hunting for it now .  I dont believe it was that torpedo that exploded , said Speake . What could have set it off ?  Der vale shlowed oop a leedle , explained Carl , und id run indo him . I bed you someting for nodding dere iss vale all ofer der pay .  Were in luck , anyhow , exulted Dick . This old flugee is as trim and steady as ever . Now that were down near the bottom well cruise a little and see what we can discover . Weve got an hour or two , I guess , before Matt and Glennie get back to the landing and want to come aboard . Slow speed , Gaines , he called .  Hurrying up into the conning tower , Dick pressed his eyes against the forward lunettes . The trail of light , reaching out through the lunette , illuminated the murky waters for several yards beyond the point of the submarines bow .  There was a commotion in the depths , and fishes were darting in all directions .  Steering from the ladder , Dick headed the Grampus toward the north . They had not gone far before Dick saw something which made him rub his eyes .  Am I doing a calk , he muttered , or are these lamps of mine making a monkeys fist of their work ? Strike me lucky! Carl! Look into the periscope!  A vague shape was passing through the gleam of the search light . It looked like a huge cigar , its pointed end tilted slightly upward . At the rear of the object there was a flurry of water .  Ids a vale! boomed Carl , whose mind seemed to be running on whales that day .  Its another submarine , gasped Speake , thats what it is . I wonder if Matt didnt know there was another submarine in these waters ?  Watch! cried Dick excitedly . Whats that behind the thing ?  The other boat was moving in a course that angled slightly with the direction the Grampus was following . Because of this the second craft was some time in passing through the glow of the search light .  As Dick called out , those at the periscope table saw the Whitehead torpedo glide into the gleam from the electric projector . A rope held the forward end of the torpedo to the stern of the other submarine , the buoyancy of the steel cylinder causing its rear part to stand almost straight up in the water .  It was an odd procession the boat and the torpedo made as they defiled through the pencil of light .  Dots der feller vat shtole Matts dorpeto! cried Carl . Run against der rope , Tick , und preak der dorpeto loose .  Not much , I wont , matey , breathed Dick . Were not going to take any chances with that Whitehead .  It certainly wasnt that torpedo that went off , a little while ago , Dick , observed Speake .  Right-o , Dick answered , startled by the thought this remark of Speakes had aroused . It was a torpedo , though , and that other craft must have launched it at us .  Ach , himmelblitzen! gasped Carl . For vy should dot odder poat shoot some dorpetos ad us , hey ?  Give it up , Carl , unless there are some of those Sons of the Rising Sun aboard .  Dick slid down the ladder in a hurry .  Empty the tanks , Clackett! he sang out . Weve got to hustle out of this , he added to Carl and Speake , before they shoot another Whitehead at us . Keelhaul me , but this will be news for Matt . Weve got to tell him about it as soon as ever we can get the Grampus back to her old berth .  Two minutes later the submarine lifted her turtle-like back out of the waves . Dick headed her south , and Carl and Speake pushed open the hatch and went out on the wet plates . Dick ascended the ladder to steer from the hatch . Hardly had he got head and shoulders into the outside air when a shout from Carl and Speake drew his eyes toward the wharf .  Matt and Glennie , and a few more the boys did not know , were on the landing . Glennie was yelling and waving his cap .  Vats der madder mit him , I vonder ? queried Carl . He vouldnt be doing dot oof he knowed aboudt dot odder poat und der dorpeto .     CHAPTER IX .  NORTHWARD BOUND .   The Grampus had no more than dropped anchor in her old berth than Matt , Glennie , Captain Pons , the captain of the port , and the negroes were alongside in the boat .  Great spark plugs , cried Matt , but you fellows gave me a scare .  Vell , bard , answered Carl , ve vas a leedle schared ourselufs .  Heres another scare for you , matey , called Dick . The Sons of the Rising Sun have a submarine of their own , and are after us . They were here , off Lota , and just went north with that torpedo in tow .  Jupiter! exclaimed Glennie . How did you fellows know that ?  You act as though it wasnt any news to you .  It isnt , but we thought you fellows were not informed and would fall a victim to the Pom .  Pom ? echoed Dick .  Thats the name of the other submarine , went on Matt . Shes a French craft and was brought here by this man , Captain Pons , to be turned over to the Chilian government . Five Japs worked a trick and succeeded in getting hold of her .  Why , how----  Well tell you all about it later , Dick . Where were you when that torpedo went off ?  Just diving to the bottom to go hunting for the other torpedo . That Whitehead they fired never touched us .  It must have touched something , put in Speake , or the firing pin wouldnt have got in its work .  It hit a harbor buoy , said Matt . At least , the captain of the port says there was a buoy at this point . As it isnt here now , it must have been demolished . Its a lucky thing for all of us that the buoy was between the Grampus and the Whitehead . Glennie and I will go back to the shore , Dick , and get a barrel of gasoline . You get the hose rigged and have everything ready to discharge the gasoline in short order . Were northward bound , and are going to get away from these waters just as quick as the nation will let us .  There was something of a disappointment in this for the men on the submarine . They had hoped for a chance to stretch their legs ashore , but they appreciated the necessity of getting the Grampus out of harms way as quickly as possible .  Wont the Pom lay for us as we pull out of the bay , Matt ? asked Dick .  She cant lay for us . You see , she had only two torpedoes . One of those was destroyed in the attack made on the Grampus in the bay; the other one the Pom is dragging off to some place where she can get it in shape for work . We need not fear any attack from the Sons of the Rising Sun until the other Whitehead is ready for use . If we act quickly , we can get well away from the Pom before she becomes dangerous .  Diable! rasped out Captain Pons . Is it ze American vay to r-run from ze enemy ? Pur-r-r-soo and capture , zat is ze sing . I will go wiz you , oui , I , myself , Captain Pons . You will help me get back ze Pom . Eh ?  Were not here to take any risks with the Grampus , captain , said Matt . Responsibility for the safety of the boat rests on my shoulders , and youll have to get some Chilian war ship to help you .  Zat is not right! cried the captain . One mariner is in ze duty bound to help anozzer mariner in ze distress . Me , I call on you . You refuse , zen zat is mos contemptible .  Im sorry you look at it in that way , captain , replied Matt; but its just possible I know my own business better than you do .  Captain Pons had a little fit all by himself , and while he had it he was saying unpleasant things .  Whats the matter with the frog eater ? cried Dick . Throw him overboard!  Matt signed for the captain of the port to have the negro oarsmen get the boat back to the landing . The captain at once gave the order and the boat danced away in the direction of the wharf .  Captain Pons was still calling down anathemas on the heads of all Americans who refused to help a Frenchman in ze distress .  By gar , he cried , I vill vire my government how you haf treat me! I vill use ze cable , and let ze president of my country know it all . It is mos contemptible!  Captain , said Matt , we are not allowed to take any strangers aboard the Grampus . Our submarine has appliances which put her so far ahead of every other boat in her class that we are all under seal of secrecy and are bound by a pledge to keep strangers away . So , you see , it would be impossible for you to take a cruise in the Grampus .  Captain Pons glared .  It is mos contemptible! was all he could say .  Matt and Glennie , without delaying further , pushed into the town . Matt had little difficulty in finding the gasoline he wanted . He had to go to two or three places before he found fuel that answered the severe tests he put it to , but finally he got what he desired and had it hauled to the landing .  The captain of the port was not in evidence , but his two negroes were waiting at the boat .  Matt had come down to the wharf in the wagon that brought the gasoline , and Glennie had been left to follow on foot . The ensign put in an appearance just as the barrel had been transferred to the boat . Matt was surprised to see him carrying a rifle .  The only firearms aboard the Grampus consisted of a six-shooter which had accompanied the ensign when he first assumed his duties on the submarine .  What are you going to do with that , Glennie ? laughed Matt . Shoot Japs ?  Well , no , not exactly , answered Glennie , There are a good many ways in which a weapon of this sort might come in handy , besides using it for shooting Japs . Its an American gun , Matt--a Marlin . It looked sort of homelike , so I just took it in , along with a box of cartridges .  If Matt hated one thing more than another , it was a gun . He had seen firearms used so recklessly while he was in the Southwest that he had acquired a strong prejudice against them . Notwithstanding this fact , he was a crack shot , and had more than once carried off the prize in a shooting contest .  All right , Glennie , said he , although a trifle reluctantly , bring it along .  You dont like guns , Matt , observed the ensign as he lowered himself into the boat and dropped down on one of the thwarts .  Or knives , either , added Matt , when they are used to get the better of another fellow . A pair of fists make pretty good weapons .  Fists are all right , laughed Glennie , so long as the other chap uses them; but when you find an enemy standing off forty or fifty feet and looking at you over the sights of a gun--well , thats the time another gun would be mighty valuable .  By the time the small boat fell in alongside the Grampus , Dick , Carl , and the rest had the hose ready and it took only a few moments to rig the pump . Presently the gasoline was flowing down the tower hatch and into the reservoir below .  Dick , keeping one eye on the negroes while they bent over the pump handles , leaned against the conning tower and heaved a long breath .  Im hoping , old ship , said he to Matt , that well be able to leave the Japs behind , this time , for good and all . Those on the Pom must have seen us while we had their craft under our search light , and I guessed good and hard why they didnt turn and send another torpedo at us . I didnt know , you see , that they only had two Whiteheads to their blessed name . We could have pulled their fangs if we had opened up that torpedo and took out the dynamite .  I intended , answered Matt , to take the torpedo aboard through one of our tubes as soon as we reached this harbor , but the captain of the port came down on us before I had the chance .  How did you find out about that submarine , and the Japs being in charge of her ?  Matt straightened out this point to his chums satisfaction . That part of Matts recital which had to do with the Jap who had been captured under the wharf was particularly interesting to Dick .  Those fellows dont care a rap for their own lives , muttered Dick , and thats what makes em such nasty fighters . When that fellow got out through the Poms torpedo tube , he must have come up directly under the Whitehead . By hugging the torpedo close , he could have got his head out of water without any of us on the Grampus seeing him . But he took long chances , just the same , and there are only four Japs left to navigate the other craft . The work probably calls for all hands , and theres bound to be a time when the Pom cant run for lack of hands to navigate her . The Japs are only human , and theyll have to have a spell of rest like every one else .  Weve got a good chance to show them our heels , said Matt , and its our duty to make the most of it .  Im a Fiji , though , said Dick , if I dont hate to run away from those Sons of the Rising Sun . It looks as though the United States and Great Britain had struck their colors to the yellow rascals .  I feel the same way , Dick , but this submarine is worth a hundred thousand dollars , and were only her trustees . Its our duty not to take any chances with her .  Right-o , matey . I understand that just as well as you do . Captain Nemo , Jr . , ought to give you a good slice of that hundred thousand when you tie up the Grampus at the navy-yard wharf .  Im not looking for that , Dick , returned Motor Matt earnestly . Its the idea of making good that appeals to me beyond anything and everything else . It isnt so much the money that comes to us for what we do , but the way we toe the scratch that counts .  An hour later all preliminaries were finished and the Grampus was off up the bay , tanks emptied and steel hull high in the water , her motors humming and setting a record pace .     CHAPTER X .  A HALT FOR REPAIRS .   Late in the afternoon of the day they left Lota Bay the Grampus spoke the British ship Sovereign , bound from Santiago to Liverpool . By means of a megaphone , Matt had a brief talk with the captain of the sailing vessel .  What craft is that ? inquired the British captain , after answering Matts hail with information concerning his own vessel .  The submarine Grampus , answered Matt , six weeks out from Belize , British Honduras , and bound for San Francisco .  My word! came from the other megaphone . Sure about that ?  Matt was stumped . It was certainly an odd question to ask .  Of course Im sure of it . Why ?  Well , we passed another submarine , two hours ago , and she was towing a torpedo . Said she had discharged it at a target and was going to beach it somewhere , and get it in shape for further use . But the bally joke of it is that the captain of that other submarine said that his boat was the United States submarine Grampus . Its a main queer go if there are two submarines of that name both belonging to the United States Government .  Well , what do you think of that ? muttered Glennie , leaning out of the hatch . The nerve of it!  That other boat was the Pom , called back Matt , sent over to Chili by a firm of French shipbuilders . She was stolen from the harbor of Lota by a handful of Japs .  Fancy that! Those Japs are----  The rest of it Matt could not hear . The two boats had merely spoken each other in passing and were quickly out of reach of each others megaphones .  Those Sons of the Rising Sun are stealing our thunder , remarked Glennie .  I suppose , returned Matt , that its a heap safer for the Japs to call their boat the Grampus than the Pom . If they happened to speak a vessel that knew of the stealing of the Pom results might prove disastrous if they told the truth .  Matt descended to the periscope room to give the news to Carl and Dick .  Dots der vorst yet! grunted Carl . Der itee oof dem Chaps calling deir old frog-eader poat der Grampus! I dond like dot . Id vas some insulds .  I guess we can stand it , Carl , said Matt .  Did Pons tell you anything about that French submarine , matey ? inquired Dick .  A little , but not as much as I would have liked to learn . The Pom , I infer , is smaller than the Grampus , and is propelled by electricity when submerged and by gasoline on the surface . Shes only able to stay under water an hour . Captain Nemo , Jr . , could teach those French builders a trick or two with his patent submerged exhausts .  Hows her diving ? Cant she remain submerged longer than an hour with her ballast tanks full and her electric motor quiet ?  No . Her rudders keep her below the surface , and the diving rudders wont work unless her motors going .  She dond amoundt to mooch , oof dots der case , commented Carl . Der Grampus has got der Pom shkinned bot vays for Suntay . I bed you someting for nodding der Pom couldnt have come aroundt der bottom end oof Sout America like vat ve dit . Pom! She vas vat der French fellers call a pomme de terre , by vich , ven I so expression meinseluf , I mean a botato . Whoosh! and the Dutch boy gave a grunt of disgust .  The night fell clear and bright . It was Matts intention to continue running during the night , but submerged so that only the periscope ball was awash .  When the time came to fill the ballast tanks , however , an unexpected difficulty presented itself--a difficulty which had almost brought overwhelming disaster once before , when the Grampus had just emerged from Magellan Strait: the Kingston valves by mean of which the tanks were operated failed to work .  This was no particular fault of the valves , but of some damage that had been done to them , and which caused them to go wrong occasionally--and usually at the most inopportune times .  Matt had made up his mind that new valves would have to be put in , but that was a job which would necessarily have to wait until the submarine reached the end of her long journey .  Repairing the valves would take several hours , and Matt decided to stay on the surface and put in a little bay on Quiriquina Island .  It was not necessary to reach the island before morning and when Dick relieved Gaines at the motor , a call for half speed went through the speaking tube to the motor room .  The young motorist studied his charts , then , with the surroundings of the islands clearly in mind , took the steering wheel himself and laid his course by compass .  It was about five oclock in the morning when the Grampus rounded a bluff headland and took a due east course across Tona Bay . Quiriquina Island loomed up clear and distinct against the gray dawn hovering in the eastern skies .  The cove which Matt selected as a berth for the submarine while repairs were being made had a sloping beach of white sand . It was virtually a bay within a bay , and the waters were as calm as those of an inland lake .  As soon as the anchors were down , all hands came on deck to get a whiff of the morning air .  Wed better have breakfast before we tackle the valves , hadnt we , Matt ? inquired Speake . I know I can work better on a full stomach , and I suppose the rest of you can .  Good idea , Speake , returned Matt . I had thought about that , but supposed you would like to loaf a little and not pen yourself up in the torpedo room with an electric stove .  Those confounded valves bother me , grumbled Speake , and I couldnt loaf and enjoy myself if I had to think about them .  They bother me , too , added Glennie , and I believe Ill go below and look them over .  Ill go with you , said Clackett . We can make a preliminary survey and then get busy right after breakfast . Plenty of chance to loaf during my watch below .  Glad to see you fellows so industrious , laughed Matt . Perhaps , if you are real smart , you can get those valves fixed by breakfast time , and the rest of us wont have to tinker with them .  Youll be needed , Matt , when it comes to the fixing , answered Glennie , as he climbed into the conning tower .  Clackett followed him .  I guess Ill go down , too , yawned Gaines , and catch forty winks on top of the periscope-room locker . This morning air is fine , but Im satisfied to take my share through the open hatch .  He followed Clackett into the tower . Dick , descending to the edge of the rounded deck , peered into the clear depths of the water below .  I can see our cable , mates , said he , and our anchor with one fluke in the sand . Come on , Carl . Lets take a swim before breakfast .  Nod me , Tick , answered Carl . I feel like loafing , und shvimming iss too mooch like vork .  How about you , Matt ?  I feel as Carl does , said Matt . Take your swim if you want to , Dick , and Carl and I will be the anchor watch .  Dick was out of his clothes in a jiffy . So long , he called , as he took a header from the bow of the boat .  He was perfectly at home in the water , and when Matt saw him swimming out toward a headland that walled in the cove on the south , he thought little of it . When he saw that Dick was intending to swim around the point , however , he stood up and called out a warning . But Dick only laughed and kept on until he was out of sight .  He vont go so far dot he cant ged pack again , remarked Carl . He iss like a fish , Tick iss , und he feels pedder in der vater as oudt oof id .  Carl , for some days , had been wearing an outfit of sailor togs which he had found in the slop chest of the submarine . He was trying to be as nautical as possible , so that he could shiver his timbers and dash his deadeyes with the best of them when the Grampus reached San Francisco .  I can valk like a sailor , remarked Carl , getting up from his seat by the tower , und aboudt all I lack now iss to be aple to hitch oop my drousers like vat a sailor does . How iss der vay oof it , Matt ?  Never mind that part of it , Carl , laughed Matt . Youll be enough of a sailor at the end of this cruise , even if you dont know how to hitch up your trousers . Besides , and Matt squinted at him critically , I doubt if you could ever do the trick .  For vy nod ?  Why , the trousers are too tight a fit around the waist .  Yah , so , aber deyre so pig a fit oop und down dot I valk on der pottoms , und id iss eider hitch dem oop oder cut dem off . Now , vatch . Meppy id goes like dis .  Carl jumped into the air , grapped the band of the trousers with one hand in front and the other behind , and kicked out his legs . When he came down , his feet were so far apart that they slipped on the rounded plates , and he went down and rolled over and over . Matt grabbed him just in the nick of time to keep him out of the water .  Look out , warned Matt , or youll take a swim whether you want to or not .  I guess dot I leaf der hitching pitzness oudt , said the chagrined Carl , aber id vas so bicturesque dot I vish I could manach id . Now , ven I----  Carl was interrupted by a shout , wafted toward them from across the cove . He and Matt started up and saw Dick swimming in their direction with all his might .  Whats the matter , Dick ? called Matt .  Sharks! came back the breathless answer .  Matt was no more than a second making up his mind what he should do . To help Dick by bringing the Grampus closer to him was out of the question--disaster might overtake the young sailor before the anchor could be lifted from the bottom .  Ach , himmelblitzen! murmured Carl fearfully . Vat ve going to do , Matt ?  Below with you , quick! flung back the king of the motor boys . Glennies rifle is in the periscope room . Get that and a coil of rope and hustle back here .  Carl , shaking with excitement , hurried to carry out the order . As he vanished into the tower , Matt went forward toward the bow of the boat , keeping his keen eyes on Dick .     CHAPTER XI .  DICK MAKES A DISCOVERY .   The ability of the king of the motor boys to keep his head in trying situations had more than once turned the tide for himself and his chums . Matt could become as excited as anybody , but excitement never interfered with the steadiness of his nerves or with his ability to think quickly and resourcefully in time of danger .  Far beyond Dick Matt could see a black , triangular fin slitting the water , tacking this way and that , but coming closer and closer to the young sailor .  Dick was swimming rapidly , but the shark , of course , was cutting through the water at a much faster gait . Had the shark laid a straight course for its intended victim , the latter would long since have been overtaken .  With a keen eye Motor Matt made a quick estimate of the distance separating Dick and the shark from the boat . He concluded that Dick could not by any possibility reach the Grampus before the shark would be upon him , but the sea scavenger would be close enough for a good shot .  Carl , in a veritable tremor of excitement , rolled over the top of the conning tower with the rifle in one hand and a coil of rope in the other .  Dond led dot shark ged avay mit Tick , he pleaded , handing the rifle to Matt . Pud a pullet righdt indo dot shark , Matt , mitoudt vaiting any longer as bossiple .  Ive got to wait until I can get a good shot , Carl , answered Matt , and that time will come when the shark goes over on its back .  Ven id does dot , quavered Carl , id iss retty to bite . Oof you make a miss , Matt , id iss all ofer mit Tick .  Ill not make a miss . Get a clamp on your nerves and be ready to throw the rope as soon as Dick comes near enough .  My teet chatter a leedle , whimpered Carl , aber my nerfs iss all righdt . Dond you be afraidt pecause I am , Tick , he cried . Schvim like der Olt Poy vas afder you!  Dick had need of all his breath and could not waste any in useless words . He was coming through the water at a fierce clip , his arms working like piston rods in a fine , steady , overhand stroke . He could see Matt on the deck with the rifle ready , and he knew that whatever the king of the motor boys could do would be done .  Ach , shood , shood! implored Carl , watching the black fin zigzagging nearer and nearer . Dond vait , Matt!  But Matt paid no attention to Carl . He knew what kind of a target he wanted , and that the shark would give it to him if he waited .  When Dick was about a dozen feet from the boat , the right moment came . With a flip of its tail the shark leaped partly out of the water and turned on its back , its great jaws opening .  Matt had braced himself firmly and lifted the Marlin repeater to his shoulder .  Fire avay , kevick! clamored Carl , and just then Matt pulled the trigger .  It was a bulls-eye hit . Straight to its mark leaped the murderous bit of lead , and the shark , stunned by the impact of the bullet , snapped its jaws harmlessly together and sank downward in the reddening water .  Youre all right , Dick! cried Matt . Toss the rope , Carl .  Carl threw the line and Dick laid hold of it . The report of the rifle brought Gaines from the periscope room , Glennie and Clackett from the tank room , and Speake from the torpedo room in short order . All of them were on the deck just as Matt and Carl assisted Dick out of the water .  Whats the rumpus ? inquired Gaines .  Matt pointed to the shark , which was floating , belly up , on the water .  Your rifle did it , Glennie , said Matt . If it hadnt been for that , nothing could have saved Dick . I didnt think there was a shark within miles of us when Dick went into the water .  Dick was nearly fagged . The tremendous exertion he had put forth had tried him severely .  It was foolish of me to go around that point , said Dick , leaning back against the conning tower , but Im glad I did .  Dots funny , returned Carl . Glad you vent aroundt der point und shdirred oop dot shark! How you make dot oudt ?  Well , I made a discovery , went on Dick . If I hadnt made that discovery , like enough Id have kept on swimming and have got so far away the shark would surely have nipped me before I could have got back close enough for Matt to shoot .  What was the discovery ? asked Glennie .  Theres another cove around the point , a good deal like this one . The Pom is there , close inshore , and----  Der Chaps! breathed Carl , thunderstruck .  The Pom! exclaimed Glennie .  Heres a piece of luck! ground out Gaines . Whod have thought wed moor ship alongside the same island picked out by the Japs! There seems to be a fatality about our dealings with these Sons of the Rising Sun . Even after we dodge them we have the knack of dropping right into their hands again .  Mebby , suggested Speake , they saw us and followed us to the island .  Hardly that , mate , spoke up Dick . Theyve beached that torpedo , and all four of the Japs are ashore , tinkering with it .  Matt was puzzled to know what to do . If the Japs had not heard the rifle shot , it would be possible for the Grampus to haul in her anchor and slip away , unnoticed , providing the tank valves were repaired and she could leave the bay under water . But this manoeuvre would leave a threatening danger behind , and Matt and his friend would never feel safe from an unexpected attack .  In that critical moment , Motor Matt would have given a deal if he could have known all about the Pom and her capabilities . For a few moments he stood on the deck , turning the situation over and over in his mind , his eyes on the point around which lay the hostile submarine .  How far is the Pom anchored off the shore , Dick ? he asked .  Not more than half a cables length .  Do you think the Japs saw you ?  Im sure they didnt--they were too busy with that torpedo . But they may have heard me yell , or the report of that gun may have reached them . They have good ears , those fellows .  Get into your clothes , Dick , said Matt , having at last made up his mind as to what he should do . After that , take the rifle and sit here on the deck . Watch that point of land . If the Japs fix that torpedo so they are able to use it , they will have to come around the point in order to launch it at us . Finish getting the breakfast , Speake . Gaines will pass it around as soon as you have it ready . Clackett and I will go below and see what we can do with those valves . Dont bother us with any breakfast until we have them once more in working order .  What are Carl and I to do , Matt ? inquired Glennie .  Stay up here with Dick , and keep your eyes peeled .  Matt , Clackett , and Speake went below . Matt and Clackett were an hour at the valves before they were finally made dependable . All the while they were at work a deep silence reigned throughout the boat . Every one realized the necessity of keeping quiet so as not to arouse the Japs .  Matt , after swallowing a cup of coffee , came out on deck and began taking off his clothes .  Whats the game , matey ? asked Dick . Youre not going into the water and give the sharks a chance at you , are you ?  Im going ashore , said Matt .  I wouldnt do that , Matt , counseled Glennie . Why is it necessary ? If the valves are in shape , we can pull out of here and make our way north under water . The Japs will never be the wiser .  Im tired of bothering with these Sons of the Rising Sun , Matt answered . We never know what theyre going to do , or when theyre going to do it . I thought we had dropped them for good , down below English Reach , but they were clever enough to get away from Sandoval and play that trick in Lota . If possible , lets put them out of the running , now , for keeps .  How will you do it ? questioned Gaines .  Im not just sure of that , and wont be until I do a little reconnoitring ashore . Ive a scheme in mind , but I want to be positive it will work before we try it . Go down to the engine room , Gaines , and , Clackett , you take your usual place in the tank room . Heave up the anchor , Speake . Glennie , you get into the conning tower . If the current sets inshore and causes the Grampus to drift that way when the anchor is up , have the motor run just enough to hold the boat where she is . Dick , you hang on to the rifle . When you go down , Gaines , pass up the strongest cable we have , so that Carl can bend it on to the mooring ring at the stern . Understand ?  I guess we all understand what were to do , replied Glennie , but Ill be hanged if I know why were to do it .  Youll know--perhaps sooner than you imagine .  Matt , stripped to his trousers , stepped to the landward side of the boat .  Sharks always go in pairs , mate , cautioned Dick .  If you see one take after me , Dick , returned Matt , treat it the same as I did the one that took after you .  With hardly a splash Matt dropped into the water and swam toward the beach .     CHAPTER XII .  A WARY FOE .   Matt reached the beach without mishap . Beyond the white stretch of sand grew a chaparral of bushes and low trees , covering the slope which ended at a ridge forming the backbone of the point to the southward .  The young motorist took his way in this direction , halting at the edge of the brush for a moment to turn and give a reassuring wave to his comrades on the Grampus .  Carl was just securing the end of a rope to the iron ring at the stern of the boat , Glennie was half inside the conning tower , and Dick had the rifle across his knees . All three answered Matts parting salute , and he faced about and hurried into the chaparral .  Matts course carried him up the side of the ridge . Once at the crest he would be able to look down on the Japs and take note of their operations . He would thus be able to determine whether the bold scheme which he had at the back of his brain would be feasible or not .  The crest of the ridge was not more than fifty feet above sea level , and the king of the motor boys was not long in reaching it . There , screened by a thicket of bushes , he was able to look down on the other cove , and make a leisurely examination of the Pom and the Japs .  The Pom , as Dick had said , was lying within a short distance of the shore . She was an odd-looking craft , being of a much smaller diameter than the Grampus , and having a flat deck built over the rounded plates of her hull . The conning tower was only about half the height and diameter of that of the Grampus , and seemed to have a solid top without any hatch opening . The hatch was forward , on the flat deck , and the cover was pushed back .  From the submarine , Matts eyes wandered to the shelving beach .  The torpedo was there , rolled up beyond the reach of the lapping waves , and two of the Japs were busy about the conical end of the tube . Matt chuckled as he thought of how he had tampered with the firing pin . Before they could make the pin serviceable , the Japs would have to rig another of the little propellers; and , while their ingenuity was no doubt equal to the job , yet it would take time to finish it .  The two men who were at work were clad only in their trousers , and had clearly reached the shore as Matt had done , by swimming . They went about their work steadily and with an application which indicated that they had little attention for anything else .  From their manner , it seemed a fair inference that the rifle shot , or Dicks yell , from the other side of the point , had failed to reach them .  But where were the other two Japs ? Had they returned to the Pom ?  It might be that the two on the beach were in need of more tools and had sent the others out to the boat after them .  Matt , thinking of his plans , measured the distance from the end of the point to the Pom .  The Grampus can do it! he muttered , with an undernote of exultation throbbing in his voice . A quick dash , and then a hustle seaward--and the trick is done . But those other two Japs--I wish they would leave the boat and come ashore . They form the danger point in the carrying out of the scheme .  There was something else Matt noticed as he peered out from behind his thicket , and that was that two rifles lay on the sand within easy reach of the Jap mechanics .  Those guns are another danger point , he said to himself . The Pom , however , will be between the Grampus and the beach , and will act as a sort of barricade . Anyhow , nothing venture , nothing win .  For five minutes longer Matt waited , watching for the other two Japs to reappear through the Poms hatch . But they did not come , and he felt that he could wait no longer .  Arising from his crouching position , he turned to retrace his course down the hill . He had not taken a dozen steps , however , when , dodging around a clump of bushes , he came face to face with the two missing Japs!  From the actions of the two men , it was plain that they were as much surprised as was Motor Matt .  The cause of this unexpected meeting flashed through Matts brain like lightning .  The rifle shot had been heard , and these two Japs had been told to cross the ridge and investigate . Matt had gained the shore before the Japs had cleared the bushes and were able to see him . As they descended the slope , he was going up , and fortune had decreed that they give each other a wide berth . But fortune had taken another tack , for she was now bringing Matt and the Japs altogether too close to each other for comfort .  These Japs , like the two at work on the torpedo , were stripped of all unnecessary clothing; and , fortunately for the young motorist , they carried no weapons .  For an instant Matt and the two yellow men stared at each other; then the Japs gave vent to a yell , and prepared to keep Matt from continuing on down the hill .  Matt , remembering the two rifles he had seen on the beach , had no intention of waiting for the other two Japs to reach the scene . He saw the men before him preparing to lay him by the heels in the most approved ju-jutsu style , but that did not keep him back .  He leaped forward , apparently aiming to pass directly between the two men . They jumped to get in his way , whereupon he dodged to the right .  But , if he was quick , so were the Japs . No sooner had he changed his course than they also had faced the new direction .  As Matt went flying down the hill , one of them made a dive for him . The king of the motor boys struck out with his right fist--and he had a right about which Carl Pretzel was wont to sing praises .  The fist accomplished its work , so far as that one Jap was concerned . A sharp breath was jolted from the yellow man and the hands he had put out dropped limply , the while his whole body slumped backward .  But something happened to Matt , just what he had not the least idea . All he knew was that he was lifted high and sent crashing headfirst into a thicket of bushes .  The second Jap had put into practice one of the wrestling tricks he had learned in Nippon .  Matt , however , was not sorry he had been thrown in that unceremonious fashion , for , just as he dropped into the bushes , the sodden whang of a rifle spoke from the crest of the ridge and a bullet flew whining over the very spot where he had been running .  The other two Japs had lost little time in coming to the aid of their comrades .  Matt was up almost as soon as he was down . His superb physical training rendered him proof against any such fall as that he had just received .  Both Japs were reaching for him as he ducked clear of the bushes , but he slipped out from under their gripping fingers and flashed down the slope like a streak , screening his flight with every particle of tangled undergrowth that got in his way .  The rifles behind him continued to cough and splutter . The unarmed Japs , however , were between Matt and the marksmen , and the care the latter had to use sent their bullets wide .  The Japs were no match for Matt when it came to sprinting . Matt had learned the game from a half-breed friend , the best miler in Arizona , and he now showed the Japs how an American boy can run when he has his heart in it .  Before the yellow men had cleared the fringe of bushes at the edge of the beach , Motor Matt was in the water; and when the Japs emerged , Dick plowed up the ground at their feet with bullets from the Marlin , and drove them back .  Matt could not have swum faster if there had been a whole school of sharks after him , but before he got to the Grampus lead from the shore was pounding a merry tattoo against the submarines steel plates . Dick , exposing himself recklessly , was answering with the Marlin . Neither side was damaging the other , but the firing spurred Matt to superhuman exertions .  When the young motorist reached the boat , Carl ducked out from behind the conning tower and gave him a hand up the slope of the deck .  Nows the time , panted Matt , falling at full length across the curved plates . Start her--full speed .  Where are we to go ? demanded Glennie .  Around the point and take the Pom in tow , Matt answered . All four of the Japs are ashore , in this cove . Before they can cross the ridge and interfere with us , we ought to be able to pick up the other submarine and make off with her . Look alive , now! We cant turn the trick if you dont hustle .  The daring nature of Matts scheme dawned on the lads with something like a shock . And it appealed to them , too! It was just such a scheme as they might have expected Motor Matt to set going .  Hoop-a-la! jubilated Carl , as Glennie punched the motor-room jingler . Vat do you tink oof dot ? Modor Matt goes ashore mit himseluf und coaxes der Chaps to shace him mit rifles , schust to ged dem oudt oof der vay so ve can shteal pack der Pom . Vat a feller he iss!  Youre giving me altogether too much credit , Carl , expostulated Matt . I ran onto those Japs by accident , and would have gone a good ways to keep clear of them .  Vell , vats der odds aboudt der tifference ? Der modor poys iss on dop und----  A bullet from the shore slapped against the side of the conning tower and whistled off into space , passing so close to Carls head in its flight that he stopped his glorying and fell flat on the deck .  Theyll not stay long on the beach there when they see where were going , remarked Matt grimly .  Theyve stopped their firing now , old ship , cried Dick , and are rushing back into the bushes as fast as they can scramble .  It has probably dawned upon them that were planning to run off with the Pom , said Matt . Quick work , now , and well win the day , and cut these Sons of the Rising Sun out of our future calculations .  The propeller was churning the waters like mad , and Glennie was laying a safe course to round the point and bring the Grampus close to the Pom .     CHAPTER XIII .  PLUCK THAT WINS .   By the time that the Grampus got around the point and was plunging onward , with a bone in her teeth , straight for the Pom , Matt had recovered his breath and was ready to play his part in the rest of the work .  Make a circle around the stern of the Pom , Glennie , said Matt , peering shoreward to see if there were any signs of the Japs coming down the south side of the ridge . That will give Dick a chance to jump to the deck of the other craft .  Ill do it , Matt , replied Glennie .  Give me the rifle , Dick , went on Matt , and you lay hold of the end of the rope Carl has secured to the ring . As soon as you get on the other boat , make the rope fast .  Ay , ay , matey! cried Dick , elation ringing in his voice and his eyes glimmering with excitement . Well make a go of this , now that you have planned the scheme and done the heft of the work in getting it started .  There may still be a whole lot of trouble and hard work between us and success . Lets not be too confident . Ah , and Matt pointed toward the side of the ridge , there come the Japs . Theyre running even faster than they did when they were after me . Were going to have a tight squeak of it , Glennie , to double the stern of the Pom , get Dick aboard and pull away with our tow before the Japs get into the water .  Its their guns Im thinking of , said Glennie . If they happen to pick me out of the conning tower , or to knock Dick off the deck of the Pom , the fat would all be in the fire .  Theyll not do either of those things , matey , averred Dick confidently . Its our innings , now , and were bound to score .  The Grampus raced on , and down the slope rushed the Japs in a frantic endeavor to reach the water and gain the Pom before the venturesome motor boys could carry out their plans .  No shots were fired by the Japs . This seemed strange , since a well-placed bullet would have meant so much to them .  Whats the reason theyre not tuning up , matey ? asked Dick .  Dey hafent got der time for dot , chuckled Carl . Deyre in too mooch oof of a hurry , py shinks .  They could put a couple of bullets where they would play hob with us , went on Dick , and they must know it .  They do know it , said Matt . There are four of the Japs , and only two guns . I rather surmise that they have used up all the ammunition in the magazines of the rifles , and that their reserve supply is on the Pom .  Just at that moment Glennie swerved the Grampus to pass between the stern of the Pom and the shore .  Ready , Dick! warned Matt .  Right-o , answered Dick , seizing one end of the cable and balancing himself on the port side of the Grampus . Swing her as close as you can , Glennie , he added to the ensign .  Supporting himself by clinging to a wire guy with one hand , Dick waited . Glennie signaled the engine room for slower speed , and the Grampus rounded neatly and pushed her nose past the tower of the other boat .  There you are , Dick! cried Matt .  The next instant Dick had leaped across the intervening stretch of water and had landed on the flat deck of the Pom .  Before his feet had struck the deck , however , Matt saw a Japs head and shoulders push upward through the Poms hatch . If there had been time to feel anything so useless as surprise , Matt would certainly have been taken all aback .  Captain Pons had said that only five Japs had comprised the crew which had palmed themselves off as Chilians . One of these five had been left in Lota , a prisoner . According to Matts reckoning , that left only four of the yellow men in charge of the Pom . Where , then , did this extra Jap come in ?  Matt did not pause to let this drift through his mind . Making a short run across the Grampus , he flung himself after Dick , reaching the flat deck of the other submarine and only saving himself a fall over the opposite side of the craft by dropping to his knees .  Hardly had he landed when a pair of heavy feet clanged down behind him and a form collided roughly with his back . Once more Matt came within a hairs breadth of dropping off the port side of the Pom .  Py shinks , puffed a choppy voice , you dond vas going to leaf me pehindt! Dere iss more Chaps on dis poat as we knowed aboudt , und----  Carls sentence was never finished . The Jap Matt had seen in the open hatch had gained the deck and had rushed at Carl like a whirlwind . Another showed himself , following close upon the heels of the first .  Make the rope fast , Dick! roared Matt . Carl and I will look after these fellows .  Dick went down on his knees and began securing the rope . It was necessary to make it fast before the slack was all taken up , otherwise the tow line would have been jerked out of Dicks hands and the work would have had to be done all over again .  Matt caught the second Jap about the waist as he crawled through the hatch . There was a brief struggle , and it ended by Matt heaving the Jap over the side and into the water . The other Jap had performed a like service for Carl , and the Dutch boy , blowing like a porpoise , was floating around in the bay , trying to get hold of something and pull himself back on the deck .  The Jap started at once for Matt . Before he reached him , Dick , who had made fast the line , rushed him from the rear and literally bore him off the boat . He dropped into the water alongside his comrade .  Help Carl aboard , Dick! called Matt .  Dick bent over and gave Carl a hand . Just at that moment the boat leaped forward under the sudden pull of the Grampus .  But here , just as victory was all but ranged on the side of the motor boys , the unexpected happened .  Perhaps Glennie was to blame . It would have been better if he had slowed the Grampus down almost to a stop and then picked up the strain on the tow line with a steady pull .  It was useless , however , to find fault with anybody . The thing happened , and that was all there was to it .  The tow line snapped . One end of it jerked back and caught Matt a tremendous blow on the temple , and he dropped as though from the impact of a heavy fist .  A howl of consternation broke from Carl .  Ids all oop mit us! he shouted . Der rope iss pusted in der mittle , Matt is down , und der Chaps iss all aroundt us!  Carls quick eyes had sized up the situation correctly . The four Japs who had crossed the ridge from the other cove had reached the water and were swimming to the Pom . The two who had been forced overboard by Matt and his chums were paddling about and making frantic efforts to regain the deck .  Dick had not much time to think of what they should do . With Matt down , could he and Carl successfully beat off the six yellow men ?  Dick flung a despairing glance after the Grampus . Glennie , wild with anxiety over the outcome of what seemed a certain fiasco , was ringing all kinds of signals in the motor room , and , for once in his life , seemed completely rattled and at a loss as to what move he should make .  At that moment an idea darted into Dicks brain .  Keep away , Glennie! Dick yelled , waving his hands . Sheer off to a good distance , and wait! Carl , and he whirled on the Dutch boy with fierce determination , well take Matt below . We can close ourselves inside the steel shell and the Japs wont be able to get at us .  Meppy deres more Chaps in der poat! demurred Carl .  No! thundered Dick . Do you suppose theyd stay below while this scrimmage was going on over their heads ? Down the hatch with you , and take Matt as I lower him!  Carl saw that there was nothing else for it , and made haste to carry out his orders . The floor was less than five feet under the deck , and Carl was able to stand erect and take Matt in his arms as Dick let him down . The Japs were gaining the deck from all sides as Dick followed , and the hatch cover was banged shut and made fast just in the nick of time .  Ach , du lieber! muttered Carl , listening to the patter of bare feet on the plates overhead . Vat a fix iss dis . Der Chaps haf got us , und dey aind got us; und ve haf got dem in der same vay . Ve cant ged oudt , und dey cant ged in . Vats der answer ?  A little light , first , said Dick coolly . Dont let the Japs worry you--theres a stout steel armor between us and them . Its as black as a pocket in here , now that the hatch is closed . Have you got a match ?  It took Carl several moments to dig a match out of his blouse . He had one , just one , and it was a wonder he had even that . No one had any use for matches aboard the Grampus .  Carl drew the match along the steel floor . As the flickering gleam grew stronger , he and Dick took in the dimensions of that part of their prison .  The floor apparently divided the interior of the steel hull in half , the rounded plates of the hull meeting it on both sides . A bulkhead cut off the view aft .  You rub Matts forehead and hands and see if you cant fetch him to , said Dick . Im going aft to see whats on the other side of that bulkhead .  Der match iss gone! muttered Carl , dropping the charred stick .  Ive located the bulkhead door , so it doesnt much matter , answered Dick .  The opening of the door brought in a little daylight . The door led out under the conning tower , and the light came through the tower lunettes .  Dick , straightening up , shoved his head and shoulders into the tower . On all sides Jap eyes were glaring in at him .  Ugh! he muttered , and dropped down again .     CHAPTER XIV .  A LITTLE WORK ON THE INSIDE .   When Matt drifted back to consciousness , his head lay on Carls knee . Carl and Dick had dragged him out under the conning tower , where the light was better .  Where are we ? were Matts first words .  In the Pom , matey , was Dicks grim response .  Ve cant ged oudt , eider , Matt , croaked Carl gloomily , und der Chaps cant ged in . Vich vould you radder be , der Chaps or us ?  Matt sat up , rubbing his head .  I remember now , he murmured . The tow line broke , and the Pom end of it sprang back and hit me on the forehead . You brought me below ?  I couldnt think of anything else to do , matey , said Dick . We were surrounded by six Japs , and I thought it better to take our chances inside . We got below and closed the hatch just in time . Listen! You can hear the Japs walking around on deck . If you get up in the tower you can see them looking in at the lunettes! But its not pleasant . The straightened eyes of those swabs are pretty savage . I wouldnt give tuppence for our chances if they could get at us . And they may find out a way to come in here . If you can think of anything to do that will help us out of this hole , Matt , please be in a hurry about it .  Yah , put in Carl , dond vaste any time .  Wheres the Grampus ? asked Matt .  His head bothered him , but there was no time to think of physical troubles of that sort .  I told Glennie to keep her away . There wasnt anything he could do by running close , anyhow . The Japs would have boarded the Grampus , if he had come too close , and there would be only four on our boat to stand off the six Japs .  Oh , well , remarked Matt , looking around , this might be worse .  How ? moaned Carl . I dond see dot .  Matts interest in the Pom , now that he was able to give the boat a personal examination , bade fair to eclipse his concern for the dangers by which he was surrounded . Here was a brand-new piece of mechanism , a boat crammed with French machinery that would well repay a close study .  A rigid box under the conning tower , enabled a man to lift the upper half of his body into the cupola and get his eyes opposite the lunettes . As the man stood there , his right hand fell naturally on a steering wheel and his left on push buttons which must communicate with the engine room .  This is a whole lot different from the interior of the Grampus , muttered Matt .  Id is so shmall as a rat drap , shuddered Carl . I feel like I vas shut oop in a cage .  Matt , pushing backward from the turret , fell off a ledge into a sort of well . As he sat up and groped about with his hands , he touched a switch . Pulling the switch , an incandescent lamp flared out overhead .  Thats better , said he . Now we can look around without so much trouble .  Here , aft from the conning tower , machinery was packed away closely .  Up against the roof , on the port side , was a little engine , operated by compressed air , by which the submarine was steered . Matt discovered that by observing the wires that ran to the engine from the steering wheel .  On the starboard side , likewise against the roof , was another engine , with disks at each end as large as dinner plates .  Hm , mused Matt , trying to rub the ache out of his head so his brain would be clearer , those disks are diaphragms , and must be connected , in some way , with the water pressure . I have it! and a triumphant look crossed his face , this is the diving engine , and that wheel--he touched the wheel as he spoke--controls it .  At one side was a cubic steel box .  Air compressor , said Matt , touching the box .  On the floor , just where Matt had dropped into the well , were two levers . Matt lifted one of them . Instantly there came a gurgle and splash of water , directly under Carl and Dick .  Avast , matey! cried Dick . I wouldnt fool with those things until you know more about them .  Muffled cries came from the Japs outside .  They hear whats going on , laughed Matt , and they dont like it . Were filling the submerging tanks , Dick , he explained .  Then why dont we sink ?  It takes the engine to help us sink--the diving engine and the motor .  Farther back beyond the well was the engine room .  Heres where Im at home , said Matt , creeping into the engine room and turning on another incandescent light .  In one side were switchboards for the dynamotors , and near them were spiral resistance coils curving along the roof . Over on the other side was a trolley controller , which Matt knew must be used for speeding the vessel under water .  Give the wheel of that diving engine a turn to the right , Dick , called Matt .  Dick obeyed the order . Matt turned the switch of the controller and then instantly there was a low , electrical hum and the Pom started toward the bottom .  Get on the box under the conning tower , Dick , said Matt , and do the steering .  Howll I steer ? Theres no periscope .  Steer by compass--theres one right in front of you as you stand in the tower .  But whatll I do for light ? Were under water and no daylight comes in at the lunettes .  Matt touched a switch , and electric light flooded the tower .  I dont like this tinkering , Im a Fiji if I do , muttered Dick , as he crawled up into the tower .  Weve got rid of the Japs by the tinkering , Dick , said Matt . Theyre swimming ashore by now .  What Im afraid of is , went on Dick , youll get us on the bottom and not be able to take us to the surface again .  Dont let that worry you . If we want to go to the surface , all we have to do is to twist the diving rudders and empty the tanks .  Whats the course , matey ? asked Dick .  West by north until we clear the point , then north .  How am I to know when we clear the point ?  Why , well go to the surface and take a look . Glennie will probably be glad to have a sight of us before long .  Ill bet hes worrying his head off! The quicker we can go up , Matt , the better .  All right . Carl!  On der chump! answered the Dutch boy .  Give the wheel of the diving engine a turn to the left--to the left , mind .  Dere she goes .  Instantly there was a perceptible movement upward .  Now , went on Matt , lift that other lever on the floor near you--the one I didnt lift , if you can remember .  Carl lifted the lever , and , by chance , the right one . A hiss of compressed air was heard , followed by a splash of water being forced from the ballast tanks . The Pom jumped for the surface like a streak .  Daylight at the lunettes! shouted Dick , overjoyed to make sure that Matt really knew what he was about . All youve got to do to know all about a piece of machinery , Matt , he added , is just to look at it .  And use my head , laughed Matt .  Py shinks , boomed Carl , you can do more mit a cracked head dan any odder feller can do mit vone dots all ridght . Yah , so helup me . You know more aboudt machinery in a year as anypody else does in a minid .  See anything of the Japs , Dick ? inquired Matt , stopping the electric motor .  Not a sign! exulted Dick . But theres the old Grampus , with Speake on deck and Glennie half out of the tower . Their eyes are this way , and youd think , from their faces , theyre looking at a ghost .  Dey cant oondershtand how ve got oudt oof dot schrape , said Carl . Ve hat some pooty pad brospects , for a vile , you bed you .  Holy smoke! exclaimed Dick , almost falling off the box he was standing on .  Whats the matter ?  Why , theres our old friend , the cruiser Salvadore , with--with---- Pon my soul , Matt , Im a Fiji if that Captain Pons isnt on the bridge with Captain Sandoval!  This was amazing news .  The war ship must have just got here , then , said Matt .  But how did she know where we were ?  Probably she spoke the Sovereign , Matt answered . That would have given Sandoval a pretty good clue .  Oh , strike me lucky! The Salvadore is turning broadside on , and some of her crew are manning the small guns--the rapid-fire guns . Theyre going to blow us out of water , Matt!  Hardly that , Dick , said Matt easily . Sandoval isnt going to destroy this submarine . Pons wouldnt let him , even if he had such a notion . If anything happened to the boat , Pons wouldnt be able to deliver her to the Chilian government .  Theyre mighty warlike , anyway , went on Dick . And theres Glennie , on the Grampus , trying his best to attract the attention of Sandoval .  Sandoval and Pons think the Pom is full of Japs , laughed Matt . Wed better go up and clear the fog out of their brains . It will be a pleasure to meet Captain Sandoval again . Hes a good friend of ours , you know .  Meppy dot vas a lucky ting , vouchsafed Carl , seeing as how Pons iss madt pecause ve vouldnt go afder der Pom mit der Grampus .  Thats just what we did , though , although we didnt intend making any such move . We shall now have the pleasure of turning the Pom over to Captain Pons .  Making their way through the bulkhead door , Matt , Dick , and Carl gained the hatch , threw it open , and crawled out on the submarines deck .     CHAPTER XV .  A STAR PERFORMANCE .   The Pom was lying between the Grampus and the Salvadore . When Matt , Dick , and Carl showed themselves there were loud cheers from Glennie and Speake . Pons , on the bridge of the war ship , could be seen jumping up and down like a pea on a hot griddle , waving his hands and yelling . The war ship was too far away for the boys to hear what Pons said .  Id about given you fellows up! exclaimed Glennie . When that confounded tow line parted , my hopes parted with it . We saw you sink and throw the Japs into the water , and we were sure youd gone down to stay .  The Japs got ashore , did they ? asked Matt .  Every last one of them .  Well , Glennie , come along here and take us off . I want to go to the war ship and make a report to Captain Sandoval .  Glennie brought the Grampus close to the French boat , and the three boys transferred themselves to their own craft .  I vouldnt trade vone oof der Grampuses for a tozen of der Poms , asserted Carl , as they were borne away in the direction of the Salvadore .  I dont know how seven Japs ever stowed themselves away inside the Pom , muttered Dick . They must have been packed in there like sardines .  They managed to do a pretty fair amount of work , too , said Matt . Not the least of it was lassoing me and pulling me into the water .  As the Grampus approached the war ship , Captain Sandoval leaned from the bridge with his megaphone .  Motor Matt , king of the motor boys! he shouted . Ah , ha , amigo , you are as full of surprises as the egg is of meat .  Captain Pons failed to join Captain Sandoval in his amiable sentiment . Pons shook his fist .  R-r-rascal! he shouted . He is mos contemptible!  Throw over your sea ladder , captain , called Matt; I want to come aboard and talk with you .  Gracias! cried Sandoval . I am delighted , amigo .  A few minutes later Matt was in the captains cabin . He had been there once before , but not under circumstances that were very pleasant . On the previous occasion , Captain Sandoval had been hostile and full of unjust suspicions . Now he was more than friendly , and it was Captain Pons who was hostile .  You heard how those rascally Japs gave me the slip , amigo ? asked Sandoval . Ah , ah , what a wretched piece of business! It was in a fog , and one could not see his hand in front of his face . Thus they escaped . Ay de mi , it was a blow! I came north looking for the rascals , and I reached Lota last night and found Pons . He told me of the troubles he has been having with the Japs , and since it was my duty to aid him in recovering the Pom , why , I took him aboard and we started north . The British vessel Sovereign gave us a tip , and we followed it to this bay . First , we saw the Grampus; then , all so suddenly , up out of the ocean came the Pom! I trained my guns on her to fire in case the Japs proved unreasonable . Presently , behold , the hatch of the Pom opens and you appear . Wonderful! I can hardly believe my eyes because of the so great surprise!  Ah , my captain , broke in Pons , zis Matt is ze r-ruf-fian , ze villain . He say he no haf ze time to bozzer wiz my little boat , zat he not go hunt for her; now , by gar , we see heem on her deck . He play ze trick wiz me . He do wat he say he not do . He try steal ze boat , oui , zat is wat he do . I demand of heem ze satisfaction!  The captains eyes became very fierce and he threw back his shoulders and slapped his chest .  Ah , my captain , said Sandoval , dont make a mistake . I know Motor Matt , and he is a gentleman . I have given him my hand , my captain , and Captain Sandoval never gives his hand to a scoundrel .  Captain Pons arose with much dignity and bowed to Captain Sandoval .  Merci , monsieur! he murmured . Nevair vill I say ze derogatory word to youar honor , but ze actions of zis Motor Matt , wat you call , is mos contemptible . Let heem spik , let heem explain if he can .  Amigo , said Captain Sandoval , you will explain , for my sake , to my honorable friend , Captain Pons ?  Thats what I came here to do , answered Matt . I and my friends have saved the Pom for Captain Pons , and this is the reward he gives us .  Captain Pons got up and bowed again to Captain Sandoval . Not to be outdone in courtesy , Captain Sandoval arose and bowed to Captain Pons .  If I do heem ze wrong , said Captain Pons gravely , zen I make ze amende . Until he explains , I have ze right to call him mos contemptible .  You have the right , agreed Captain Sandoval .  Then they bowed again and sat down .  All this was highly edifying to Matt , but it did not get him very far along with his explanation .  When he got started , however , he held the floor in spite of disturbing symptoms on the part of Pons to get up and bow . He carried the explanation through to its conclusion , and not failing to put due stress on the dangers he and his friends had undergone in their attempt to get the better of the Sons of the Rising Sun .  The two captains were deeply impressed . For some moments after Matt had finished they sat speechless in their chairs; then , as one man they arose . Together they bowed to Matt .  Ay de mi , breathed Captain Sandoval , did you ever hear of anything so wonderful ?  Mos r-r-remarkable! exclaimed Captain Pons .  Then they bent to each other . After that Captain Sandoval sat down , but Captain Pons stepped over to Matt and embraced him; then , before Matt could defend himself , Captain Pons kissed him on the cheek .  Mon ami! said he; my friend , I mak ze apologee . I ask zat you forgeeve ze talk about you as ze mos contemptible . It is I , me , zat is mos contemptible----  No , no , my captain , protested Captain Sandoval , putting up his hand , you shall not so greatly injure yourself .  I r-r-repeat , thundered Captain Pons , thumping his chest fiercely , I made ze mistake , and I , myself , am mos contemptible .  Captain Sandoval sighed and looked depressed .  Zis brav young man , proceeded Captain Pons , save ze Pom for me . I sank heem , as one gentleman sank anozzer . Zere , ze debt is cancel . All zat remain is for me to hol him in mos tender memory .  The six Japanese are on the island , Captain Sandoval , said Matt , who was beginning to get a little bit tired of Pons and his mushy nonsense . Will you send a party ashore to capture them ?  At once , was the answer .  And , by the way , Captain Pons , went on Matt , didnt you say there were only five Japs in the crew that stole the Pom .  Fife , oui . I count zem and I know .  Well , that one we captured under the wharf , at Lota , comes out of the five , and would leave four .  Oui , wan from fife is four .  Then , captain , how do you account for the fact that there were six on the Pom when she reached this bay ?  Do you say I spik untruths ? flared the captain , displaying a tendency to renew his quarrel with Matt .  Not at all , not for the world , answered Matt , with an inward laugh , but I am puzzled . One from five , in this case , seems to have left six .  I know nozzing , sare , said Captain Pons . If zere was seex wen zere should only haf been fife , zat is zeir business .  Then well let it stand that way , said Matt .  I am mos agreeable , returned Captain Pons . Presently , my captain , he went on , to Sandoval , I go aboard ze Pom wiz ze crew you gif me , an we take ze boat to Valparaiso . Is it not so ?  Yes , my captain , replied Sandoval . I will lend you the crew and will convoy you to Valparaiso .  You are mos kind .  This was enough for Matt . He excused himself , shook hands with Sandoval , and hurried away .  As soon as he was safely in the periscope room of the Grampus , he threw himself down on the locker and laughed until he was sore .  Get me the rest of my clothes , somebody , said he , and then start the Grampus northward again .  Wheres our next port of call , old ship ? queried Dick , while Matt was getting into the garments he had taken off just before swimming ashore in the cove .  Callao , answered Matt . Then Panama , Acapulco , San Diego--and Frisco .  Dot lisdens like home! rumbled Carl .  In two weeks , cried Glennie , well be at Mare Island , and the cruise will be finished . Its all plain sailing from this on . The Sons of the Rising Sun will have all they can do to take care of themselves , let alone try to make any more trouble for us .  Were done with them , and there are no ifs or ands about it this time , said Matt . Ill admit , when I learned they had made off with that French submarine , that I thought they were equipped to accomplish something against us; but we cleared that difficulty in one-two order when we got started .  It might have been a lot worse , mates , observed Dick , and there were several times when I thought we were done , done as brown as a kippered herring; but we pulled through--mainly because Matt had his shoulder to the wheel and gave us the right sort of a boost over the hard places .  As much credit should fall to the rest of you as to me , spoke up Matt . Take the wheel , Glennie . Full speed ahead , Gaines , he added , through the motor-room tube .  The cylinders never hummed a cheerier tune than they did when they started the Grampus once more on her journey northward , and no boat , surface or submarine , ever carried a happier crew .     CHAPTER XVI .  CONCLUSION .   As day followed day and week followed week , bringing no sign of any further trouble with the Sons of the Rising Sun , Motor Matt and his friends realized that , beyond all doubt , they had worsted their wily foes , and perhaps had taught them a lesson which they could ponder wisely .  At Panama , which was almost the same as United States soil , the boys took shore leave , turn and turn about . From this place Matt sent a cablegram to Captain Nemo , Jr . , at Belize .    On the last leg of our journey . All well and Grampus as fit as a   fiddle . Telegraph me at Acapulco .  Too bad that old canal wasnt finished , observed Dick , as the Grampus left Panama , at the time we left Belize . We could have come through it , if it had been , and saved a months time and all that mix-up with the Japs .  That wasnt the point , Dick , spoke up Glennie . This trip has been in the nature of a try-out for the Grampus . The government wanted to see what she could do--and I guess the government will know when my log is read at headquarters .  Youre giving us a good report , Glennie ? laughed Dick .  As good as I can make it .  Then that means a sale of the boat , without a doubt .  I understood that my report was to be final . Ive had the cruise of my life with you motor boys , and I almost hate to reach San Francisco , because well have to separate there .  Youre an A One comrade , Glennie , said Matt heartily , and you need never look for a pal while this outfit of motor boys is around .  My sentiments to a t , y , ty , averred Dick .  Und mine , too , py shinks! cried Carl .  Glennie was deeply touched . At the beginning of the cruise there had been some hard feelings between him and Dick and Carl , but as they had come to know each other better the unpleasantness had worn away .  All four of the lads were now loyal friends , having undergone perils and dangers shoulder to shoulder , and so each had tried the others and had not found them wanting .  At Acapulco Matt was confidently expecting to receive a message from Captain Nemo , Jr . In this , however , he was disappointed . There was no message for him . Matt could not understand the reason and was prone to think dire things .  Captain Nemo , Jr . , would surely have answered that message I sent him from Panama , said Matt , providing he had received it .  Sure he would , agreed Glennie; and the fact that you did not get an answer is proof that the captain did not receive your message .  Aber vy ditnt he receif id ? asked Carl .  Thats the point that alarms me , friends , went on Matt gloomily . You know we left the captain sick at Belize; too ill , in fact , to come with us on the Grampus . We havent heard a word from him since the cruise began , and it may be that his sickness terminated fatally .  This thought cast a depression over the motor boys . Captain Nemo , Jr . , was a good friend of theirs , and all of them liked him . The Grampus was the triumph of the captains career , and if he was to be stricken down just as the boat , in charge of the motor boys , was to pass successfully through the Golden Gate , the elation Matt and his friends would otherwise feel must give way to dejection and sorrow .  The victory of this successful cruise was entirely theirs , but the loss of Captain Nemo , Jr . , would rob the victory of all pleasure for them .  But the gloom that accompanied the submarine from Acapulco northward was lost in rejoicing at San Diego; for no sooner had the Grampus anchored in the bay off the latter place than no less a person than Captain Nemo , Jr . , himself , rowed out and came aboard .  The captain was well and hearty , and his delight in welcoming the boys was boundless .  He looked over the boat and complimented all hands on her efficiency after such a long cruise--the longest and hardest any submarine had ever made; and in the periscope room , until long into the night , the captain sat wide-eyed and absorbed , listening to the adventures of those whom he had commissioned to take the Grampus from Belize to Mare Island .  When all had had their say , and the recital was done , there followed a period of silence . The captain was the first to speak .  A hundred thousand dollars , my lads , is a great deal of money; but if I had been able to look ahead and learn what dangers were to beset you on your long journey , I would not have allowed you to start for a million . I had some inkling of this Japanese business , for I was offered two hundred thousand for the Grampus by the Japanese government . I chose to deal with the navy department of my own country , even at a direct pecuniary loss to myself . My refusal to sell to the Japs brought a threatening letter from the Sons of the Rising Sun , but I treated it with contempt . I should have taken you into my confidence regarding this Japanese matter before you left Belize , but I thought it of no moment and hesitated to alarm you by even mentioning it .  Its all but over now , captain , laughed Matt lightly , and I think we are all of us better for the experience . I know I wouldnt sell the benefit that has accrued to me from this cruise for a lot of money .  Nor I , said Dick .  Me , neider , chirped Carl .  Let me go on record , too , put in Glennie .  Im glad you all feel in that way about it , said the captain .  By the way , asked Matt , why didnt you answer the cablegram I sent you from Panama , captain ?  Principally because I never received it , was the smiling response . Where did you address the message , Matt ?  To you , at Belize .  Why , I left Belize a week after you did! It was my intention all along to leave Central America , work up into the States , and then meet you here and take the last lap of the cruise with you .  It was a mighty big relief to see you come aboard at this port , said Matt . I hadnt the least idea what was the matter .  You had a guess that I had taken the One-way Trail , hadnt you , Matt ? jested the captain .  I didnt know but that might have happened .  In that event , said the captain , I had already made a will whereby you boys were to receive the whole amount to be paid by the government . So , you see , my being alive has cost you a pretty pile .  The money doesnt count , captain , declared Matt stoutly .  No ? Well , money usually counts in this world , Matt--in fact , it cuts a pretty wide swath in every direction .  It is secondary , captain , to the idea of making good . When we left Belize I vowed that wed make good and prove that your confidence in us wasnt misplaced . Weve all had that in mind before anything and everything else .  Its a good trait in you , replied the captain , and in any young man , to love a piece of work for itself , and , money apart , centre every hope on making a success of it . Thats the spirit that brings its reward , not only in money , but in self-approval , which is something money cant buy . Every one who went around South America on the Grampus will find , I think , that I know how to be grateful; this , while of secondary importance to the consciousness of duty well performed , will be a substantial acknowledgment of the debt I hold myself under to all of you .  In San Francisco the Grampus will be sold . The motor boys will go one way , Captain Nemo , Jr . , another way , and Speake , Gaines , and Clackett still another . But I hope that this will not be the last of our associations , but that we shall sometime come together again and renew our friendships , which have been so firmly woven together by this cruise of the Grampus , and the persistent and successful effort of the king of the motor boys to make good .  With the hearty echoes this sentiment received still lingering in our ears , the hour seems propitious for taking leave of Matt and the motor boys , while they are at the threshold of another of their many victories .

STREET & SMITH , Publishers ,   79-89 Seventh Avenue , New York City .     THE SPIDER WATER .   II .  On the 30th there was trouble beyond Wild Hat , and all our extra men , put out there under Healey , were fighting to Hold the Rat Valley levels where they hug the river on the west slope . It wasnt really Healeys track . Bucks sent him over there just as the emperor sent Ney , wherever he needed his right arm . Sunday , while Healey was at Wild Hat , rain began falling . Sunday it rained; Monday all through the mountains it rained; Tuesday it was raining from Omaha to Eagle Pass , with the thermometer climbing for breath and the barometer flat as an adder--and the Spider woke . Woke with the April water and the June water and the storm water all at once .  Trackwalkers Tuesday night flagged Number One , and reported the Spider wild , with heavy sheet ice running . A wire from Bucks brought Healey out of the west and into the east , and brought him to reckon for the last time with his ancient enemy .  He was against it Wednesday with dynamite . All the day , all the night , all the next day the sullen roar of the giant powder shook the forming jam above the bridge , and after two days Healey wired , Ice out , and set back without a minutes sleep for home . Saturday night he slept and Sunday all day and Sunday night . Monday about noon Bucks sent up to ask , but Healey still slept . They asked back by the lad whether they should wake him . Bucks sent word , No .  It was late Tuesday morning when the tall roadmaster came down , and he was fresh as sunshine . All day he sat with Bucks and the dispatchers watching the line . The Spider raced mad , and the watchers sent in panic messages , but Healey put them in his pipe . That bridge will go when the mountains go , was all he said .  Nine oclock that night every star was blinking when Healey looked in for the trackwalkers reports and the railroad weather bulletins . Bucks , Callahan , and Peeto sat about Martin Duffy , the dispatcher , who in his shirt sleeves threw the stuff off the sounder as it trickled in dot and dash , dot and dash over the wires .  The west wire was good; east everything below Peace River was down . We had to get the eastern reports around by Omaha and the south--a good thousand miles of a loop--but bad news travels even around a Robin Hood loop .  And first came Wild Hat from the west with a stationary river and the Loup Creek falling--clear--good night . And Ed Peeto struck the table heavily and swore it was well in the west . Then from the east came Prairie Portage , all the way round , with a northwest rain , a rising river , and anchor ice running , pounding the piers bad--track in fair shape , and--and----  The wire went wrong . As Duffy knit his eyes and tugged and cussed a little , the wind outside took up the message and whirled a bucket of rain against the windows . But the wires wouldnt right , and stuff that no man could get tumbled in like a dictionary upside down . And Bucks and Callahan and Healey and Peeto smoked , silent , and heard the deepening drum of the rain on the roof .  Then Duffy wrestled mightily yet once more .  Keep still , he exclaimed , leaning heavily on the key . Heres something--from the Spider .  He snatched a pen and ran it across a clip; Bucks leaning over read aloud from his shoulder:                                                                  Omaha .    J . F . BUCKS:    Trainmen from No . 75 stalled west of Rapid City--track afloat in   Simpsons Cut--report Spider bridge out--send----  And the current broke .  Callahans hand closed rigidly over the hot bowl of his pipe; Peeto sat speechless; Bucks read again at the broken message , but Healey sprang like a man wounded and snatched the clip from his hand .  He stared at the running words till they burned his eyes , and then , with an oath , frightful as the thunder that shook the mountains , he dashed the clip to the floor . His eyes snapped greenish , and he cursed Omaha , cursed its messages , and everything that came out of it . Slow at first , then fast and faster , until all the sting that poisoned his heart in his unjust discharge poured from his lips . It flooded the room like a spilling stream , and none put a word against it , for they knew he stood a wronged man . Out it came--all the rage , all the heart-burning , all the bitterness--and he dropped into a chair and covered his face with his hands . Only the sounder clicking iron jargon and the thunder shaking the wickiup like a reed filled the ears of the men about him . They watched him slowly knot his fingers and loosen them , and saw his face rise dry and hard and old out of his hands .  Get up an engine!  Not--youre not going down there to-night ? stammered Bucks .  Yes . Now . Right off . Peeto , get out your men!  The foreman jumped for the door . Little Duffy , snatching the train sheet , began clearing track for a bridge special . In twenty minutes twenty men were running as many ways through the storm , and a live engine boomed under the wickiup window .  I want you to be careful , Phil , Bucks spoke anxiously as he looked with Healey out into the storm . Its a bad night . Healey made no answer .  The lightning shot the yards in a blaze and a crash split the gorge . A wicked night , muttered Bucks .  Evans , conductor of the special , ran in .  Heres your orders , said Duffy . Youve got forty miles an hour .  Dont stretch it , warned Bucks . Good-by , Phil , he added to Healey , Ill see you in the morning .  In the morning , echoed Healey . Good-by .  The switch engine had puffed up with a caboose; ahead of it Peeto had coupled in the pile driver . At the last minute Callahan concluded to go , and with the bridge gang tumbling into the caboose , the assistant superintendent , Ed Peeto , and Healey climbed into the engine , and they pulled out , five in the cab , for the Spider Water .  Healey , moody at first , began joking and laughing the minute they got away . He sat behind Denis Mullenix , the engineer , and poked his ribs and taunted him with his heavy heels . At last he covered Denis big hands on the throttle with his own bigger fingers , good-naturedly coaxed them loose , and pushing him away got the reins and the whip into his own keeping . He drew the bar out a notch and settled himself for the run across the flat country .  As they sped from the shelter of the hills , the storm shook them with a freshening fury , and drove the flanges into the south rail with a grinding screech . The rain fell in a sheet , and the right-of-way ran a river . The wind , whipping the water off the ballast , dashed it like hail against the cab glass; the segment of desert caught in the yellow of the headlight rippled and danced and swam in the storm water , and Healey pulled again at the straining throttle and latched it wider .  Notch after notch he drew; heedless of lurch and jump; heedless of bed or curve; heedless of track or storm; and with every spur at her cylinders the engine shook like a frantic horse . Men and monster alike lost thought of caution and drunk a frenzy in the whirl that Healey opened across the swimming plain .  The Peace River hills loomed suddenly in front like moving pictures; before they could think it the desert was behind .  Phil , man , you must steady up! yelled Callahan , getting his mouth to Healeys ear . The roadmaster nodded and checked a notch , but the fire was in his blood , and he slewed into the hills with a speed unslackened . The wind blew them , and the track pulled them , and a frenzied man sat at the throttle .  Just where the line crosses the Peace River the track bends sharply through the Needles to take the bridge . The curve is a ten degree . As they struck it , the headlight shot far out upon the river--and they in the cab knew they sat dead men . Instead of lighting the box of the truss , the lamp lit a black and snaky flood with yellow foam sweeping over the abutment , for the Peace had licked up Agnews thirty-foot piles--and his bridge was not .  There were two things to do; Healey knew them both , and both meant death to the cab , but the caboose sheltered twenty of Healeys faithful men . He instantly threw the air , and with a scream from the tires , the special , shaking in the brake shoes , swung the curve . Again the roadmaster checked heavily , and the pile driver , taking the elevation like a hurdle , bolted into the Needles , dragging the caboose after it . But engine and tender and five in the cab plunged head on into the river .  Not a man in the caboose was killed . They scrambled out of the splinters and on their feet , men and ready to do . One voice came through the storm from the river , and they answered its calling . It was Callahan , but Durden , Mullenix , Peeto , and Healey never called again .  At daybreak , wreckers of the West End , swarming from mountain and plain , were heading for the Peace , and the McCloud gang--up--crossed the Spider on Healeys bridge--on the bridge the coward trainmen had reported out , quaking as they did in the storm at the Spider foaming over its approaches . But Healeys bridge stood--stands to-day .  Yet three days the Spider raged , and knew then its master , while he , three whole days , sat at the bottom of the Peace , clutching the engine levers , in the ruins of Agnews mistake .  And when the divers got them up , Callahan and Bucks tore big Peetos arms from his masters body and shut his staring eye and laid him at his masters side . And only the Spider , ravening at Healeys caissons , raged . But Healey slept .   THE END .     GOOD WORDS FOR THE GATOR .   Twenty years ago a visitor to that part of the South below North Carolina could see alligators in almost every stream and bayou , but now one may frequently spend months traveling through this region and not see a single alligator except those in captivity . The killing of the creatures for sport or for their hides has been the main cause of their great decrease in numbers . In addition thousands of the young have been killed or shipped away , while enormous numbers of the eggs have been gathered and sold as curios .  It was not until about 1855 that the demand for alligator leather became of importance . The market was not long continued . In 1869 fashion again called for the leather for manufacturing into fancy slippers , traveling bags , belts , card cases , music rolls , etc . The demand has continued to the present and many thousands of the animals have been killed , while the preparation of the skins has given employment to hundreds of people .  The output of the tanneries of this country approximates 275 ,000 skins annually , worth about $425 ,000 , part of which come from Mexico and Central America . It is estimated that about 3 ,800 ,000 alligators were killed in Florida alone between 1880 and 1909 , nearly 20 ,000 being killed in 1908 .  The earliest settlers in the Southern States found alligators , or , as they were then called , crocodiles , exceedingly abundant in almost all streams , especially in Florida and Louisiana . Many marvelous tales are found in the early chronicles of the ravages of these monsters . They were said to eat dogs and pigs , and to consider the negro an especially succulent tidbit , while it was considered dangerous to go into streams where they were known to exist . When such a stream had to be crossed hours were spent sometimes in beating it to frighten off the alligators .  The researches of scientists have shown that there is very slight foundation for such stories , and it is probable that the greater number of pigs lost by the planters could have been traced to other enemies , particularly the two-footed kind , while runaway slaves would naturally encourage the belief that alligators had dined off them .  The greater part of the supply of alligator leather now comes from Florida , and owing to excessive hunting the industry is profitable only in the central part of the peninsula , in what is called the Lake Okeechobee region and in the Everglades . Here the principal hunters are Seminole Indians , who have their homes on hummocks far back in the Everglades and come to the settlements only when in need of articles which they cannot produce themselves .  The alligator is most active at night , and his days are usually spent lying on some low bank or log overhanging the water , where it can enjoy the warmth of the sun and be able to retreat to its native element at the first sign of danger . While on land alligators are very clumsy , in the water they are exceedingly active , and , being strong swimmers , are able to catch the larger fish with but slight trouble . For animals like the muskrat and otter swimming across lagoons they are always on the watch .  On seizing its prey the alligator sinks with it to the bottom and there remains until all struggling has ceased; it is then able with less effort to tear it into pieces . While thus submerged a peculiar collar at the base of the tongue prevents the water from passing into its lungs .  While the alligator is said to make very effective use of its tail in warfare , the widely disseminated story that it uses its tail to sweep animals off the banks into its jaws appears to have but slight foundation in fact .  In April or May the mother alligator seeks a sheltered spot on a bank and there builds a small mound with a hole in the middle . The foundation of this mound is of mud and grass , and on these she lays some eggs . She then covers the eggs with another stratum of grass and mud , upon which she deposits some more eggs . Thus she proceeds until she has laid from twenty-five to sixty eggs . The eggs are hatched out by the sun .  As soon as they have chipped the shell the baby alligators are led to the water by the mother , who provides them with food , which she disgorges . Papa Alligator has to be carefully watched at this time , for he highly esteems a dinner of young saurians , and is not particular whether they are his own or his neighbors children . When by strategy or downright fighting the mother has got her family safely into their natural element it is not long before the young scatter , each to begin life on his own hook . At this period they form a favorite food for turtles and the larger fishes .  When fully grown the alligator is about sixteen feet in length . In the adult stage it is greenish-black above , having lost the yellowish color bands that belong to its earlier years . Hunters say that alligators grow very slowly , attaining the first year a length of about one foot . When two feet in length they are said to be from ten to fifteen years old , while those twelve feet long are supposed to be seventy-five or more . Their normal life is estimated at from one hundred to one hundred and fifty years .  Alligator hunting originally began as sport . Then some one tanned the skin and found that it could be put to commercial use . Carried on as it must be , at night , the hunt is picturesque .  In many places the hunters fasten bicycle lamps on their caps , and when the animal is attracted by the light pick it off by hitting it in the eye with a rifle ball . Torches are often used . Sometimes the hunter lures the alligator to the surface of the water by telephoning to the gator , as it is called .  An alligator is always attracted by the peculiar grunt which the young alligators make , for there is no sort of food they love better than newly hatched gator . The hunter takes a long , slender pole and lets one end of it down very quietly into the water . The other end he places between his teeth and imitates the grunt of the baby gators . The old fellows easily hear the call and come up to feast on babies they think are there .  In catching them alive hunters frequently lasso them while asleep on the bank or on a log . When asleep in their holes in the mud they are occasionally drawn out by means of an iron hook . These holes are easily found . Sometimes the grass is set afire and the animals lassoed as they seek the water .  After the alligator is caught the hunter in sport sometimes mounts it , using the reptiles fore feet and legs as reins . It is needless to say that it is only by the exercise of considerable skill that the hunter keeps his seat through the struggles of the reptile , and if care is not used the fun may develop into tragedy .  Alligators three feet and more in length are generally killed at once and the hide removed . All of the hide except the ridge of the back , which is very bony , is used . The hide is salted , and is then in condition for sale to the buyers , who are usually storekeepers , who furnish provisions and ammunition in exchange .  The hides range in value to the hunter from 20 cents for a three-foot hide to $1 .25 for a hide seven feet or more in length . The five and six-foot hides are the most desirable , as the larger hides have a hard piece of bone in the square checks on the hide , and it is impossible to sew through this . Nearly all of the tanning is done at Newark , N . J .  Young alligators are often brought in , and are worth about 8 cents apiece . The eggs are also gathered , and sell for 2-1/2 cents each . They are mainly sold to curio dealers , who either hatch them out or blow them and sell the shells . Most of the small alligators are stuffed and sold as curios to tourists , who pay from 50 cents to $2 apiece for them .  Many of them used to be shipped North alive by tourists as presents . Owing to ignorance as to how the animal should be cared for many of these soon died .  If properly cared for , the young alligator will thrive even in unnatural circumstances . Its main requirement is sufficient heat . Its diet should consist of bits of fresh meat , insects and worms . They often show great fondness for the ordinary earthworms , and will frequently refuse all food but these . The larger specimens in captivity are fed about three times a week on fresh meat or small live animals , and they require little attention other than this .  Alligators teeth , which are secured by burying the head until they have rotted out , are of fine ivory and valued for carving into ornaments . They are worth to the hunter about $2 a pound--from fifty to seventy-five teeth . The dealers will not buy very many of them , as there is but a limited demand . At one time the paws were saved and mounted as curios , but it is impossible to do anything with them now .  Both flesh and eggs are eaten by a few persons , but it requires a very hardy stomach to stand the disagreeable , musky odor . There is nothing better , hunters declare , than the tip of the tail of an alligator which has reached , say , the pullet period . It is creamy in color , tasting a little like frogs legs , but with a more pronounced gamy flavor , juicy--altogether tempting . The dish is a great favorite with the crackers of Florida .  Alligator tails are best at the time of the ricebird season . The big alligators float in the water with only their eyes showing . When an alligator gets near a flock of these fat , juicy little birds it dives to the bottom . Its long , wide snout scoops up some of the loam , and it floats to the surface again with just the rich soil showing .  The birds think it is an island . They alight upon it . When the whole family is there the big beast turns suddenly . Just as the birds scramble off the alligator opens its mouth once . They are gone .  The birds are neat little feeders , and the alligator is an epicure at this time of the year . The ricebird diet makes the tip of its tail tender and sweet .  In St . Augustine is an alligator farm , one of two in the United States , the other being at the Hot Springs in Arkansas . Here the alligators are kept in confinement until large enough for market .  It will probably be news to many that Florida has a representative of the crocodile family . This animal was first supposed to be confined to the West Indies and South America , but it has been occasionally captured on the peninsula of Florida . It is easily distinguishable from the alligator by its narrow snout . For many years scientists were skeptical of reports from Florida of the appearance of this animal in that State , but the capture of several fine specimens in recent years has settled all doubt .     VENOMOUS FISH .   It is curious that while so much has been written in our language on snake bites there has been comparatively little placed on record concerning the stings of fishes .  Snake bites are rare in this country , but fish stings are very common , especially among fishermen and fishmongers . The fishes that most often sting are the great and little weevers . A prick on the hand or foot from a weever causes much swelling and inflammation .  If the arm is affected the inflammation may spread to the shoulder , the swelling of the whole limb being enormous . The pain is agonizing , the patient often falling into a state of collapse or becoming delirious . Usually the inflammation subsides in about three days , followed by desquamation .

NICK CARTER WEEKLY ,             DIAMOND DICK WEEKLY ,            BUFFALO BILL STORIES ,           BRAVE AND BOLD WEEKLY ,          MOTOR STORIES ,                  Name  Street     City  State      A GREAT SUCCESS!!  MOTOR STORIES   Every boy who reads one of the splendid adventures of Motor Matt , which are making their appearance in this weekly , is at once surprised and delighted . Surprised at the generous quantity of reading matter that we are giving for five cents; delighted with the fascinating interest of the stories , second only to those published in the Tip Top Weekly .  Matt has positive mechanical genius , and while his adventures are unusual , they are , however , drawn so true to life that the reader can clearly see how it is possible for the ordinary boy to experience them . I   Ed Dukas was writing letters . Someone or something was also writing--unseen but at his elbow . It was perhaps fifteen minutes before he noticed . Conspicuous at the center of the next blank sheet of paper he reached for , part of a word was already inscribed:  Nippe  . . .  The writing was faint and wavering but in the same shade of blue ink as that in his own pen .  Ed Dukas said Hey ? to himself , mildly .  The frown creases between his hazel eyes deepened . They were evidence of strain that was not new . The stubby forefinger and thumb of his right hand rubbed their calloused whorls together . Surprise on his square face gave way to a cool watchfulness that , in the last ten years of guarded living , had been grimed into his nature . Ed Dukas was now twenty-two . This era was hurtling and troubled . Since his childhood , Ed had become acquainted with wonder , beauty , hate , opportunity and disaster on a cosmic level , luxury , adventure , love . Sometimes he had even found peace of mind .  He put down his pen , leaving the letter he had been writing suspended in mid-sentence:   . . . Pardon the preaching , Les . Human nature and everything else seems booby-trapped . They drummed the idea of courage and careful thinking into us at school . Because so much that is new and changing is a big thing to handle . Still , well have to stick to a course of action .         *       *       *       *       *  Now Ed sat with his elbows on his table , that other , no longer quite blank , sheet of paper held lightly in his hands . He sat there , a stocky young man , his hair cut short like a hedge , the clues of his existence around him: student banners on the walls; a stereoptic picture of his track team--in color of course; ditto for his astrophysics class; his bookcase; his tiny sensipsych set; and the delicate instruments that any guy who hoped to reach the next human goal , the nearer stars , had to learn about .  His girls picture , part of any youths pattern of life for the last three centuries , smiled from beside him on the table . Dark . Strong as girls were apt to be , these days . Beautiful in a rough-hewn way . But even with all that strength to rely on , he was worried about her more than ever now . Times were strange . He glanced at her likeness once . Then his gaze bounced back to the paper in his hands .  His nerves tingled at the eerie thing that was happening there . He didnt know whether to feel afraid of it or hopeful . Man was stumbling toward ultimate mastery of his own flesh and the forces of the universe . But the distance remained enormous , though technical science was moving forward , perhaps too swiftly , on all fronts . Part of Eds fear before the unknown was like the stage fright of an inexperienced actor . You never quite knew what was ahead or how to judge anything strange that you saw .  Nippe . . . .  At the end of the line which made the e there was a tiny speck of blue ink . Almost imperceptibly , like the minute hand of a clock , it crept on , curving and looping to form another letter .  Nipper the word was now .  This could be somebodys funny gag , Ed thought . Somebody with a gadget . The world is full of gadgets these days . Maybe too full .  It occurred to him that a pal might be playing a joke with some simple device bought in a novelty store . But probability leaned toward something deeper and more costly . Who knew ? Someone might have invented a way to make a man invisible . You didnt deny that anything could be , any more .  Speak up! he ordered softly .  But no answer came , and his wondering gaze found nothing unusual in the room around him . He froze . Nipper . It could be part of a message , an honest attempt to convey vitally important information . Or it could be the forerunner of violence aimed in his direction . Through no fault of his own , he had had enemies for ten years . Tonight they might really act . To die was still possible . In spite of vitaplasm . Or the more tedious method that employed natural flesh . Or the tiny cylinders hidden away in vaults . Lives were now in danger again . Human , and almost human . . . .  For a moment Ed wanted to give a warning and to call others into consultation . He wanted to shout , Dad! Mom! Come here!  He didnt do so . Between him and the precise , benign personality that he called Dad there was a gradually growing barrier . And for his mother , beautiful and young by art and science , he had that feeling of male protectiveness that takes the form of keeping possible dangers hidden .  Ed decided to work on his own . Being essentially careful and slow moving when it came to delicate processes , he had not touched that creeping droplet of ink . Its secret might thus be destroyed . No , hed never do a thing so foolish .  Swiftly he folded the paper and fastened the writing under his microscope . The ink speck was almost dry now , and nothing was hidden in it . The line of the writing itself was odd under magnification . Here and there it showed tiny , irregular dots at spaced intervals , connected by fine , dragging marks . That was all .  Of course he realized that Nipper might be only the first cryptic word of a message and that he had only to wait and see what would follow .  Until he began to wait , however , the significance of the word itself eluded him . A childs nickname was all that it suggested .  But now his mind bore down on it . And he had the answer almost at once . A small boy climbing the wall of a pretty garden . And his casual christening by a pleasant stranger who met him thus for the first time . Among more vivid and significant details , the memory of the name itself had been mislaid . But Ed Dukas knew that in his boyhood one person had always called him Nipper: Uncle Mitch Prell , and nobody else . Now it seemed like a secret sign .  Ed gulped , his reaction suspended somewhere between shocked pleasure and a frosty sense of eeriness . To have a friend , whom he had loved as a child , vanish into space and into apparent nonexistence after becoming a fugitive , and then to have what seemed to be this friend try to communicate again after ten years , and in this weird manner--well--how would you say it ? Ghosts , of course , were pure superstition . But in this age one could still react as if to the supernatural--with tingling hide and quickened heartbeats . In fact , with the vast growth of technology , more than ever was such a feeling possible .  Uncle Mitch! Ed Dukas called quietly .  Again there was no reply . The name on the paper still could be somebody elses trick . Grangers , maybe . There were ways for him to have learned a nickname . Many people might admire Granger as much as others despised him . And it was hard to say what he might do , or when . Or how , for that matter . He was clever . And wrong .  There was still another thing to remember . Ed did not altogether love the memory of his uncle , Dr . Mitchell Prell . For this famous scientist was marked with the stigma of responsibility for a terrific mishap . No , Prell did not bear the burden alone . There were other scientists , it was said , who had poked too roughly , and with too sharp a stick , into Natures deepest lair . Nature had snarled back . Ed had grown up with the public hate that had resulted . He had fought against it , yet he had felt it , until sometimes he did not know where he himself stood .  Now he waited for more writing to be traced on the paper under the microscope . A minute passed , but there was nothing more . He did notice , however , that the letters of that one word matched roughly the austere handwriting of his uncle .  Once he glanced toward the window with some nervousness . Outside , the night was glorious . Never again would nights be hideous as they once had been . He saw lush gardens under silver light . If any devilish thing not known until recent months slithered through the shadows , it kept hidden . Ed saw other neighboring houses . New trees had grown to fair size in ten years . Older and larger trees remained lopsided and gnarled . But their burn scars had healed .  Otherwise there was nothing left to monument the past--except , perhaps , the sullen mutter of voices in nearby streets .  But Ed Dukass mind , triggered by the name Nipper and by awareness of Mitchell Prell , slipped briefly away from the present . He had often explored memory to find understanding . At school , after the catastrophe , psychiatrists had made every kid do that . So that neuroses might be broken or lessened or avoided . So that animal terror would not draw a curtain over a mental record of an interlude . So that memory might not be lodged , like a red coal of hysteria , in the subconscious .         *       *       *       *       *  Like a trained dog leaping through a flaming hoop , Ed Dukass thoughts plunged back to that zone where his earliest memories faded into the mists of infancy:  A birthday cake with two candles . A fountain splashing in the patio of this same house . A dachshund , Schnitz , which a little boy put in almost the same category as the flat , rubber-tired robots that cleaned the rooms . Where was the distinction between machines and animals ?  Flowers , hummingbirds , and butterflies in the garden . The echoes of footsteps on stone floors . Toy space ships and star ships at Christmas . The star ships were things yet to become real . . . . There was endless interest in life then . But even in those days there were signs of cautious and puzzled guidance .  There was the sensipsych , of course . It was a wonderful box of dark wood in the living room . A soft couch folded down from it . There you lay , and for a moment strange golden light flickered into your eyes . You went to sleep , but you did not really go to sleep . For you became someone else . Maybe a cartoon character in a world where everything looked different . Funny things happened to you that frightened you at first; but then you laughed when you found that there was no harm in them .  Or , instead of being in such a crazy fairyland , you might be a real boy in space armor jumping across the surface of a huge chunk of rock called an asteroid , while stars and a blazing white sun stared at you from blackness . You were very busy helping others to roof the asteroid with crystal , and to put air underneath , and to build houses and factories where people might live and work . Always more and more people spreading out and out to populate the empty worlds of space .  But you were never on that sensipsych couch for very long , or too often . You would wake up , and there was Mom saying , Enough , fella . A little of that sort of thing goes a great way , even when the experiences are rugged and educational and not just whimsical nonsense .  Ed Dukas would be angry and puzzled . For it had seemed that those visions , going on without end , could bring joy forever .  Youll understand sometime , Eddie , his mother would say , consoling him . What happens to you by sensipsych is just make-believe . What we call recorded sensory experience . Some of it really happened to other people . Some of it is just made up . It can teach you things . But too much is very bad . Not so long ago folks found out .  There was something tender and hard and even scared in his mothers words .  Eds dad also had his comments . Dad was something called a minerals expert .  Come on , Eddie , lets rassle , hed say . Stick your chin out , boy . Lets see how tough you can look . No , not mean-tough . . . . Thats better . Weve got to lick the times we live in . And something in ourselves . With machines doing so much for us , life can be soft . And sensipsych dreams are soft . Everything in moderation . Dreams can make you feel as helpless as an oyster . Until you despise yourself and the whole race . Yes , people found out . They were always meant to feel strong and proud , and they must have tasks equal to their increasing powers . Otherwise theres spiritual rot . Weve got to be ready for anything , feel our way , try to be ready to keep our balance for whatever comes . Because life could be terrible , too , if the wonderful forces we control got out of hand . Weve got to go on progressing--moving out to the planets , and then maybe the stars . Got to go either ahead or backward . Cant stand still . And its easy to go backward nowadays . Got to fight that , Eddie , or else there might be a kind of death .  What is death , Dad ?  Eds father would answer his sons serious expression with a gay grin . A kind of myth , now , boy . Just going to sleep and never waking up . We hope its mostly finished , for everybody . Even the disease of old age turned out to be something like rust gathering in a pipe . Simple . It can be fixed up . Some people even let themselves get old . But they can be made young again . Always .  Eddie had other questions .  You were born in the old way , Eddie , his mother said . But so many people are needed now to populate the solar system . So everybody cant be born from his mothers body . Theres another way; almost the same , really . Babies are born--theyre made , really--in a laboratory . Then they live in a youth center , like the one on the hill .  Eddie saw its great white spire looming among the trees . Often he could hear voices in the gardens and playgrounds on the terraced setbacks of its many levels . The voices seemed mysterious somehow .  Even then Eddie sensed the groping and confusion that was in his parents minds . Sometimes his mother would speak fervently to his father: Jack , Id never choose to live in another age . I love it . Because its rich , endlessly varied , exciting . Is that why Im often scared out of my wits ? Even disgusted often enough with my selfish self and all the automatic devices ? I love my work , the planning of pleasant interiors . Im so busy there doesnt even seem to be time for another child . Yet maybe there are centuries ahead , Jack . How does one fill centuries without getting fed up ? And are we supposed to be something superhuman in the end ? Or do we wind up like the ancient Martians and the beings of the Asteroid Planet , before it was blown to millions of pieces ? Wiped out in super-conflict , before they could progress very much further than we are now ?  Most of this went over Eddies head . But it left a smoky tension to lurk in his mind behind the peaceful presence of sun and trees . People had made their world more beautiful for their own relaxed enjoyment . Yet even in those days Eddie sensed the turbulent undercurrent deep inside them .  Once his father expressed a vagrant thought: Maybe we should go out to Venus sometime , Eileen . Start life over more simply in an uncrowded planet thats being conditioned to receive our ancient race . Maybe well do it in just a few years . He grinned .  Yes , Eddies mother replied . If being indefinitely young and alive doesnt fool us before then . If our complicated civilization doesnt crack open and spit fire , and vaporize everybody . Death by violence is still definitely possible . You know , lots of our friends are getting their bodies and minds recorded so that they can be restored in case of serious injury . Maybe we should have done it long ago .  Jack Dukas met her concern with a light tease: A womans worry matched against the stubbornness of a man--eh , Eileen ? Theres something unnatural about being recorded that I rebel against . Dont be too troubled , though . The centuries wont slip from our fingers so immediately . I hardly ever touch a dangerous thing in my work . Besides , safety devices are almost perfect .  Such serious , troubled thoughts did not dim the optimism and eagerness of young Ed Dukas . His private dreams soared into the thrills of Someday . His small hands were impatient to grasp the shadowy shapes of the future , more legendary than the not-distant past with its still-living heroes: Roland , who was largely responsible for the rejuvenation process; Schaeffer , who developed the sensipsych , brought on the dream-world period of decay , and in the end helped Harwell defeat the trap of emasculating visions by urging mankind back toward a vigorous grip on reality; and the hundreds of others who had taken part .  But the first visit of Mitchell Prell , when Ed Dukas was five , was , to the boy , like acquaintance with a legend . Hi , Nipper! were the first words his uncle had spoken to Eddie . Dr . Mitchell Prell was his mothers brother . He was a much smaller man than Eddies dad , and dark instead of blond . He was famous . And he brought gifts .  A piece of the Moon , Nipper , he said . An opal imbedded naturally in gold . For your mom . And this case of instruments dug up in Martian ruins , for your dad . Fifty million years old but better than anything designed by human beings for locating ores far underground . And this for you--also from Mars . I havent been there for a long time . But I got an old friend to send me the stuff--to the labs on the Moon .  Maybe Eddies gift had once been a toy for the off-spring of extinct Martian monsters . It was triangular like a kite , metallic , with a faint lavender sheen . When you whistled a certain way , a jet of air made it rise high in the sky . But it always came back . Atomic power was in it somewhere . For it never ran out of energy .  Uncle Mitch never seemed to say much . He didnt get deep into philosophy . He set up queer apparatus in his room , and a kid could look at it if he didnt touch . And to one of Dads questions he answered briefly , Yes , were making headway in the labs on the Moon . Therell be a motor for star ships . If , in our experiments , hyperspace itself doesnt burst at the seams under that level of power . No , were not yet trying for speeds of more than a fraction of that of light . A trip to a star will take a long time .  It soon came out that Uncle Mitch had another interest . He kept in a glass tube something that squirmed and wriggled , and felt like warm flesh though its natural form , when at rest , was a slender cylinder of pencil size .  About that he would only say , Call it alive if you want to . But not like us . Invented and artificial , and far more rugged than our flesh . For the rest , wait and see if anything comes of it . Maybe itll become the clay of the superman . Schaeffer , here on Earth , is working on it , too .  Uncle Mitch stayed for a week . Then he was gone , rocketing out to the labs , isolated for safety at the center of a mare on the always hidden hemisphere of the Moon .  Mitch knows what he wants and is direct about it , was Jack Dukass comment . Simple . No conflicts . The scientists approach . Wise or stupid ? Who knows ?  Eddie was six , and then seven . The years moved slowly , but he grew and hardened with them . By the time he was twelve , sports and study and awareness of realities had toughened his body and matured his soul considerably . That was fortunate , for this was his and mankinds fateful year . The day came when the household robots were fixing up the guestroom specially for Uncle Mitch again . Dad was afield , a hundred miles away , to look over a vein of quartz crystal that was to be shipped to the lunar laboratories . At 9:00 P .M . Eddies father had not yet returned .  Eddie was sprawled on his bed looking lazily at the translucent blue font of the lamp beside it . The color was rich and beautiful , the carvings snaky and odd . Here was another gift , ordered by Uncle Mitch from a friend in the region of the Asteroids . The font was an artifact of a race contemporary with the Martians who had also lost their fight to master nature and themselves through knowledge . The font had been found floating free in space , among the wreckage of a planet blown to pieces ages back .  Eddie was thinking of such things . He was also thinking of neighborhood pals , to whom he had bragged about his uncle and his expected arrival .  As for what happened at that moment: there was transpatial warning , radioed out fifteen seconds ahead , telling of forces gone hopelessly out of control in the lunar laboratories . But Eddies set was not functioning , and he did not hear it .  Beyond the windows of his room there was just calm , pale moonlight . The Moon looked little different than it always looked , except for the blue spots of the atmosphere domes of the great mining centers .  But then came the intolerable blue-white light . Perhaps , somewhere , exposed instruments measured its intensity . On the roofs of meteorological stations , maybe . Say conservatively that , for the space of a few seconds , it was five hundred times as strong as full sunshine .  Night was broken off . But there was no day like this . For one fragment of a second Eddie glanced at the window . Shadows seemed gone , utterly . Even dark things like tree trunks reflected so much light that they all but vanished in the shimmering glare . As yet , it was a soundless phenomenon .  Eddie shut his eyes and buried his face in his pillow . This reflex action , partly as natural as terror and partly the result of training for emergencies at school , saved his vision . He might have screamed , had he been able to find his voice . Distantly , he heard human sounds that increased the sickness in his stomach . A gentle scene and mood , product of science , had been utterly shattered by forces of the same origin .  He did not see the fuzzy blob of incandescence that bloomed in the sky and expanded slowly for many seconds . In fact , no one saw it; only cameras , fitted with special dark filters , would have been able to do so . For living eyes would have been charred by that splendor .  He heard his mother calling his name . Keeping his eyelids tightly closed and an elbow bent over them , he fumbled his way to the hall , and to her . They dropped to the floor and huddled there .  Outside , voices died away . By then the devilish glory in the sky was fading a little , too , at the edges . Only the heart of the great blob still blazed supernally , with its millions of degrees of heat . Around it was a cooling fog of dust and gases that masked the hell within it .  The world grew still for a few moments , as it does at the center of a typhoon . Then there was a great , soft roaring . The shock wave of expanded , rarefied gases , speeding at many hundreds of miles per second , striking the upper terrestrial atmosphere , and pressing down . Eddie could feel the pressure of it , transmitted by the air--a light but definite punching inward of his flesh , from all sides .  Then there was a distant sighing of wind--air , super-heated and compressed , being forced outward . Next came the resurgence of human sounds , if they were truly that any more .  Someone was yelling , Oh , God  . . . Oh , God  . . . Oh , God . . . . There was a crackle and smell of fire . Something blew up far off .  Then the earthquakes began . With a sharp snap , rock strata far underground broke . Then came a jolt . Eddie Dukas and his mother , huddled on the floor , were engulfed in a swaying sensation , smooth and vibrationless . Then the ground quivered softly . After that , there was a pause , as of something hanging precariously for a moment at the jagged lip of a chasm . Suddenly the pathetic hold seemed to be broken , and the whole world was seized by a tooth-cracking chatter . A pause . . . . Then it began again .  For a second Eddies mother almost lost her control . She tried to rise . The house! she stammered . Itll fall on us .  Panic and reason fought inside Eddie . No , Mom , he gasped . The house has a steel frame . Itll probably hold together . Outside , we dont know what would happen to us .  They both braced themselves for the next seismic burst . They were both creatures of luxury , science-made . But planning , training , psychology--science it all was , too--had given them ruggedness and courage , a reserve of strength against hysteria--while the earth rattled again and again .  Eddies mom kept saying things , and it was all something like a formula that had been learned , a rote , a parroted incantation: Youre right , Eddie . Weve got to think before we do anything . They always tell us that life is an adventure . Weve got to meet a bigger future or be destroyed , Eddie . Everything takes nerve .  At last the earthquake shocks lessened both in intensity and frequency . Maybe the worst was over .  Eddie risked an eye , and then nudged his mother .  Beyond the undamaged flexoglass of the windows night had returned , red-lit from both sky and ground . The firmament was smeared with a ruddy glow extending in a great curve , beaded with more intense blobs at several points . Dust of the Moon , it had to be . Of its rock and pumice shell . And of its core of meteoric iron . But that sullen effulgence was fading now , as matter cooled and began simply to reflect solar light back to this dark side of Earth .  Yet everywhere outside there was fire . The towering glow in the east--that would be the City , fifty miles away . Destruction and confusion there would be unimaginable . Nearer at hand , trees were aflame--leaves and branches that minutes ago had been cool with greenness now blazed wildly . Mixed with the tumult of voices was the clang of robot fire units .  Eddie rushed to the radio and turned it on , as he had been taught to do in emergencies . You listened; you obeyed directions .  . . . lunar blowup , someone was saying . Follow the usual precautions and measures for radioactive contamination and flesh burns . Rescue and relief units are already in action . Fortunately most of our buildings are not made of combustible materials . . . .  For minutes Eddie was furiously busy , rubbing special salves and lotions into the skin of his entire body . Then , dressed in fresh clothes , he and his mother just stared out of the windows for a while . Outside , metal shapes were at work . Science and civilization were working efficiently to recapture their balance after an upset that might have been the end .  Eddie and his mother explored the house and found it mostly intact . Then incident piled on incident in quick succession . The first of these began with a whimper at the door . Masked with respirators against possible radioactive taints in the outside air , they opened it . A blackened thing without eyes dragged itself inside , quivered once , and lay still . It was death among supposed immortals . The passing of a dachshund called Schnitz .  Eddie was dazed . Child-grief or man-grief had no chance to come to him then . Events moved too fast . There was too much to be done .  A half-dozen people in radiation armor came into the house . At once it was converted into a first-aid station . Hard law and hard drills , blueprinted long before for disaster , came into play . Eddies mother joined the crew . Nor was he left out of it . There was coffee for him to prepare in the kitchen , and rugs and furniture to be cleared away , and equipment to be set up .  He saw blood and death , and hysteria-twisted faces . He saw glinting , complex instruments and apparatus , as the therapeutic methods of the age were applied . There were blood pumps that could serve as hearts and machines to duplicate the functions of kidneys and lungs . There were devices to teleport scattered body cells from a dozen healthy individuals , converting them briefly into mobile energy , and then back into living tissue in the body of an injured person .  Mostly the maimed and burned remained stolid and calm . Luxury had not weakened them . They , too , had known their era and had had some preparation .  Eddie recognized a child of his own age among those who came into his own house: a neighbor boy named Les Payten , the son of a noted biologist . He had big ears and a freckled nose . He wasnt hurt badly . His eyes were inflamed . He hadnt shut them quite quickly enough . He had turned sullen , and his lip trembled a bit . Otherwise he was still full of pepper .  Braggin about your Uncle Mitch now , Eddie ? he taunted . Great stuff , that guy! He and his pal scientists nearly got us all . Better luck next time , huh ?  Young Ed Dukas might have growled back but he did not . As if he too carried a burden of responsibility , his jaw hardened and his cheeks hollowed . His back stiffened , as if to bear the load . He returned to the kitchen . He had not yet noticed any other signs of blame . It was too soon . The shock of cosmic catastrophe had deadened minds . Sometimes prejudice and hatred need a certain leisurely brooding to build them up .  But another raw realization had come to Eddie . As soon as there was a moment to speak to his mother he said , Uncle Mitch was supposed to land in the City spaceport tonight . Its a six-hour run from the Moon . But now hell never get here .  She shook her head . And in her expression there was fury mixed with her sadness .  He didnt think about that very long as he helped carry a stretcher . His mind was on Mitchell Prell--grinning , setting up a lab in the room upstairs , even modeling wax with his swift fingers . He had once molded little heads of Mom and Dad . A lump gathered in Eddies throat for someone who would never be back . Mitchell Prell . Even the name sounded nice .  Then slowly another question came into his mind . Where was Dad ? Hed gone out to that quartz lode and hadnt come back! Funny , thought Eddie , I hadnt even thought about that . Well , it came from taking Dad for granted . Someone never to worry about . Someone always around , like the hills . Eddie clenched his fists to steady himself . No use worrying yet .  Now the torrential rains began . Steam had been boiled out of the ground by heat . Now it was condensing . Helping , maybe , as the radio said , to wash away the poison of the radioactive meteorites and dust that were falling to Earth--wreckage that hours before had been part of the Moon .  Somewhere out in the moaning storm a bell chimed out ten oclock very calmly . It must have been about then that what was left of Jack Dukas was brought home in a truck . Eddie didnt see this happen . He was helping again with the injured . And later , when Les Payten told him , Mom wouldnt let him go into the locked room where his dad had been taken . He almost told her that he had a right . But he did not want to disturb her further .  Eddie was up till 4:00 A .M . By then the rescue crew had left the house and a tentative calm had been restored in the world . The injured were in hospitals , rigged in tents and public buildings . But there were far more dead . Anyone caught more than a step from shelter when the catastrophe had occurred was apt to belong to that endless list . Half a planet had been scorched by heat and radiation .  While the guard-robots rumbled through the rain on their caterpillar treads , Eddie simply passed out from weariness on the floor of the living room . His mother managed to arouse him a little but not enough to send him to bed . Rather , she folded down the twin couches from the sensipsych set . She made her husky young son climb up onto one of them and took the other for herself .  He slept , and his body was refreshed . And he had dreams--not dreams in which he was an imaginary cartoon character; nor was he toiling to make dead asteroids habitable; nor was he enjoying an adventure on some imaginary planet among the stars . No , for the present he had had enough of strain . Instead he lay in grass by a little lake . The sun was bright . There were boats with colored sails , and blue flamingos flying , and odd , elfin music . The sensipsych was not an opiate to fill the emptiness of soft lives now . It was rest; it was honest , relieving therapy .  Young Ed Dukas didnt see the mud-spattered truck arrive , to be parked some distance from the house . He did not see the figure moving in the dense shadows . It knocked cautiously at the front door , waited for a reasonable time , and then went around to the porch in the rear . There skillful fingers worked carefully to release the lock . Massive luggage was lifted without sound inside the door .  Eddie awoke with a small , hard hand shaking his shoulder . His mother was already awake . The light was on . At first only with simple unbelief , they beheld a slight , disheveled figure .  Uncle Mitchs cheek was scraped . His hands were filthy . His recently neat business suit was torn . An old jauntiness about his eyes fought with worry , regret and wariness .  Hello , Eileen , he said . Hi , Nipper .  He received no answer . Somehow even Eddie felt compelled to silence . So his uncle shifted to what was a rarity with him--a kind of historical or philosophical summary .  Progress , he said with a forced laugh . The world government answering the threat of atomic war , years ago . Then the greatest boon of the human race: eternal youth , and deaths defeat except by violence , producing the problem of overpopulation , to be relieved by the colonization of the solar system . Then peace and boredom and the sensipsych dreams leading to decadence , loss of pride in self and even rebellious violence; then the solution of vigorous , realistic action , more and more people to enjoy life , more and more colonies . Then , as we reach out for the stars , this . Life . The great adventure that cant be stopped . The rise from barbarism . Is it even well begun ?  His words , half appropriate and half in supremely bad taste now , as Mitchell Prell well knew--though he had to say them because of the need to say something--still fell into a void of silence and echoed through the house like a cheap speech .  Sighing raggedly , he tried again: Yes , Im alive , Eileen . The ship from the Moon was in space before the blowup happened . We rode ahead of the main shock wave at high speed . So we won through . From the final warning message from the Moon , I gather that trouble started in the warp chambers . The heat and pressure were restrained by the tight space warp for a while , until inter-dimensional barriers ripped wide open . The whole mass of the Moon was in the way . By old standards it couldnt happen; but a lot of lunar atoms went all to pieces in a flare of high energy . The tough part is that we achieved a workable motor principle for stellar ships weeks ago . The blowup came from side line testing .  Once more no words answered Mitchell Prell when he stopped talking . He waited , but his sisters eyes remained cold .  All right , Eileen , he went on at last . Youre thinking that I am one of the specialists who is responsible for this . Surely Im the only survivor among those research men who were on the Moon . But remember this: we werent working on our own . We were hired , under a democratic system , and told what to hunt for . It was the best that could be done , except that the lab should have been put farther away , on some lonely asteroid . Logically , then , we are not solely to blame for what has happened . But it doesnt work that way , Eileen . Under grief and hysteria logic still collapses , even in our time . In a real crisis there continue to be many people who need scapegoats . A collective mishap , the result of a mass desire for more knowledge , then becomes a personal guilt . So Im a fugitive , Eileen .  It was a strange , bitter thing for Eddie Dukas to watch--his mother and uncle facing each other , not friends , his mothers face a hard mask of coldness .  Then , all at once , her icy poise crumbled . Jack isnt alive any more , she said . My husband . Thats the fact that I know best . You with your glib talk , my brother , are one person directly in the chain of events that caused Jacks death . I dont accuse you , Mitch . I just say that I cant look on you now with any pleasure . Thats all .  Then , sitting there on the sensipsych couch , she began to cry . It was painful for Eddie to watch . He had never seen her do that before .  But Mitchell Prell chuckled . He sat beside his sister and put his arm around her . Are things so bad ? he chided . Look , Eileen . People used to consider biological life the deepest secret of nature . Because he was at the top of his local life scale , man would not have been flattered to know that the vital force in him wasnt the greatest , the most indecipherable of enigmas . But its true , Eileen . Year after year weve learned more about cell function , genes , chromosomes , the natural molding of living things , and the final process in protoplasm , which is the spark itself . Men like Schaeffer have been making simple life for years , while they traced out more complex riddles . For a long time theyve been replacing diseased or damaged organs from scattered cells drawn from the bodies of many donors . Now theyve gone further and have grown such organs in a culture fluid , from a microscopic bit of tissue . It is already theoretically possible to re-create an entire man , provided there is a pattern . It was for repair purposes , after possible accidents , that everyone was urged to have his body structure recorded--especially that of his brain . All you have to do , Eileen , is have Jacks record turned over to the same laboratories that do rejuvenation . In two or three years hell come back to you just as he was . Soon there might even be a simpler , better way .  Eileen Dukass laugh was brittle and bitter . A roll of fine , sensitized wire , she said . Kept in a box no bigger than the first joint of a finger . Supposed to be safe in a vault . The pattern of a human being . Well , Mitch , there just isnt any such box for Jack . Or for Eddie or me either , for that matter . We just didnt get around to it . Jack was somehow half against it .  Again there was a silence . For Eddie it seemed to have the quiet of forever in it . No whistling of Dads tunes . No sly winks , or play at being tough . Just memory .  All bodies that are being picked up are being sent through the recorder , Uncle Mitch offered at last . Refined radar does the trick . The finest variations of even brain structure--the mold of mind , personality , and memory--are found and recorded . Wasnt that done for Jack ?  Eddies mother nodded . Only , she stammered , the whole top of his head was charred . There wasnt enough of him left . Oh , you and your damned science , Mitch .  She was weeping again . Mitchell Prell became either cruel or perhaps he spoke in self-defense .  The people that used to neglect things like insurance , he remarked , are still plentiful , arent they ? Oh , well , maybe theres still a sort of way . A makeshift . People are bound to think of it . Let it go for now . Ive got lots to worry about , sister of mine .  Your own skin , for instance ? she challenged him . Why did you come here at all , Mitch ? The scapegoat-seekers will certainly look for you here first .  My own skin , Mitchell Prell agreed . Maybe yours , since you are a relative of mine , responsible for my sins . That is an ancient defect of logic among certain types of people still in existence , Im afraid--if the provocation becomes great enough . The skins of the three of us , my most prized treasures .  He smiled slightly then , and his blue eyes were gentle . Dont worry too much , though , he went on . Ill be gone sooner than most people will even think of looking for me . Ill keep out of sight , not even leaving the house , except after dark . I have some things to deliver to Schaeffer . Then Ive got to get away . Because life goes on , in spite of everything . Im still curious about nature , the stars and some other things . I remain eager for some vast freedom , Eileen--for you and your son , and the rest of the cussed race , whose errant qualities and usually good intentions I share . I see no good in becoming the offering of expiation for an accident that came out of a general human urge to learn that cant and wont be downed .  Something like a truce came then . Eddie Dukas could feel it . Family loyalty was in it and a little of understanding and contrition .  All right , Mitch , was all that Eddies mother said . She kissed his uncles cheek . Eddie knew that it was a womans gesture of armistice .  Fires had died down . Dawn was beginning to show in the patio . The rain had stopped long ago . For no reason Eddies eyes sought out a pool of muddy water in a crack in the flagging . The water was clay colored , as it might have been after any shower . A robin , which had somehow escaped death , was scolding angrily .  Breakfast was eaten listlessly . There were radio reports and orders . Able persons must report to their municipal centers . . . .  Thats for you , Eddie , Mitchell Prell said ruefully . And your mother . While I play hiding rat .  Eddie didnt know whether to hate his uncle or not . There was an inner bigness about that slightly built man that matched some obscure drive that was Eddies own--in spite of his grief .  Watch yourself , sir , he growled stiffly .  The day was a day of searching for corpses , of cleanup , of tentative restoration . At least there would be no smells of death . Pruning machines were already busy on charred treetops . The world was being put back into order , like a disturbed anthill . Grass and leaves would sprout again . The scared faces of younger children--many from the Youth Center were given small tasks to help in the cleanup , since it was not the custom now to hide reality from the young--would smile again . On that day of sweeping the streets with a broom , Eddie Dukas made and lost many a brief friendship . Hello . . . . Goodbye . . . .  Fortunately the poison of radioactivity had not been transmitted to any great extent from across space by radiation alone . Gases and fragments of the Moon that were still falling as meteors bore a taint to the atmosphere; but it was now below the danger level .  Overhead , arching the sky like the Rings of Saturn turned ragged , was what was left of Luna: rock and dust . For an hour its texture veiled the sun , until , near noon , there was almost twilight , like that of an eclipse . That arch was a permanent monument to a night that would be remembered .  There still were hysterical people around . Eddie saw Mrs . Payten , his friends mother . She passed in the street , muttering , Oh , Ronald , you were a beast of a man , but I loved you . Why were you a fool , too ? . . . No record . . . . None . . . .  It had been a subject of neighborhood gossip that Ronald Payten , a large , passive lug , had been a very much hen-pecked husband . His neglect of having a record made of himself might have seemed strange for so noted a biologist . Maybe it was absent-mindedness , professional difference of opinion , or even some backhanded defiance of his wife .  There were moments when the wild taint in young blood and the magnificence of disaster gave Eddie and others almost an outing mood . But toil , sweat and horror soon turned things grim as he worked with the men . His hands were blackened and scratched . But maybe tiredness was balm for delayed shock . Maybe it was thus that he stood at the brief funeral services--for his father , too--with less hurt . The great trench was closed over the corpses , and the thing was done .  Later , back in the house , he struggled with himself somewhat , and said , I know it wasnt your fault , Uncle Mitch .  Eddie had seen stern faces that day , topping trim gray uniforms: regional police . In him was the thought: Harboring a fugitive . One who shouldnt be called that . But who is--now . Because people have taken a beating like never before . Even laws can be changed . Ideas of justice wont stay quite the same .  Have you outgrown my calling you Nipper ? Mitchell Prell asked him seriously . Perhaps . . . . But I still want to show you something .  Young Ed Dukas was no sucker for easy come-ons . But his polite wariness soon dissolved , when , in the room where Mitchell Prell was holed up , he saw that the man who turned to face him was not his uncle . The nose and lips were much heavier . Only the eyes and grin remained much the same , though their general effect was made different by the difference of surrounding features . This man looked like a good-natured mechanic .  Eddies spine chilled . But he gave a sullen snort as the man peeled his face away . Underneath it was Uncle Mitch .  A mask , Eddie . A trick for kids , youd say . His uncle laughed . I spent the day making it up , to help me get around more easily . Thats nothing . The important fact is that it is made of vitaplasm . Remember the bar of it that I once had ? Crude stuff then . Better now . Alive in a way of its own . A synthetic and far tougher cousin to natural protoplasm . Far less susceptible to damage by heat and cold . Self-healing , like flesh . Sustained by food and oxygen . But capable of drawing its energy from sunlight or radioactivity , too . And in some of its forms less dependent on a fluid base such as water . No , its not consistently the same substance , or combination . Like the flesh we know , vitaplasm is in constant change . Here and now its just an amorphous mass , crudely molded . An unshaped building material . But , like star ships , it belongs to the future . Here its undeveloped principle , another phase of our advancing science everywhere . You could call it the clay of the superman , Eddie . I want you to remember all this . Because I may be back from where Im going to try to go . Or I might get in touch sometime . We might need each others help .  Young Ed Dukas listened with intense interest . Perhaps his deepest drive was toward the shadowy splendor of times yet to come . They seemed a part of his growing self . They must become real! And he must take part in their fulfillment . Grief or hardship could not stop him . Therein he and Mitchell Prell traveled the same road .  You didnt invent vitaplasm , Uncle Mitch , he stated . No one could have--alone .  His sullenly serious gaze lingered on the mask . It was warm to his touch . It even recoiled a little .  Mitchell Prell shook his head and chortled . No , Nipper . You know that research is now far too complex for that . I helped a little . Lots of men did . Maybe Ive added something to what is known . Ive got to give my data to specialists here before I leave .  Eddie thought of a man hed sometimes seen on television . No bigger than Uncle Mitch . And plain looking . But great . Dr . Schaeffer in his underground laboratory in the City .  You arent going to try to reach a star , are you ? young Ed asked .  Uncle Mitch shook his head . No . I wont wander so far off . He laughed . But in a way Ill be going farther , I suppose . Though dont imagine that I mean time or hyper-dimensional travel . Its something simpler . But its to a place where no one can journey exactly as a human being . I cant tell you much more . Because I dont want other people to try to dig too much out of you . But I want to look at things from a new angle . And from very close up , you might say . Maybe Im trying to hide from danger , Eddie . Some . But the bigger reason is that I want to go on learning and exploring . Maybe my being a small man means something , too .  Mitchell Prell ended with another light laugh . He put the mask in his pocket and snapped a large suitcase shut . When he spoke again it was on a slightly different tack: You probably wont see me for a while , Eddie . About your father , words just arent any good at all . Maybe Ill ache over his end even harder than you . If anybody asks you questions about me , tell all you know . Dont try to hide anything for my sake . Theyll pry it out of you anyway . And theyll only know what I want them to know .  Your mother may get a letter in a few days asking you both to report to the City . If that letter comes , see that she conforms to its request . It will also mean that Ive delivered the results of my experiments with vitaplasm , as far as theyve gone , into the proper hands and have probably succeeded in getting away into space . I hope that you and I and everybody make it to the Big Future , Eddie . Thats all I have to say . Unless you care to remember a word that may crop up again--android .  Mitchell Prell grinned reassuringly at his nephew and moved to put on his mask .  You dont want to say goodbye to Mom , Eddie stated , half angrily .  Prells look of concern deepened . His thin face was touched by a fleeting tenderness and worry . Part of it was surely for his sister . Then , mostly to himself , he muttered , Theres greater magnificence to come--if we can grow past the infancy of man; if new knowledge and old wild impulses dont do us all to death first . He chuckled sheepishly . You say goodbye for me , Eddie , he urged . I hate things like that .  Mitchell Prell was gone then , out into the weird new night . Grimly , already half a man , young Ed Dukas watched him go , bitterness and grief , hatred and love , mixed up inside him . But the common denominator between himself and his uncle was the need for that future of stars and wonder and legendary betterment .  It will happen , he promised within himself . For a second his body was taut with dread . He had already experienced the fury that knowledge made possible , and he could sense the potential of long silence beyond such things--no one left , anywhere! He wondered if , because life could go on and on now , it was more precious and death more terrible .  Fifteen minutes after his uncles departure a spy beam was put into operation from a mile distance . It covered the rooms of the Dukas house and the grounds around it . The principle of the device was almost ancient . The reflection of electro-magnetic waves . On a small screen in a distant room the plan of a house and its furnishings was outlined in a pale green glow . Shadowy blobs shifted with the movements of its occupants , robot and human . Only two people were there now .  Eddie Dukas guessed that the spy beam was there , though its irregularly changing wave length would have made it almost impossible to identify , among the waves from many sources used for communication .  Early on the third morning after the lunar blowup the police came to the house . They were very gentle . There was even a policewoman to ask the questions .  Eddies mother was cool and wary .  Have you information as to the whereabouts of Dr . Mitchell Prell , Mrs . Dukas ? she was asked . We know that the last Moon rocket landed with him aboard .  Before she could lie Eddie blurted , He was here all that day . Hes gone now . He didnt make his destination very clear .  Eileen Dukass eyes widened with panic and surprise . She had expected Eddie to be more discreet .  You have no right to question my son! she stated coldly .  Mrs . Dukas , she was informed , when there is an investigation of the deaths of two hundred million people , we have more than the right to question anybody .  Young Ed was scared . But he felt some of the hero-impulse . Or the desire to follow faithfully the instructions of his idol , Uncle Mitch .  If you psych my memory , what little I know will come clearer than if I just told it , he challenged .  This was done forthwith , out in the police car parked in the street . When the helmet of the apparatus was removed from Eddies head , the police had certain comments of Mitchell Prells to study . Possibly they could puzzle out some of their hidden meaning . But this couldnt have satisfied them very much .  The next day the letter Prell had mentioned arrived . At least it could be assumed that it was the one . Uncle Mitch had managed to make one step of his purpose anyway! Under the heading of Vital Section , Schaeffer Laboratories , it said:       MRS . DUKAS:       Will you kindly report at your earliest convenience to the      above section . This is of greatest importance . Please bring      your son .       Sincerely ,       DR . M . BART  Ed was both cold with tension and hot with eagerness . The following day he and his mother were in the battered City . Fire had scarred it . A boiling tidal wave had washed over portions of it . But the great building over the many subterranean levels of the Schaeffer Labs had stood firm . Quakes had not broken it down .  An elevator took them below , to that steel- and lead- and concrete-shielded place which might have resisted for a while even a noval outburst of the sun . They were requested to lie down on something like sensipsych couches . A voice--maybe Dr . Barts--spoke to them from a swift-gathering dream: Think about Jack Dukas . Your husband . Your father . Things he said . His manner of speech . His expressions , gestures , temperament , likes and dislikes , hobbies , jokes , skills . The people that he knew . Their faces and mannerisms . As many of them as possible will be contacted and psyched like this , too . Think of his memories told to you . Think of everything  . . . everything  . . . everything . . . .  For Eileen Dukas it must have been much the same as for her son . Pearly haze seemed to float inside Eddies mind . Like a million bits of ancient news clippings always in motion , his recollections of his father seemed to burst in a thousand ever-shifting fragments within his brain . He felt an awful compulsion to recall . It sapped his strength until all consciousness faded away . Yet before this happened he knew that the probing would go on and on .  The next thing he knew he was sitting groggily in a pneumatic tube train , with his mother , all but exhausted , too , leaning against him . Almost as an afterthought , their own minds and bodies had been recorded there at the laboratory . They seldom exchanged questions or speculations afterward about what had happened to them . It had been a dream . Let it be a dream .     II   Life had become hard enough for Eileen Dukas and her son . While most people treated them all right--from some they even received exaggerated kindness--there was , very often , a certain disturbing expression in eyes that looked at them .  Les Payten , Eddies friend said once , I promise , Ed . No more talk about your uncle from me . Finished , see ? Youve had enough .  Eddie suppressed the anger which sprang from loyalty to Mitchell Prell , for he understood Les Paytens good intentions .  At regular intervals there were police visits at the house , and questioning . Its partly for your protection , Mrs . Dukas , was one honest comment from the detectives . But Eddie sensed that there was more to it than that . Subtly , the interpretation of law had changed since the lunar blowup . It went backward , as grief sought people to blame . Catastrophe had been too big for reason or fairness . And the scapegoat himself was not around to be mobbed .  A freckle-faced brat from the Youth Center--her name , Barbara Day , had been drawn out of a hat , for of course she had no known parents--offered advice: You ought to go far away , Eddie , where folks dont know you . It would be better .  Ed knew that this was good advice . Many people were saying and shouting and whispering that too much knowledge was a dangerous possession . And Eds uncle still represented such a thing . More than once Ed had to run fast , with some big lug chasing him . Black eyes he collected with great frequency , and delivered some , too . Still , he ached inside . It was as if Uncle Mitch were part of him .  The world began to look normal and green again . But the undercurrents of memory were still there . And Ed Dukas began to answer hate with hate , though he didnt like to .  There was a crowd of young toughs with rocks to throw , in front of the house one night . This is the place , Eddie heard one of them say . Both my parents are gone . And the bums that live here were in on the reason .  Ed had seen the boy around before: Ash Parker . Now the rocks flew for a while , and Ed and his mother crouched behind locked doors . There might have been a lynching , except that Les Payten found a neighbor with a tear-gas vial and some other neighbors with sharp tongues and courage .  It was the final straw , however . Will we have to leave , Eddie ? his mother asked .  Its best , he growled . But Ill be back!  Next day the house was being boarded up . Packing began even before the colonial travel permits were prepared .  It was goodbye to Les Payten and Barbara Day , and the newly ringed planet , Earth , with its billions of inhabitants and its great shops that still worked to give the whole solar system to mankind and maybe a segment of the larger universe as well . The pattern of the future seemed set , and specialists still didnt think that there was any real reason to make a change . In fact , they denied that any change was possible . Nobody would give up the threshold of immortality , once it was gained . Nor would they relinquish other triumphs that could bring idleness and decay if they were not used to accomplish bigger and bigger tasks . So , even the fearful ones were caught in the rushing current of the times .  Ed Dukas was soon on a crowded liner . Because she might need him , he kept close to his mother . Around them were other colonists--young graduates from technical schools , newlyweds and people who were physically young , too , though they were fresh from the rejuvenation vats . They were the aged , awed by another lifetime before them .  The liner blasted off . A week later it landed on an asteroid of middling size . The Dukases were assigned to one of a group of trim cottages that were not even all alike . Under the great glass roof , which kept in the synthetic air , the new gardens and fruit trees were already growing . And in coiled tubes of clear plastic filled with water , circulated green algae from which almost any kind of basic food could be made .  To Eddie it was a satisfying dip into space that he had so much anticipated . Amid great heaps of steel and plastic and house parts and atomic machines to maintain a normal temperature so far from the sun , life went on . Eddies mother worked in the office of a shop for robot machines . He worked too--when and where he could--when he was not at school .  There was a little more of peace , for a while anyway . There was the usual psychological treatment to subdue possible devils of the lunar catastrophe which might remain in his mind . There were sports and an artificial lake to swim in with his companions . However , Ed Dukas was wary of making deep friendships .  He was then a sullen , overly matured youth of thirteen , earnest about everything he did--for he knew that the years ahead were grimly earnest . Carefully he kept up with the reports in scientific journals: about the laying of the keel of the first star ship on a minute asteroid with only a number and no name . Harwell was in charge . The propellant would be pure radiant energy--the best of them all; energy so concentrated that it would be truly massive and hurled at the speed of light , which was not remarkable , since it would be light , far more intense per unit area than the noval explosion of a star!  This was by no means the only major advance that had been accomplished and was reported . Technological progress was steady in all fields , across the board , making a solid front . Others of its facets also had a special appeal to Ed Dukas . Biological science , in its newest interpretations , he knew to be the most important of these . Now it was no longer just simple rejuvenation--restoring rusty organs . It was a thing that could start from a single cell , in warm , sticky fluids , giving rebirth to something that had already been . And it had a further development--bringing the same results but more swiftly and easily , and with different , far more rugged flesh . It was frightening and fascinating . Knowing was like feeling the shadow of a demon or an angel .         *       *       *       *       *  Ed Dukas and his mother spent four years on their asteroid . Then one day a letter fluttered in her hand . And she seemed not to know whether to look happy or terrified . She did not show her son the letter .  Weve had enough of being here , she stated . Were going home .  So they went back across the millions of miles . They cleaned up the house , on which obscene insults had been scribbled in chalk . On two successive days Eddie was jumped by gangs . He fought free and escaped . But on the third evening he was cornered . This time Ash Parker was the ringleader . Ed battled like a bobcat , but eight opponents were too many . He was flat on his back , and they were kicking him . His own blood was in his mouth . What might happen when he blacked out was anybodys guess . Once , before medical knowledge had advanced to where it was , it would have been murder for sure .  Somebody intervened--a big guy in a gray business suit who had come striding along the block with an eager attention .  He didnt say anything at first . He just collared the toughs , two at a time in swift succession , and thrust them away .  Eddie staggered up and faced his benefactor , intent on giving him sincere thanks . Mister  . . . I  . . .  Hello , Eddie! the man said , chuckling . I see you turned out hardy . Seventeen youd be now .  Young Ed Dukas heard the voice and looked at the face . He stiffened . Then he made a statement in a flat tone that sounded very formal and unemotional , which it was not: Sir , youre my father .  The man nodded . Just off the assembly line , pal . The same guy--because you and your mother , and some other people , remembered what I was like . There was no record of me or of my mind . So , okay , they made one , fella . From the memories of me left in other minds . Thanks , Eddie .  Thanks ? Ed Dukas said in a choked voice .  Bloody and dirty , he stepped forward . Father and son clung to each other . It was a moment of great triumph .  Eds mind pictured filaments , as fragile at first as pink spiderweb but already outlining a human shape , held suspended in a kind of jelly--growing there , forming according to a record . Now even the record could be synthesized . It seemed like real freedom from death at last .  Ash Parker had not fled . Now he spoke , sounding awed , Jeez , Mr . Dukas . I didnt believe it . Maybe my folks can come back , too .  Your parents will come back , Jack Dukas affirmed . I am the first memory man to be resurrected . Among those killed who had had their bodies and minds recorded as was recommended , about a hundred thousand are alive again , as I think you know . Millions more are in process . One way or another , by record or by the memories of others , in flesh of the old kind or the new , almost everyone will return .  Ed felt his fathers hand . As far as he could tell , it was of flesh . Yet it could be something else; Ed nearly trembled with excitement as his eager wonder and primitive dread of the strange battled inside him . He thought again of Mitchell Prells first samples of vitaplasm .  Of which flesh are you , Dad ? Ed asked anxiously .  His father studied him there in the twilight of the day , while the silvery ring of lunar wreckage brightened in the sky .  The old kind , Eddie , he answered .  Im glad , Ed said , feeling greatly relieved , a reaction which he knew was odd for one who loved the thought of coming miracles .  Jack Dukas sighed as if he had escaped a terrible fate . So am I glad , pal , he said . I guess I was favored by family connections . Here he paused , but his wink meant Uncle Mitch . However , he continued , the old flesh takes so much longer . Thats why in many cases it wont be used . There must be thousands of androids already among us , living like everybody else . Since personal concerns are involved , statistics are kept rather confidential . These synthetic people have organs the same as we have . And you cant recognize them just by looking . Only theyre thirty per cent heavier , stronger , and they dont tire . There was a thought , once , that robots would make human beings obsolete and replace them . Sorry , Eddie . Why be gruesome at a time like this ? Lets patch you up and then find your mother .         *       *       *       *       *  Young Ed Dukas was happier than he had ever been before . For quite a while he found peace . Maybe that was true of most of humanity now--for the past three or four years at least . There was no sharp delineation of an interval before the smokes of doubt began to come back .  Les Payten was still around . And Barbara Day continued to live at the Youth Center on the hill . Often the three would meet . Their childhood was behind them . Barbara Days freckles had faded . Her dark hair had a coppery glint . A promise of beauty had begun to blossom . And her talk expressed many whimsical thoughts .  We all know each other , Eddie , she once said . So dont be offended . I sometimes think that you wonder whether your father is really the same person that he was--whether he ever could be more than a careful duplicate .  Les Payten frowned . Youre speaking to me , too , Babs , he pointed out . I also have a memory father . Hes good to me , and mostly I like him . But sometimes I get scared , though I dont always know why .  Eds skin tingled . Could I be myself now and still be myself in another body , years later ? Could there ever be two of me--truly--constructed exactly the same ? I dont deny such a thing . I simply dont know .  But Ed Dukas continued to wonder about his father . There were several occasions when his dad was supposed to recognize certain people , casually encountered in the street . For they knew him .  Ed was present on one of these occasions . Sorry , friend , Jack Dukas apologized to a burly , jovial man . I guess they forgot to put a picture of you inside my head .  Les Paytens father was also subtly different from his original--though in a somewhat different way . The change was even very dimly apparent in his face . He had once been a big , easy-going , timid soul , nagged by his wife . Now his features bore a hint of brutality . He walked with a slight swagger . He did not roar , but the aura of power was there .  Eds mother explained the change to his father: Memory seems not always to match facts , Jack . Mrs . Payten fooled herself into believing that Ronald Payten used to be a bully . So she even fooled Schaeffers mind-machines . And lo! Ronald Payten is a bully now , as far as she is concerned . No , dont worry about her too much , Jack . She may even like being pushed around .         *       *       *       *       *  In the months that passed , from out on an asteroid came the step-by-step reports of the building of the first huge star ship . At home , one by one , old acquaintances--or was it just their reasonable facsimiles ?--reappeared . Gradually most of the dead of the lunar blowup were restored to life--except for certain scientists who remained unforgiven .  But a new type of population was creeping into the fabric of human society . Its humanness , in an old sense , could be debated . Its first quiet intrusion was marked by an awe that faded into a shrug; it began to be accepted casually and somewhat dully , as most past novelties had been accepted before . Foresight could extend into tomorrow , but its pictures remained not quite real . The skills of cool , clear thinking , which education tried to impart in an era that needed it so much , fell short again . No doubt it should have been remembered that the shift from inattention to unreasonable panic can often be swift .  Even young Ed Dukas , though dedicated in his heart to New and Coming Things , sometimes lost sight of these deeper concerns because of his lighter interests . Without much help from art , Barbara Day turned out to be beautiful . She had a pair of suitors automatically . Ed could have had his stocky frame lengthened . Les Payten could have had his big ears trimmed . But young men often frown on the vanity of tampering with ones appearance . Sometimes there is even a certain pride in minor ugliness .  They all had their dates , their dancing , their canoe rides--traditional pleasures , inherited from generations past . And they had the age-old problems of youth approaching adulthood . But now , for them and for their increasingly complex civilization , there was a new problem--vitaplasm , which could be grown like flesh , though faster , impressed with a shape , personality and memories . It was said that 30 per cent of those who died in the explosion of the Moon lab were brought back in this firmer , cheaper medium . But its use did not stop here . For one thing , there were certain adventurous persons , alive and healthy , who changed the character of their bodies willfully .  One fact some might forget: there were other dead from years before , but remembered and still loved--parents , grandparents . Besides , there were historical characters--Washington , Lincoln , Edison , Cleopatra .  Possibly Joe Doakes could awaken from extinction , puzzled , wondering , frightened , but finding himself at least superficially the same , eating much the same food , enjoying much the same things . Then something super in his body would dawn on him , scaring him more or making him exultant . But it all seemed good at first glance , so a joyful world forgot its times of suspicion , even against the warnings of specialists , and released the new processes to almost any operator who could construct the needed equipment .  The solar system was big; the universe , optimistically promised , seemed endless . There was plenty of room . And the task of bringing back just those who had perished with the Moon was enormous and slow . So in cellars and out-of-the-way places countless biological technicians tried their skill . They could not have made the grade at all if they were stupid , and their results , generally , were good .  The various Julius Caesars and Michelangelos really came into being as novelties , side-show pieces . All were reasonable likenesses , physically . From existing minds such traits and skills as each was supposed to possess could be copied more or less accurately . But none of the pseudo-great amounted to very much . They enjoyed a brief popularity; then , assuming the costumes and customs of a changed world , they sank into nonentity among the populace . Like most of those of the new flesh , they kept this secret as if by intuitive prudence . The many people restored in normal protoplasm were less reticent .  That there were androids around him , known , suspected and unrecognized as such , was a thrilling idea to Ed Dukas . It was part of the onward march to greater wonders--or so it seemed to him most of the time . Eager to understand how they thought and felt , he sought them out cautiously , not wishing to offend . Usually his efforts were met with coolness and evasion--which perhaps gave them away .  But then Ed met a very special memory man . He wasnt the copy of somebody famous . He was just a humorous legend . Yet now perhaps he was the right kind of personality striking against the right sort of circumstances to produce the type of action and fire that could affect the existing era .  Ed and his two friends , Les Payten and Barbara Day , found him in a little park feeding pigeons . Or , rather , he found them . For in conformity with an ancient village belief that no one should be a stranger to anyone else , he grinned at them and said , Hello , there! Nice young fellers . Nice girl! Sit and gab a while ? I keep gettin lonesome . Mixed up . Got to get straightened out . Or try , anyway . Put yourselves down ? Thats fine!  Abashed and curious after that , Ed and Barbara and Les sat and mostly just listened .  Been around these times three months . Scared stiff at first . Thought I was addled . Know somethin ? I can remember all the way back to 1870 . Its a fake , sure . No , they didnt make me look young , or even give me all my teeth . Afraid of spoiling verisimilitude , my great-great-great-something-grandson-supposed-to-be said . Im a family brag . Look what I keep carrying around with me . One of the first editions of Huck Finn . They found this tintype of a feller inside it . Illinois farmer . And look at this here writing in the front of the book . Property of Abel Freeman . So Im supposed to be him , slouch hat and all--funny , I cant get used to anything else . So I write just like that . This tintype and the writing are the only solid clues about what the original Abel Freeman was really like . Up to there , Im him . The rest is mostly storybook stuff , and the idea the family has that their ancestor was a kind of pixilated hellion--the sort some folks like to tell about . Some way for a man to be born , huh ? Shucks , I can even remember the night I was supposed to have died . Drunk , and kicked in the belly by my own mule , because he didnt like my smell . Hell , I bet in real life that mule would of plum enjoyed whisky!  Abel Freeman stopped talking . He turned pale gray eyes set in a face that looked like brown leather toward his audience with expectant amusement , as if he understood the eerie impression hed made on them and was curious about their reactions .  Barbara took the lead . Were surely glad to know you , Mr . Freeman , she said , shaking his big brown paw and unconsciously aping his manner of speech . Im sure you could tell us plum more . Whats the world ever coming to ?  His grip , for an instant , was almost literally like that of a vise . But when Barbara winced with pain , his hand relaxed , and his look became honestly gentle and apologetic , though it retained a certain slyness of tricks being played or unprecedented power being demonstrated .  Oh , excuse me , lady! he drawled . This first Abel Freeman--he was supposed to be a very strong and vigorous man . Me--naturally Im even a lot stronger . Sometimes I just forget . But I try to be right courtly . There , Ill rub your fingers . Hope I didnt break no bones .  Barbara laughed a bit nervously . No , Mr . Freeman--Im fine , she assured him , nodding her dark head . Now , if youll tell us--  Oh , yes--about what the world and everything is coming to , Abel Freeman went on , his tone more languid than his eyes . Well , matters could get mighty rough . Ive been studying up--thinking . When I first got to these times , I didnt like them . Everything seemed addled . Guess I was homesick . I kind of resented being made the cheap way , too . But even way back in the years I remember , they used to say that maybe thered be flying machines or even balloons to the Moon . So I perked up and got acclimated , and said to myself , Abel , my boy , take whats given to you and dont whine , even though you werent asked if you wanted to come here . And with all that can be done now , why not bring your old woman and her chewing tobacco ? And your four ornery sons ? Nat was the worst . And Nancy , your daughter , who was an unholy terror ? Of course this family that you recollect so good probably dont match historical fact so much , being just romanticized , mostly made-up memories put into your head . But theyre plum real to you . Guess when they synthesized you , they should have left those recollections out . Because you love that family of yours , ornery or not , and would be happy to see its members again . And I said to myself besides , Abel , bein made the cheap way has got plenty of advantages . Youre strong as a dozen regular men , and you wont need rejuvenation , because youll never get any older . Youll heal even if youre hurt something terrible . Trouble is , your kindll be some mighty stiff competition for the present holders of the land . Of course people want to get along peaceably--even your sort , Abel . But plenty of folks will wind up trusting your sort no more than theyd trust a billygoat under a line of wash . Yep , Im afraid theres gonna be some mighty interesting days coming!  Abel Freeman ended his conversation almost dreamily . Hed hung his slouch hat on the corner of the bench back . In his iron-gray hair , the sun picked out reddish glints . His gaze , which might have been designed especially for precision squirrel-shooting , wandered down a path that curved along the park lake .  Ed Dukas found him a fascinating mixture of old romance and comedy , artfully concealing the most recent of wonders , the dark channels of which held the potentials of great centuries to come , or mindless silence after destruction . The treachery was not in Abel Freeman himself but in the fact of his being .  Eds mouth was dry . Youre honest , Mr . Freeman , he said .  Abel Freeman answered this with a nod and a shrug . Funny , he drawled . Thought I saw a young feller I was sort of expecting . A congenial enemy , name of Tom Granger . Look , suppose you three sidekicks of mine get on your feet nice and easy , and walk the other way on that path . It would be safer . Not too far . Just a piece .  This might have been an armed robbers command , but Ed sensed that it was nothing like that . Without a word , he led Les and Barbara away .  There was a blinding , blue-white flash . The bench on which they had been sitting was gone--vaporized by fearful heat . Incandescent vapors rose from a big hole in the turf . When condensed and solidified , they would show little flecks of gold transmuted from soil . These were the effects of the familiar Midas Touch pistol . It used lighter atoms to form heavier ones , while it converted a little of the total mass into energy .  Freeman must have leaped away at just the right instant to avoid destruction . With astonishing agility , he was pursuing his intended murderer . As Freeman sprang to the youths shoulders , they both fell in a heap on the walk and slid to a stop . Freemans hand flicked , and the weapon flew into the bushes .  By then Ed and Barbara and Les were standing over the prone forms . Freeman was unruffled .  Friends , he said , laughing , meet up with a young one with a sharp viewpoint and lots of guts in his own way . Yep , Tom Granger .  Granger was panting heavily . His mass of black hair streamed down over his thin face . He looked scarcely older than Ed or Les , but these days that meant little . In repose , his large , dark eyes might have been limpid and idealistic; now they flashed fury . His shabbiness was affected . Certainly , in this era , there were no reasons for poverty .  Now he began to struggle again , in Freemans grasp . Futilely , of course . Yes , I have guts! he declared . I wanted to kill you , Freeman--with whatever means that are left that can still accomplish that with things like you! I wanted the incident to get into the newscast--yes , to give me public attention . And not for any stupid vanity , but for the best purpose there ever was . I wanted a chance to be listened to , while I tell what everyone must have begun to sense by now . Damn you , Freeman! Let me up!  Abel Freeman smirked indulgently and obliged .  Granger rose lamely but gamely . You seem to be impromptu acquaintances of this Abel Freeman , he said to Ed and his companions . He has feelings , he thinks; hes even a good person . In some ways hes just an interesting rogue of the nineteenth century . But hes a device . And unless something is done , well be as obsolete as the dinosaur! Our science serves us no longer . It serves other masters , nearer to its meaning . Others than I have realized it . In every two houses this side of the world there is already an average of one of these creatures of vitaplasm . Is Earth to be kept for us , and for the joy of being human; or are we to become--basically , and no matter how humanized--mere synthetic mechanisms , trading our birthright for a few mechanical advantages ?  The shot from the Midas Touch pistol was drawing a crowd . An approaching police siren wailed .  Suddenly Granger fixed his eyes on Ed in surprise and recognition . Dukas , he said . Let me see--Edward Dukas . At a time when the world was more reasonably watchful , your house was under surveillance . As a possible means of contacting one Mitchell Prell--who had his hand in what once happened to us , and perhaps in what is happening now . How does it feel , Dukas , to be so close to such a celebrity ? Ah , maybe youre shy!  Flattening out Granger again would have been no useful answer to Eds memories of bitter wrongs . He smiled briefly at him .  Come see me some evening when you dont feel so much like making a monkey of someone , because someone has just made a monkey out of you , he said .  Then he hustled his companions away . Theres no good in getting involved in public confusion , he told them . Anyhow not till we talk things out and get them straight .  Ten minutes later they were in a quiet restaurant .  Abel Freeman , Les Payten said . He was quite a surprise at that .  Rather , more of a pointing out of facts we already knew , Barbara remarked .  The old robot-peril come true , Less said pensively . Humanity threatened to be replaced , not by clanking giants of metal , simple and melodramatic , but by beings much more refined--though they are perhaps much the same thing . My own father is one of them .  Theres truth in what Granger said , Ed pointed out . Theres that dread of being shouldered out of the way by something strange and tougher . I can feel it too . Granger can certainly make use of it , preaching . Hes clever . But hes the worst kind of fool .  Yeah , hammering on the detonator cap of the entire Earth , Les said , breathing softly .  The three friends , sitting around a table under soft lights and in pleasant surroundings , looked at one another . The food before them was good , the music was quiet and soothing . But at eye level , in the air where their glances passed , seemed to hang all the elements of the complex civilization to which they belonged: its luxury and beauty , its climbing technology that could conquer death and reach for other solar systems , but by the same or related forces could dissolve worlds , especially if mankind , at the top , lost control of itself .  I thought things would go along smoothly and reasonably , Barbara offered . Theres certainly plenty of room for both people and androids . I took all of that more or less on faith . But Im afraid Im wrong . After all , how can human beings live beside beings that blend indistinguishably with the mass and yet are stronger , quicker ?  Ed remembered signs of friction that hed heard about . A minor riot here or there . He remembered public statements by specialists like Schaeffer admitting that some confusion was on the way but declaring that in the end everything should be better for everyone . Those specialists had the calculators , the great electronic thought-machines , digesting trends , making profound predictions . But then there was another thought--had many of those scientists already converted their own bodies to a stronger medium ?  Ed saw that Les Payten had a faint sweat of strain on his forehead , though he knew that Les was no nervous coward . His sullen poise just after the lunar explosion long ago had proved that .  Maybe the worst of all , Les was saying , is the sense of being carried along , swiftly and helplessly , by things that are too big and complicated . You wish you could find a ledge somewhere in the time-stream and stop for a while to get your bearings . Sometimes you feel that you are in a one-way tunnel where you have to keep moving . Is there light at the end of the tunnel ? Maybe its just a matter of personal adjustment--a taking of whatever comes .  I feel as though were at the threshold of some terrible danger , Ed , Barbara said . What can we do about it ?  He saw how strong and earnest she looked , and it reassured him . He touched her hand briefly . I dont know exactly , he said . But Im for holding course toward the bigger future that stirred me up with big dreams of the planets , of the stars . And Im in favor of being reasonable . Ive seen too much hate and fear and unreason in people . The way things are , it doesnt have to be a lot of people any more--just a few gone a little crazy . The Moon blew up by accident . A world was gone . But what happened by accident can certainly happen by design or with the aid of fury . So , everywhere we go we can talk against fury and panic , and for reason . To our friends , and in the streets . Everywhere that we can , and to everyone . Small as that effort is , it might help .  Solemnly the three friends shook hands and agreed to work out the details of a plan .     III   That same night , at his home in the suburbs , Ed Dukas read an article that had especially attracted his attention . Could vitaplasm be grown into forms unknown before ? Could it be shaped from a plan--a blueprint--like the metal and plastic forming a machine ? Heart here , lungs there , nervous system arranged so ? Scaly armor , long , creeping body ? Or wings that fluttered through the air ? The author saw no reason why this could not happen . Monstrous things . Ed Dukas chuckled at the melodramatic idea . But he suspected that it was far from impossible .  Young Dukas also had a caller that night .  You said I should come to see you , Tom Granger told him when they were alone in Eds room . Ed was on guard at once .  His visitors mood seemed to have changed since the afternoon .  Sorry if I seemed out of line today , Granger said . My motives are good . And I didnt want to insult you .  Thanks , Ed responded shortly . But you didnt come here just to tell me that . How does it happen that youre not in jail ?  Abel Freeman discreetly pressed no charges . I wish he had . But , like you , he just disappeared . There was only that hole in the ground--made by the Midas Touch pistol--a feeble thing to admit for a publicity showdown . So I kept still , and the police couldnt hold me . Fact is , most of them seem sympathetic to what I stand for--the venerable human privilege of walking on ones own green planet as a natural animal , loving ones wife and children in the ancient , simple manner .  Granger was a good orator . Mysteriously , Ed was faintly moved . Perhaps the gentle argument was too plain and clear . But Ed remained wary of the traps of language and feeling , and of perhaps impractical dreams .  His anger sharpened . Then , knowing the possibly deadly quality of anger in these times and wishing to counteract that everywhere , he yearned desperately to be a master psychologist , always calm and smiling and supremely persuasive . But he could not be like that . He was too human and limited . Maybe too primitive .  You still havent told me why you came here , Granger , he said coldly . Why have you passed up a chance for public shouting to come and talk to me ?  Granger smiled . Youre clever enough , Dukas , to know that to win the nephew of Mitchell Prell over to my way of thinking could be to my advantage before that public . Or that , if I cant make friends with him , at least knowing him better might help . Even the latter circumstance could be like having a finger on a whole set of advantages when the showdown between human beings and androids finally comes . Oh , I admire Prell! A great man--if he was a man when last seen! But his kind of greatness is poison , Dukas--though millions with short memories have foolishly forgiven him . But if he ever turns up again , youll know it , and so , perhaps , will I--before he can do any further damage . You surely must realize that he bears a double guilt: for the blowup and for the development of vitaplasm!  Grangers smile was savage and hopeful .  Ed laughed in his face . You think that secretly I might hate Mitchell Prell , eh , Granger ? But he was the idol of my childhood , a whimsical , friendly little man . So Im stuck with loyalty . But even if I hated him blackly , I wouldnt come over to your side . I dont like the way you think . Until the blowup happened , it was bravo for science and empire . Afterward , your hysterical soul was free from blame and white as snow , and he was guilty . Maybe I judge you wrongly . I hope I do . But the way I add it up , its not the androids or any other new and inevitable development that is the big danger; its people like you , though maybe you dont realize it . Loudmouths who stir up confusion , animosity , hatred . Maybe I ought to kill you . Then thered be one less spark in the powder barrel!  Why dont you ? Granger mocked . Thered still be others . And Id be brought back .  Ed nodded . The benefits of our civilization , he said . How would you like to be an android ? Does the idea scare you ? You know , Granger , some people say that , regardless of how youre returned to the living , youre not the same person you were but only a superficially exact duplicate .  You know Id always choose to be human , Dukas , Granger muttered , looking almost terrified .  Sure , Granger , Ed taunted . Youre not afraid of death--the knowledge that science can restore you gives you courage . You can take the benefits of scientific advancement , cant you ? But assuming its responsibilities is another thing .  Im not dodging responsibility! Im grabbing it , Dukas! Im striking out for sane control . Ive done things already! While I worked in the vaults , where personal recordings are kept , certain of those little cylinders disappeared . They wont be found again! Some men dont deserve that much protection against mishap--among them your uncle! Im proud of this , and I boast of it! No , dont accuse me! Even an official complaint would be challenged by many people and then buried in a heap of red tape . I can be a dirty fighter , Dukas; and Ill bite and kill and kick and holler my lungs out to keep this planet from going to the machines!  The wild look in Grangers face was the thing that prompted Ed to action . The admission of the theft only emphasized the ghoulish determination that was there . The only hope seemed in smashing that ego out of existence--for a while at least .  Ed chuckled . So youd take even the essence of peoples selves , he said .  Grangers gaze didnt waver . If every last thing I hold dear--and which I believe most real human beings hold dear in like manner--were in danger , Id do anything .  So would I , Ed said grimly .  Then he struck and struck and struck again . Blood spurted from Grangers smashed lips and nose , as he crashed to the floor , struggled to his feet and fell again .  There was movement at the door of the room . From behind , Ed was gripped by a strength greater than his own . Stop it , Ed , he was commanded quietly . It was his father .  Through bloodied lips , Granger was explaining hurriedly , Your son and I disagree . He lost his temper . All I ask is that the good parts of science--medical and so forth--be kept and the rest banned . And that life become simple . A thing of fields and flowers , and wholesome physical work . And not a mechanized bedlam , full of constant danger and tension .  Granger sounded very earnest , Ed thought . Maybe he was earnest . Maybe he was a good actor .  Ban this , ban that! Ed shouted . No one ever lived happily under the kind of artificial bans you mean , Granger! And what will you do with the billions of people who disagree with your pretty vision ? Some of them will hate what you advocate as much as you hate existing circumstances! And if modern weapons are once used . . . .  Quiet , Ed , his father said softly . Youve assaulted your guest--one who , as far as I can see , has the most reasonable of views . A beautiful picture . I agree with it myself--entirely .  Look , Dad , Ed began . This Granger here is trying to solve todays and tomorrows problems with yesterdays poor answers .  Ed stopped . He had an odd thought: his synthetic father had been created largely from his and his mothers memories , at a terrible time of grief , when his mothers reactions had turned against the groping toward the stars . Before that , Dad had been somewhat averse to mechanization . But now he was distinctly more so , as if that grief and aversion had marked him .  Jack Dukas was now medicating Grangers face with antiseptics while Granger preached , as if from some deep font of a new wisdom: You see , Mr . Dukas , again , as in the past , danger is creeping up on us without receiving serious attention . Beings that are really robots are already controlling part of their own production . Their creation , everywhere , should be banned or stamped out . Existing androids should be converted to flesh or destroyed . . . . Ill go now . Thank you for your help . But I think Ill get in touch with your son occasionally . He needs guidance .  Ed nodded grimly . Perhaps I do , he said . Maybe everyone does . You watch me and Ill watch you , eh ?         *       *       *       *       *  During the succeeding months Ed did his best to spread his doctrine of calm and reason , working against the agitation which he knew was already well under way . Les Payten and Barbara Day were with him in this . All over the world there were others , mostly unknown to them , but with the same ideas: Use your head . . . . Dont put fear before knowledge . . . . Do you know an android ? What is his name ? Maybe Miller or Johnson ? You must know a few . And do they think so differently from yourself ? Yes , there are problems and no doubt prejudice . It may even be justified . But the answers to our difficulties must be cool-minded . Everyone knows why .  Ed and his companions talked in this manner to their acquaintances , spoke on street corners , sent letters to newscast agencies . And they won many people over . The trouble was that they , and others like them , could not reach everybody .  Their Earth remained beautiful . There were hazy hills covered with trees; there were soaring spires . The unrest was an undercurrent .  This was a time of choosing of sides , and of buildup , while there was a sense of helpless slipping onward toward what few could truly want . Voices with another , harsher message were raised . Tom Granger was hardly alone there , either . Tracts were passed out as part of their method: What Is Our Heritage ?; The Right to Be Human; Technology Versus Wisdom . Perhaps directly out of such a mixture of truth and crude thinking the assassinations began . There were thousands in scattered places .  One day Ed Dukas pushed into a knot of curious onlookers and saw the body of one of the first of these . There , in the same park where Ed had first met Abel Freeman , it had been found in the early morning . A Midas Touch blast had torn it in half .  Its Howard Besser , a machinist who lives in the same building with me , a man in the crowd offered . He died once in the lunar explosion . Now it happened again . Thats no joke , even though he can be brought back .  Ed saw the victims torn flesh . It looked like flesh . But broken bones had little metallic glints in them . Could you avoid remembering that , mated to like , these beings of vitaplasm could even reproduce their kind , to help increase their number ? Had persons like Tom Granger planned even this dramatization of a difference ? Bits of this flesh still squirmed , hours after violence .  Granger had made progress . Growing public attention had won him the privilege of orating on the newscast . It was he who had first talked about vampires and androids--together , and to a world-wide audience . He also accomplished an important part in winning the legal suppression of labs creating human forms in vitaplasm .  It was desecration , he declared in his speech . It is a tragedy that we could not clamp down the lid sooner . There are an estimated seventy million of these improvements on nature now in existence . And there are many hidden establishments still producing more . Can we ever destroy them all ? It is criminal to lock a human soul in such substance . If , of course , the soul truly remains human , as it was meant to be . . . .  Grangers voice was always gentle . Yet to his listeners it suggested dark , lonesome places where there is danger . Which was true . For now other killings had started . Familiar human blood was spilled .  On a pavement Ed saw a grim legend smeared in red beside a corpse: WHO WILL INHERIT THE UNIVERSE ? RETRIBUTION . ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER .  Scattered throughout the Americas , Europe and the Westernized Orient were millions more of such murders . The result was a trading of grim goods , with the far hardier android winning in the tally . And that winning was a threat . It could seem a promise to man of the end of his era . So here was another spur to hysteria , always mounting higher .  Ed Dukas and his friends stayed on at the University . They studied with the efficient help of the sensipsych machine and its vividly real visions , which could demonstrate as real experiences almost any skill , from the playing of an antique Viennese zither to the probing of the inner structure of a star . They also put in scattered hours of work in the factories , whose products still aimed at empire in the spatial distance . But above all they kept on with their appeals for reason . Their success was great . In the main , people were reasonable and clearheaded . But a total winning-over was far from possible .  Noted men such as Schaeffer were shouting on the newscast . Shouting for calm--increasing the tinny babble of the choosing of sides .  More and more , Ed Dukas began to lose faith in the Big Future .  Maybe we should have kept still , he said to Les Payten and Barbara Day . We only added our small faggot to the fire .  His friends laughed with him--ruefully--as they walked together across the campus .  Some minutes later Les Payten nodded to them , and , with a half smile , said , So long for now . Dont lose any sleep--not over worries , anyhow .  He sauntered off . In matters of love , Les was a good loser .  Barbara Day had taken a little apartment on a tree-lined street . It was nice to walk there in the twilight . Not far from the apartment a half-acre of ground had been allowed to grow wild with trees and bushes , for contrast to the surrounding sleek neatness .  There , in the thick shadows , Ed Dukas saw sinuous movement . He had a fleeting glimpse of something long and winding , and perhaps half as thick as his body . Then he saw it again--saw its weird glow , saw the interlocking hexagonal plates that covered it everywhere . But it did not suggest a gigantic snake at all . For one thing , its mode of locomotion was different--a rippling movement of thousands of little prongs on its undersides seemed to be involved in its principle . It hurried quietly now for cover . Rhododendron bushes parted . It disappeared behind a great oak .  Barbara and Ed rushed forward . The grass bore no marks . Prudently , they did not venture into the dark undergrowth .  Eds skin prickled all over and felt too small for him . This is it , he said in a flat tone .  What , Ed ?  Life plotted on the engineers drawing board . Vitaplasm . The days when nature designed all animals are over , Im afraid .  What would it be for , Ed ?  How would I really know ? Want to guess ?  To create more terror maybe ? Barbara said . What else ? To go around at night--to stir people up with a horror that theyve never known before . Theyll realize its vitaplasm , the stuff of the androids too . Theyll link hatreds . Maybe its another trick--a propaganda stunt to force the fight to the finish . A stunt invented by somebody like Granger .  It seems to fit the pattern , Ed said hoarsely . Youre probably right . But this thing could have been made by the other side , too . The android side . As a means of reprisal . Ive admired them . But I dont especially trust their judgment , either .  Ed Dukas felt sick . He wondered now how much longer anything on Earth could last .  Barbara touched his arm gently . Ed , we should notify the police . For the safety of the neighborhood .  Of course . And you wont stay out here alone tonight . Youll put up at a hotel , or Ill bunk on your floor .  Barbara managed to laugh . The building is stout . My window is high . There are plenty of tenants . Im not dangerously stupid and I dont swoon . But I rather like the idea of having you close by .         *       *       *       *       *  Ed Dukas had no trouble convincing the police that he had seen something extraordinary--which was proof enough that there had been other calls , previously . Ed slept a few hours on a divan , listening , while , outside , armed men patrolled the streets and watched the backs of buildings , which were kept brilliantly illuminated . Floodlights lighted up that shaggy wood lot like day . Low , flat robot vehicles plowed through it .  Nothing was found .  But miles away , nearer the city , there were a dozen dead--all of them of the old order of life . They were crushed . Not a bone in their bodies was intact . They had been dragged from their beds while they slept .  Horror swept through the city . The monster or monsters had been seen . They were of the same substance as the androids . Therefore , this was an android attack , clear and simple--to minds blurred by fear and fury .  Scared , angry faces surrounded Ed Dukas in the streets the next morning . The coldness in him was like a stone behind his heart . He seemed to be hurled along by time , helpless to change its course . Even Barbara looked sullen and confused , though , walking beside him , she tried to sound cheerfully rational .  You know , we could all be changed over into androids . I wonder if you or I would ever want that ? I think that even you are not especially sympathetic to them , except as something new and potentially great . Damn! I wish my wits were clearer . An android is a refined machine , you might say . But to be a human being is to be a thing of soul--is that it ? A creature of tradition and pride , of sentiment .  Ed Dukas shrugged . He felt bone and brain weary .  That same day there were bloody riots in scattered localities--much worse trouble than before . It seemed like the start of an avalanche .  That afternoon another incident happened . Les Payten came to meet his friends again in their favorite restaurant . They sat chatting glumly and listening to the newscast . The androids--The Phonies , they were already being called--were slipping away to the hills , for safety and also no doubt to gather their own not inconsiderable numbers , and to entrench themselves .  Les Payten was called to the phone . He came back after a minute , saying with a puzzled expression , and almost a cynical smile , My father committed suicide . He left a note: Eternity is a joke . And Im sick of being a robot . But whats the good of being a man , either--now ? Burned himself wide open with a Midas Touch pistol . I guess the ultimate cruelty would be to bring him back .         *       *       *       *       *  That night there were three times as many crushed bodies as the night before . But there were far more deaths caused by other violent means . Two weeks passed , each day worse than the preceding . Neighbors started hurling imprecations at neighbors: Test-tube monkey! . . . Obsolete imbecile! . . .  Once there was a news report: Equipment found--a power generator of a type and output similar to that for a star ship , but obviously for another purpose: meant , it seems , to power high-energy weapons of the beam type . Is this an android or a human assembly ? The equipment was ordered dismantled . It was found in a large basement in the City .  And Tom Granger began his broadcasts again: Androids--your numbers are relatively few . You could not win against us . And we would take you back--kindly--to become people again . Most of you once were human beings . You were meant to be that . . . Grangers tone was softer; it was condescending .  Ed Dukas phoned Granger at the newscast studio . After a long wait , he managed to contact him . That Granger agreed to speak to him at all was no doubt due to Eds relationship to Mitchell Prell .  Granger , he said , Im pleading . Please , forget that you know how to say anything . No , I dont want to offend you--but its just no good . Im not guessing--Ive seen . To some you may be a great leader . To others--well--youre a lot less . So do us a favor--again , please! Go away , disappear . Take a long , silent rest in a place unknown .  Ed Dukas was desperate , grasping at straws . For a fleeting moment his hope almost convinced him that his mixture of begging and ridicule might work .  Do I know you ? Oh , yes , Dukas! Granger mocked . We should converse again when we both have the time . You still need instruction , I see . You are an incorrigible lover of fantastic novelty , Edward Dukas! Now youre frightened .  Yes , I am frightened! Ed replied , calmly now . If you werent a fool and a fanatic , you could guess that millions of androids--supermen , some call them--could not be weak .  Goodbye for the present , Dukas . Granger broke the connection .  Ed rubbed his face with his hands . He thought of the sinuous thing he had once seen , and of the killing that it--and other things not necessarily of the same shape but of the same substance--had done . Could Granger be one of those who sought to stir up more dread and fury with lab-created monsters of vitaplasm ? Should he try first to find out who was using and directing them ?  It would be slow work . So , that same afternoon , he chose another path which might lead to quicker results . He went looking for old Abel Freeman , who he guessed was of the sort to be a leader among his kind . By asking around , he located the house where Freeman was said to live . But the picturesque android had long since vacated his lodgings .  Ed gathered Les Payten and Barbara .  Freeman will be in the hills somewhere , Barbara pointed out . With others like him . What if , for a lark , we rent a helicopter , and see if we can find him ? What can we lose ?  Were near the end of our rope , Les said . Im willing to try anything .  It was a crazy stunt , but they agreed on it . Ed had picked up some information about where Freeman might be found , plus a few facts of his recent history . Naturally , Freeman had a bad reputation .  Arriving over the wooded mountain country where Freeman had often been seen in the past , Ed let his craft settle into various forest glades , one after another . At first they saw no one , although certainly many androids had now retreated into this wilderness .  However , after they had made a dozen tries in as many places , Freeman himself suddenly appeared , dirty , covered with burrs , but dressed now in coveralls of modern vintage . A Midas Touch pistol was in his belt .  Hello! he greeted . Yes , I know you three young ones! Are you lost ?  Were here for neighborly conversation , Ed began .  Thats mighty nice , Freeman mocked with a twinkle in his hard blue eyes . Could be youre here just to snoop . Could be me and the boys should do you in .  Could be we are here to snoop--to learn a little better whats going on , that is , Ed replied . And were also here in the hope of finding somebody with good sense and wits and influence enough to keep this planet from becoming another Asteroid Belt .  Abel Freemans glance held a certain sparkle of admiration when he glanced at Ed; then it turned grim .  You couldnt mean me , he said . Figured on going around , minding my own business , without being crowded . Got crowded plenty , though , closer to the City . Gettin crowded here , too . Had to smash up quite a few people . Dont figure on taking it for good . Lucky we were made cheap . Couldnt stand it , otherwise . Hiding in the brush . Eating sticks . Hardly ever sleeping . Lucky we cant catch pneumonia . We could stand conditions far worse than this--but it gets awful tiresome . Seen Granger lately ?  You can smell him most everywhere , Ed answered bitterly .  There was a loud explosion a hundred yards to the left . A Midas Touch blast . Ed felt the shock-pressure of it and held his breath until the radiation-tainted vapors cooled and blew away .  Thats Nat , the hellcat of my boys , Abel Freeman remarked casually . Then he shouted , Nat--you damnfool--dont you know theres company ?  Then Ed and his companions saw them--a beetle-browed foursome peering from the brush . The Freeman boys . They looked like a quartet of Neanderthals . But in a way they were less human than Neanderthal men . For they were the crystallization , via science and vitaplasm , of someones romanticized and comic conception of the vigor of his ancestors .  Behind them now appeared a girl with pale golden skin and eyes whose slant suggested the beauty of a leopard . This would be Freemans daughter , the inestimable Nancy . There was also a leathery crone , mother of the pack , and wife of Abel .  Nat Freeman fired the Midas Touch again . Obviously he wasnt trying for accuracy . In fact , he must have miscalculated some . For the wind blew the radioactive vapors against Les Payten , standing a little to one side . He screamed once , writhing in their hot clutch , and collapsed .  Abel Freeman , the android renegade , rushed unharmed through those vapors . Only his clothes charred . Nat , you stop playin! he ordered . And as for you three young ones--you havent got the sense you talk about! Coming here ? Youre enemies . And youre weak as daisies! No , I dont figure Id ever want to be your kind , even without the raw deal I got! Lots better to be a devil in the woods until we can come out--if theres anything left to come out of , or to! Now get out of here fast--before my family gets annoyed .  Abel Freeman lifted Les Paytens hideously burned body into the helicopter and then held the door open for Ed and Barbara . You better take care of this fellow right away , Freeman said . Now get on your way!  Ed guided the craft toward the City , where Les would certainly spend several weeks in a lab tank before his injured flesh was back to normal . Les kept muttering in semi-delirium , Damned robots . Freeman , too . And damned , ornery people . Got to pick between them , dont we ? So maybe zero will cancel zero . Cant stay on the fence all the time . Sorry , when the going gets rough , Im for the people . Peaceful common sense ? There just isnt any .  Less voice sounded like a dirge for two races .  Barbara said , Maybe hes right . There isnt any sense left . Only a picking of sides for battle . Our efforts went to waste .  She sounded remote , almost unfriendly . Ed suddenly felt that he was losing her , too .     IV   That was a bad evening for Ed Dukas . He left Barbara at her house , which was now guarded . But he did not get home easily . For that was the evening trouble became general . John Jones of old-time flesh and blood , and George Smith of vitaplasm forgot all their politeness and let their smoldering thoughts come to the surface:  So now you brew up monsters like yourselves , to attack us . I wouldnt be like you if it was the last way to be alive .  Oh , no , brother ? Those creatures must be yours . What makes you so good ? Born with your own hide , eh ? The elite . With jelly for insides , and a mean nature .  Talk swiftly led to flying fists . But who could hurt an android with a human fist ? Before their hardened knuckles a human jaw could become mush . Still , there were heavier primitive weapons . Then , by progression , weapons that were not so primitive .  Ed didnt try any more to quell the trouble . He watched it , walked around it and away from it . The wise and careful thinking that he had been taught to believe in seemed to have deserted his kind . The stars were only a remote fancy , lost in the chaos of local emotion . Feeling beaten , Ed finally got home .  This was the evening when he told himself that anything could happen at any moment--that morning might not even come . On the newscast , he heard the report that the first star ship--to be aimed perhaps at Proxima Centauri or Sirius--was within weeks of completion out there on its asteroid . There were infinite heights to this era of his . And terrifying depths .  This was the evening when , fearing that the spoken word could no longer be heard through the din of clashing hatreds , Ed Dukas decided to write letters .  He meant to begin with a letter to Les and then write to his father , whose eyes had turned backward toward archaic simplicities . He wanted to write to Granger , asking again for calm . But he had only completed a few paragraphs to Les when that kid nickname of his appeared on a blank sheet of his paper . From nowhere:  Nipper .  Only Mitchell Prell , unheard from for ten years , had ever called him that . His uncle . A likable little man , tainted by accusations , but part of the once thrilling thoughts of the future . Mitchell Prell had belonged to the onward surging and reaching of science--and its stumbling . The lunar blowup had come as a forerunner of the first leap to the stars . And the human-and-android animosity had resulted from the mastery of the forces of life . Wonder becoming horror . White turning black . Till you hardly knew what to believe in , except that , being alive , you had to go on trying to make things right .  For an hour Ed Dukas sat in his room . Nothing more appeared on the paper which he had clamped under his microscope . Nipper . That was all . Silly name of his childhood . Often he looked around him , as though expecting someone to appear . Several times he said softly , Uncle Mitch , you must be here , someplace . . . .  There was no answer .  The muttering tumult in the streets--the shouts , the occasional rush of feet , the curses and yells--masked the arrival of Tom Granger . Ed was startled from his preoccupation to find Granger almost at his elbow . With him was a man who looked like a plain-clothes police official . In the background , grim and frightened , was Eds mother .  Eddie , she said . If you know anything , tell . Mitch just isnt worth any more trouble to us .  Tell what ? Ed demanded , rising .  About where Mitchell Prell is , Granger told him . You said things which hinted that he might be around .  Eds throat tightened . It was still a minor shock to remember that the probe beam had probably been used on this house sporadically for years . The refined radar of the probe beam could , if minutely focused , make fair pictures of distant things inside walls . But Ed didnt think that it could make the small print on a sheet of letter paper readable . But there were instruments that could pick up faint sounds from miles away--a voice , for instance--and amplify them to audibility . Ed was still sure that , over distance , his mind itself remained inviolable .  Ed felt cornered by the brute forces that always take over whenever reason is broken down by fear . Once his uncle had been a scapegoat to blame for disaster . Then , poor memories and triumphant years had half forgiven him . But now , during trouble , he was guilty again . And according to savage concepts of justice so were his relatives .  The confusion of half blaming his uncle left Ed and was replaced by stubborn loyalty . He summoned all his self-control and grinned carefully . He wondered if the fright in Grangers large eyes reflected realization at last of the angry hands , gone completely untrustworthy , that now touched the controls of modern science . Was he getting intelligent so late ? Or was he afraid of something simpler ?  Ed forced a laugh . You picked up my muttering , Granger , he accused . I wonder what you mutter about , these days ? Grant me the same privilege of nervousness under strain which you could do a lot to relieve , everywhere , as I have been begging you to see . No , I dont know where Mitchell Prell is , though I wish I did .  The plain-clothes man had moved over to the table . Now he peered into the microscope . Soon he motioned to Granger to do likewise . Ed felt the roots of his hair puckering .  What does Nipper signify to you , Dukas ? Granger asked at last , levelly .  Suppose its my pet name for you , Granger ? Ed answered . Your friend can take the paper along . The police laboratories might make something else of it . Maybe I doodle with a bum pen and absent-mindedly stick the doodle under a microscope--and right away somebody wants to make a story of it . You want to psyche me ? Ive humored that kind of whim from the police before . This time , for cussedness , Ill stand on my rights and demand that they get a court order before they meddle with my most private possession , my memory . Especially since hotheads and hysterics seem to have taken over . But wait , Granger . Im sure that sensible people are still in the majority . They havent reacted very much , yet . But they will--with matters as bad as they are now . Maybe they havent any answers to our problems , except calm and the hope of working something out . But thats a lot . We were schooled to cautious thinking , Granger , and that means something , even though you and plenty of others can lose their wits . Maybe the sensible people will finally shut you up!  Well take the paper along all right , the plain-clothes man said . And you , too . We already have the court order you mention .  Dukas , Granger said with a show of great patience , will you ever realize ? Were facing a soulless horror . We must be harsh if need be . But you should be glad to give your absolute co-operation . Its your duty . We have always felt that Prell is alive , somewhere . Twice he has been part of disaster , even if unintentionally . We must stop him before he can bring us greater , unknown dangers .  Ed eyed this thin , wily man who had managed to assume a certain unofficial power in the world . And again Ed had trouble judging him . Perhaps he was entirely insincere . Yet he had , too , the marks of the rabid crusader following obsolete themes that needed revision; following them blindly , with both a kind of courage and the crassest stupidity .  Tell me something , Granger , Ed said . Im curious . And I know I have a duty , however different from what you mean . Did you have a hand in the creation of the monsters of vitaplasm ? I mean the real monsters , not just the androids , the Phonies . The use of terror is old in war and politics . Stirring up fury , with the blame carefully implied elsewhere .  Grangers features stiffened , as if he had been insulted , or perhaps he was just acting . I would not dirty my hands with things from hell , Dukas! he snapped . Unwise as you are , you must know that! Now I think the police want to take you away .  Eds mother stood in the doorway of his room without saying a word . She looked strong , yet bitter and scared . He knew that her loyalty was with him , though her views differed somewhat from his .  His father must have been out of the house when Granger and the other man arrived , Ed thought . Did his going out on this chaotic evening mean anything special ? Wanting to be loyal , and at least half sure that the wish was returned , Ed didnt care to complete the thought .  He was concerned about his mother , yet he said , Try not to worry , Mom . Go to bed . Theyll have to guard the house . I can still insist on it . And I dont think I can be held very long , even now .  Your father will come to you as soon as he knows , Eddie , she said .  So Edward Dukas was carted off to the local bastille . A helmet was put on his head . But what was learned from him about the whereabouts of Mitchell Prell must have been both confusing and disappointing . Certainly , though , it must have intrigued the police , as did that single name on the paper , which told them nothing under the most careful scrutiny .  Bronson , the portly local police chief , introduced Ed to a man named Carter Loman , a bullishly handsome character with a mouth like a trap , a smile to match , and a gimlet scrutiny . A big wheel of some sort , Ed assumed . Was there something familiar about him ?  Youll have to spend the night here , Dukas , Loman rumbled .  Ed put out the light in his cell , but as he crept into his cot , he held a bit of paper from his coat pocket in one hand . He left his fountain pen open , on top of his clothes . For maybe an hour he lay quietly in the dark , listening to the scattered noises of the troubled night . Then he slept .  He awoke as dawn grayed the east and glanced at once at the paper in his hand , which he had kept outside the blanket . Eds heart leaped . A message had been written . Perhaps it had taken all night to toil it out at a creeping pace: Nipper--argue police--you go Port Smitty--Mars--at once .  The final e of once was already written , except that a line of it was still being extended . A little dot of wet ink was still laboring across the paper .  Ed had no microscope or pocket lens , but he risked turning on the light . He peered hard . He was not at all sure that he saw anything special . But imbedded in the dark liquid he thought for an instant that he beheld a suggestion of form--impossible or entirely fantastic . Then the tiny minuscule of ink quivered , and the hint was gone .  Ed whispered , so low that he himself could not hear , Uncle Mitch . I know that youre around--in some form . I wish I understood what youre up to .  Ed tore the message from the sheet of paper , chewed it to a pulp , and spat it on the floor . At least he was destroying concrete evidence that might provoke greater attention than his psyched memories . Of course they would psych him again--that was why they had held him , hoping that he would learn more . But he had learned very little .         *       *       *       *       *  The psyching was done . Chief Bronson and Carter Loman knew all that he knew . Now Ed offered his proposition: Suppose I got to Mars , as Mitchell Prell suggests ? I seem to be the only man to contact him . You are aware that I myself havent more than a wild glimmer of where the trail leads . But you know that Im badly worried about what a human-and-android conflict can mean , and that I want to break the danger somehow . If you want to find Prell , track me by the best means that you know .  Chief Bronson nodded , musingly .  Hmm-m--very good! Carter Loman grunted . Of course you would prefer to act alone , Dukas , because you are fond of Prell . You offer to combine forces with us only because it is the only way that you can do what you want to do at all . All right , we agree .  Tickets and passport will be arranged for immediately , Bronson said . And now there is someone here to see you .  It was Eds father , angry with him but more angry with the restraint under which his son had been put .  Damn it , Eddie , I tried to get to you last night , and they sent me away! he stormed . And what have you been up to ? Whats this nonsense about a message from Prell ? Damn , has everything gone completely crazy ? I was for this man Granger and his return to rustic simplicities; but hes gone wild , too! Isnt there any way to handle whats happening ? Phonies , and things from a witchs caldron , but grown to elephant size . And more of them all the time! Where does it stop ? . . . Well , it helps a little that lots of people went out last night breaking up fights . Even some Phonies did that , they say; but should we believe it ? Scientists were on the run everywhere , as maybe they should be for inventing so much new trouble . The Schaeffer lab is barricaded . Im glad for your sensible people , Ed , but can they hold the peace for more than a little while ? And would it do any final good if they could ?  Jack Dukas , the memory man of old-time flesh , was more like a dad to Ed again , and Ed was almost as glad for that as he was for the awakening of the forces of calm and order .  Thanks , Dad , Ed said with a cryptic meaning of his own . Its a small lessening of danger , anyway . Its a fact , though , that the situation , at the moment , is an explosive magazine which one well-placed idiot could set off . And its hard to see how there could ever be less than many . Say that our population is split three ways . Android , human and that mixed group which is trying to keep them from each others throats . Its hard to see how the latter can succeed for very long .  For a moment Ed and Jack Dukas were almost close , in spite of differences . Ed was a little reassured .  Im going out to Mars , Dad , he said . With police co-operation . Maybe to find my uncle . And--who knows ?--maybe even to find some useful answers .  Jack Dukas shrugged . More science , no doubt , he said . Well , anyway , good luck .  The brief spell of companionship was broken .  For a moment Ed was tense with the thought of precious time possibly wasted , chasing off to the Red Planet , when perhaps he should be trying to hunt down the perpetrators of offenses to a new biology--in vitaplasm . He knew that time remained still desperately short , with nuclear hell building up . But a choice had been made , and he sensed that it was the best one .  Ed and Barbara went to see Les Payten that morning . He lay in a bed , his body encased in an armor of plastic , under which fluids circulated . He had mended enough to listen and speak . Ed partly explained his intentions . About them , Les showed a mixture of a sick mans insight and weariness: I hope well see each other again , Ed . And that the world will still be around . And that you wont be changed too much--strong , weak , big or little . Because Ive got things figured out for me at last , Ed . Granger is right , as far as I am concerned . I was a romantic kid , but now Ive had enough! The stars are still farther out of reach than we realize . Got to fight the murdering Phonies and all of the vitaplasm menace , no matter what . Because there never was a menace like it--not to me . Les grinned wanly . So long , pals .  In a park , some hours later , Barbara and Ed walked in the beautiful dusk , while the arch of silvery murk that had been Luna masked a few of the first stars . Something with long webbed wings was visible in silhouette against it for an instant--another creature that never existed before . It added a chill to their low mood . Ed was thinking that he must say goodbye to Barbara , too , very soon , and to all the chaotic wonder and charm that was Earth . Earth maybe in its last days .  Barbara said , I wish I were going along , Eddie .  So do I . Babs , go out to the asteroids . Like my mother . Its safer there .  I meant my wish , Ed , Barbara protested earnestly . Of course , a girl is still sometimes rated as a nuisance that a man has to take extra pains to look after--no companion for one to concentrate on the dangers ahead . Maybe its true .  He looked at her sharply and gulped hard . But gay little bells seemed to tinkle in his head . Maybe a lot of things , he commented . But I think you , as much as anybody , know what were up against . Possible death , of course , which could be permanent . Or some fantastic loss or change of identity . How can we guess just what ? If you can take all that mystery and hardship , too--well , I wont say no . Maybe if you were Mrs . Ed Dukas we could have Bronson provide your tickets to Mars .  Her smile came out , like the sun . Youre heartlessly matter-of-fact and unromantic , Ed , she told him .  He drew her into the shadow of a tree . A couple of minutes later , when he released her , they both looked dazed--as though , crazy as life was , it still could be heaven . She was beautiful . Hed never seen anyone so beautiful .  Fifteen hours later they were aboard the Moon Dust .     V   As the ship rose on its column of fire some of the old love of distance and enigma came back to Ed . There was also a sense of adventurous escape , like that of city workers of centuries ago , when , chucking business and office routines , they had rushed to the country on weekends to regain a little of primitive nature while they scorched a steak over a smoky fire in the woods .  On the Moon Dust there were more women and children than men: refugees from danger . But would old Mars be much safer ? Didnt it now belong to the same human civilization , with its dark undercurrents ?  The Dukases were smoothly hurled across the vast trajectory to Mars . They landed at a high south-temperate latitude , not far below the farthest extent limit of the polar cap; though now , in summer , it had dwindled to a mere cake of deep hoarfrost a few hundred miles across and on high ground . Around this remnant stretched a yellow plain made up of crusting mud , swiftly drying lakes scummed with the Martian equivalent of green algae , and white patches of ancient-sea salt and alkali .  But Port Smitty itself was in a wide , shallow valley , or canal , a bit farther north . Its many airdomes , necessary to maintain an atmosphere dense enough and sufficiently oxygenated to sustain human life , loomed among vast greenhouses and thickets of tattered , dry-leaved plants . The central dome was topped by a statue of old Porter Smith , this regions first human inhabitant; he was still alive but long gone from the Mars he had loved . For he had associated himself with the building of star ships .  Port Smitty already boasted a population of half a million . And there were other cities of almost equal size . On Mars , many of the first rejuvenated had settled . And many colonists of every sort had come there since .  On the rusty bluff overlooking the city were the remains of a far older metropolis--towers , domes and strange nameless structures for which anything manlike could have no use . Fifty million years ago the Martians , like the people of the Asteroid Planet , had been wiped out in war .  Ed Dukas and his bride rode by tube train from the flame-blasted spaceport to the city . Their hotel room overlooked a courtyard lush with earthly palms and flowers . Birds twittered and flitted from branch to poppy bloom . From somewhere in the hotel came dance music .  Their room was supposed to be energy-shielded , but Ed remained cautious . He merely left his penpoint bared in his coat pocket , with the envelope of an old letter . He had already told Barbara all he knew about Uncle Mitchs message and had added some wild guesses . So now she gave her husband a smile of understanding as he hung his coat carefully on a chair . Then she came into his arms .  Later that evening , dancing , they covered their wariness carefully . They might be under observation in any of a hundred different ways: by probe beams , hidden cameras , or by individuals , android or human , whom they did not know . In spite of old loyalty , Ed Dukas was not entirely at ease with the thought of contacting Mitchell Prell . Yet , he wished to avoid being trailed so that he could act alone and separate from the dictatorial and often panic-stricken opinions of others .  On Mars there had been considerable violence , too , though there had been no gliding , sinuous things that brought nocturnal terror . But here , too , there was a mingling of android and human being , with no visible marks to distinguish the one from the other , though to many the difference was as great as that between man and werewolf .  Barbara seemed to grow sleepy in Eds arms as they danced . Ed yawned slightly . So they drifted from the room and back to their own quarters .  Ed pulled the old envelope from the pocket of the coat on the chair . As he had hoped , a message was traced waveringly on it: Go Port Karnak--then E .S .E . into desert .  Both Ed and his wife knew that Martian deserts surpassed all earthly conceptions of desolation . They looked at each other . The challenge was still in Barbaras eyes . The fact that she could carry a pack was a matter that had been settled long ago .  Now Ed risked speaking--in the lowest of audible whispers: So , instead of going to bed , as people in our position should , we start traveling--fast .  He felt the safety pouch under his belt . Personal recordings were in it: tiny cylinders , a pair for each of them . A precaution . In the vaults on Earth there should still be others . But one could not always be sure of those . Some had disappeared .  As memory of what he thought he had seen in a tiny ink drop still clutched rather frighteningly at Ed Dukass brain . It was a hint of how Mitchell Prell wrote his messages--in an utterly simple and heroic way , but with fantastic , dream-shot implications . Could it be part of android flexibility ? Well , probably his fancy had tricked him , because things couldnt be that odd . Still . . . .  Often Ed had felt bitter over the confusions created by the advance of science . But now enigmas led him on as thrillingly as ever . There had to be wonders ahead , for thinking of Mitchell Prell without thinking of new science was impossible .  Lets go , Babs , he whispered .  Casually , like ordinary guests checking out , they put two light valises into the conveyer and dropped to the main floor by elevator . The rest of their stuff they left behind . They paid their bill and took an auto cab to the central tube station . In the washrooms they changed from leisure clothes to the rough gear used in the Martian wilderness: light-weight vacuum armor and oxygen helmets equipped with air purifiers and small radios--all fitted over light trousers and shirts . The remaining contents of their discarded valises they transferred to rucksacks .  In the station they mingled with farmers , miners and homesteaders . Couples such as themselves were common on Mars; they were going out to make their fortunes .  They bought their tickets to Port Karnak . Ed and Barbara looked around them . A half-dozen men among the waiting passengers wore no oxygen helmets . True , this underground depot was pressurized , but the outer thinness and oxygen-poverty of the Martian air had to be prepared for . The absence of helmets , then , almost had to be the mark of the android . To keep its vital processes going , the versatile vigor of vitaplasm merely disintegrated a tiny bit of its atomic substance , to make up for the shortage of chemical energy .  Ed and Barbara boarded the train with the crowd . Much of this underground system of transportation had merely been converted to human beings use from that which had remained from the ancient culture of Mars . Behind the projectilelike coaches , close fitting in the tubes , air-pressure built up . Acceleration was swift . Covering the thousand-mile distance to Port Karnak took twenty minutes .  Once arrived , Ed bought the additional equipment they needed; then in a small restaurant they ate a last civilized meal . They took an auto bus out along a glassed-in , pressurized causeway and descended at the final stop , beside a few scattered greenhouses , the outermost of which provided the city with fresh , earthly vegetables .  Here the desert was at hand , utterly frigid at night , under the splinters of stars . Deimos , the farther moon , hung almost stationary in the north . Irregular in shape , it looked like a speck of broken chinaware , just big enough to make its form discernible . Probably it was a small asteroid which the gravity of Mars had captured .  The Dukases began to plod . The desert came under their boots , and the solidity of the ground gave way , gradually , to a difficult fluffiness , like that of dry flour . It was millions of square miles of dust the color of rusted iron , which , in part , it was . Dust , ground to ultimate fineness by eons of thin , swift wind . Under the dim light of the sky , colors dropped in tone to a monotonous grayness that only faintly revealed the nearest dunes , and showed plumes of soil moving on the wind like ghosts . The dust made a constant , sleepy soughing against their helmets , like an invitation to death .  Barbara pressed Eds gloved hand , as if in reassurance , and he pressed hers in return . Maybe they had eluded all pursuit or probe-beam tracking . Certainly the blowing dust itself would be an effective screen against the most refined radar device . Yet to vanish from the view of men could mean another kind of danger . It came to Ed that even when Mars had teemed with millions of its own inhabitants , perhaps no one had trod within a mile of where he and his wife were now walking .  The Dukases marched on for an hour without saying anything . But during a momentary rest Barbara gripped Eds arm , thus establishing a firm sonic channel , so that they could talk without using their helmet radios , which might betray them .  I hope were not too crazy , Ed , she said . Going out into a wilderness like this , on the basis of a couple of strange notes , and with blind faith that somehow well be guided . I hope; I hope!  Her tone was light and courageous , and he was more than ever glad .  Think of our muddled home world , and make that a prayer , Ed said . We might be doing something to help .  So they kept up their march through the night and into the weirdly beautiful dawn . The desert was rusty dun . The sky was deep , hard blue . The dunes were dust-plumed waves , in which a footprint was quickly lost . The rocks were wind-carven spires . Earth was the bluish morning star . It looked very peaceful , denying the need for haste . Its ring was a nebulous blur .  Barbara and Ed sucked water into their mouths through the tubes which led back from their helmets to the large canteens in their rucksacks . They swallowed anti-fatigue and food tablets . For a moment they even removed their oxygen helmets . There was no great harm in that; only the distention of blood vessels under swiftly lowered air pressure and an ache and ringing of eardrums , and of course the stinging dryness of the Martian cold against their cheeks . Forty-eight degrees Fahrenheit , below zero , it was just then .  No more clowning , Ed said as they replaced their helmets . We might get dazed by oxygen starvation and forget what were doing .  They kept up their march , through the morning , past the almost warm Martian noon , and on into the frosty chill that came long before sunset . They were still plodding on when it was dawn once more . In spite of anti-fatigue capsules , they were getting pretty groggy .  In his breast pouch Ed had his pen and the envelope on which the latest message from Mitchell Prell had been inked . Now , surely , there had been time enough . So he ventured to disturb the writing materials . There were more words on the envelope: True on course--keep moving .  So they continued to follow the pointer of their small gyrocompass , set to stab precisely toward east-southeast . Ed no longer questioned an odd miracle . It was simply there , and he was grateful .  An hour later Barbara glimpsed fluttering movement near by: a fleck of bright yellow . Then it was gone behind a large chip of stone . Then it appeared again . Ed saw it , too , for an instant . It fluttered , it chirped plaintively . It was an impossibility in the wastelands of Mars , or anywhere else on the Red Planet , outside of an air-conditioned cage . It was a small , earthly bird . A canary .  Barbara stared at it . Her blue eyes were bloodshot and scared . The tired droop of her cheeks deepened .  Darling , she said rather lamely . I think that fatigue is about to get the better of us .  Think again , Ed said .  I guess youre right , she answered . Even without vitaplasm , its not much of a stunt to give a guided missile or a spy-robot the form of a little bird , with television eyes . And a Midas Touch weapon , or something equally unpleasant , built into it . At the hotel in Port Smitty , it was unrecognizable among the other caged canaries . Here , though , its unmistakably identified . Which means that whoever is guiding it--the police looking for your Uncle Mitch or friends of Grangers , or whoever else--dont care any more that we know what it is . Were helpless now--they think .  A dull fury came to Ed Dukas . He might have guessed that all chances of their eluding surveillance would have been countered carefully . This birdlike mechanism must have followed them all the way from Port Smitty , keeping just out of sight .  Then a more hopeful idea hit him . But reason conquered it . No , he said aloud , gripping Barbaras shoulder so that she could hear . If the pseudo-canary was Uncle Mitchs guide for us , it would have revealed itself sooner , and the messages on paper would not have been necessary .  In a flash Ed drew his own Midas Touch and fired it at the place among the broken rocks where the canary had just vanished . At a little distance there was the usual spurt of incandescence , fringed now with red dust . But from the projecting boulders near its base , a small yellow form spurted with a faint and musical twitter of mockery . Then a heavy voice spoke--one which neither Ed nor Barbara recognized just then:  Better luck next time , robot lovers . Lead on!  Thereafter , the false canary was careful not to show itself . And Ed was left with his frustrated anger , and with other uncertain thoughts . What if the written messages had not come from Mitchell Prell at all , but from someone else with an unknown purpose ? Or , what if they were from Uncle Mitch , but had been prepared long ago and left to be presented to him , Ed Dukas , by means of some mechanical agent ? What if--well--many things .  Using his tiny portable radar unit to locate the bird drew only a blank . Perhaps the little mechanism with a radio speaker for a voice was effectively shielded against such detection , even at short range .  To attempt evasive action would be a waste of time and waning energy . There was nothing to do but go on , see what developed , and trust to luck . There was the certainty that real pursuit would come , but what shape it would take remained unknown .  As Ed and Barbara plodded on through the day , their minds became fuzzy with weariness . Once , in a kind of retreat from present harsh facts , Eds thoughts touched a vivid daydream that hed had before , of a planet of some star . He looked down at imaginary dry ground under imaginary feet and saw that each pebble under the strange , brilliant sunshine had a little hole in it . And something shaped like a cross , with four rough , brownish-gray arms that could bend in any direction , scrabbled away , flat against the soil , its equipment glinting . The thickets all around were stranger than those of Mars .  Yes , it was just a daydream , originating from within himself , like an old , half-buried hope of some distant exploration . He wondered if it could ever still have any fulfillment , or if that even mattered any more ? Perhaps , for all he knew , his wife and he were now headed for an even stranger region .  Ed shook his head to clear it . He did not want to disturb the envelope in his pouch too often . To expose the ink to the dried-out Martian air , while the writing was in progress at hour-hand speed , might spoil a vital message . But at last he chanced it . It seemed that the writer was not much troubled by the presence of the bird-thing or what it might mean .  Barbara and Ed read avidly: Base of capped granite rock before you . Lab .  Barbara nodded toward a formation which loomed a half mile ahead in the freezing cold of late afternoon . The slab , balanced crosswise on a slender pinnacle , identified it beyond doubt , though there were other similar spires around it . It cast its shadow on the sunlit dunes . Or was all of that dark , irregular patch shadow ?  Ed Dukas and his bride had not enjoyed the luxury of natural sleep for a long time . But summoning their flagging strength , they hurried forward . Ed felt that at last he was approaching the solution of ten-year-old enigmas .  The darker area at one side of the capped rock was not all shadow . But the Dukases had scant attention for the bluish masses of plushy stuff that grew in this aridity . At another time it might have been fascinating , for it was vegetation related to the android as moss is related to a man . It was a growth of vitaplasm--another of Mitchell Prells experiments . But Ed and Barbara had no chance to ponder this .  They located an eighteen-inch cleft at the rocks base . Edging into it , they found an irregular stone pivoted on steel hinges . To their touch , it closed behind them , and bolts clicked . From the outside now the outline of the door would seem merely a pattern of natural cracks in the granite pinnacle .  Atomic battery lamps lighted the passage , and there were more heavy doors , some of them of steel , for Ed and Barbara to bolt behind them . The place was like a small , secret fortress . At the bottom of a spiral stair , beyond a small airlock , was Mitchell Prells latest and perhaps last workshop .  He must have blasted it from the crust of Mars without help . It was a series of a half-dozen rooms and was no larger than a fair-sized apartment . Smallest of all was the combined sleeping room and kitchen; and there the evidence of months or perhaps years of absence was plainest . The bunk was thick with dust , and food remnants were blackened on unwashed plates . The air , of earthy density , smelled of decay and a strange pungence . The floors and walls were crusted with patches of the tough , bluish growths seen outside . It was suggestive at once of both fungus and moss but was really like neither . It had a pretty color under the lamps , which had certainly been burning for a long time .  Ed and Barbara removed their oxygen helmets and began a swift exploration of the premises . The rooms had all the marks of lone bachelor occupancy by a man too fearfully busy with his own deep pursuits to waste time on more than the barest attempts at housekeeping . Apparatus was everywhere . There were even recognizable parts of a helicopter--the one , no doubt , which had brought Prell and his equipment to this refuge .  At first they thought that he might since have fallen victim to some violence or accident . And then they found his body in a rectangular , plastic-covered tank , submerged in a cloudy , viscous fluid . It was a standard sort of vat , much used in laboratories in repairing extensive injury and restoring a destroyed body from a personal recording--either in protoplasm or vitaplasm . Near by , there were three similar vats , which , when opened , proved to contain only fluid .  Barbara and Ed looked for a long moment at Mitchell Prells forever young face . It was peaceful in death that was not quite death; for of the latter you could never be sure any longer , unless it was the death of the species .  If there were guile behind that gentle face , it did not show . If there were darkness of purpose , or stubborn unwillingness to recognize errors that he had committed in a civilization that tottered as it reached for greatness , it could not be seen . But in this refuge , one fact was plain: Mitchell Prell had gone on with his work in a super-biology .  Ed wandered over to a beautiful microscope of a standard make . Its attachments also started out from a familiar design . It was fitted with dozens of special screws and levers . When Ed , and then Barbara , peered into its eye-piece , they found that each of these screws and levers could manipulate a tiny tool , almost too small to see with the naked eye . There were minute cutters , calipers and burnishing wheels . Set up under the microscope there was even what seemed to be a tiny lathe . In fact , there was an entire machine shop on an ultra-miniature scale . And there were tiny , tonglike grasping members , intended to serve--on such a reduced scheme of things--as hands , where the human hand , working directly , would have been hopelessly mountainous .  In addition to this equipment , there were exact duplicates of the vats across the room and their attendant apparatus , except that each entire assembly was less than a half-inch long . In one vat there was a human figure much smaller than a doll , yet perfect .  Barbara laughed nervously . Even in this century of wonders , the human mind had its limitations for making swift adjustments . The laugh was a denial of what her eyes beheld .  Ed Dukass wide face looked at once avid and haggard . Beside the tiny vats there was also another microscope , complete in every detail , yet of the same relative dimensions as the little figure in the vat . But this lesser microscope was of the electron variety . It had to be . For at this reduced size light waves themselves were too coarse in texture to be effective for close-range work .  Ed turned slowly toward his young wife , whose eyes were alert and wonder-filled in spite of her weariness . He noticed the pleasant wave in her hair . He noted the charming curve of her brow , the tiny and pleasing irregularity of her nose . And what was all this attention but a clinging to an object of love when facing a strangeness so great that it scared him as he had never been scared before . Ed Dukas knew that his face must have gone gray .  Now his words came slowly and precisely: Babs , Ive told you that I watched part of Mitchell Prells first message being written . That in the moving speck of wet ink , for an instant something looked like a man the size of a mote! I thought Id imagined it . But is that what Uncle Mitch is now ? An android so small that the only way for him to write a note to a person of usual dimensions is to surround his own body with a droplet of ink and to drag himself across the paper , making the lines and loops of script ?  Barbara looked at him obliquely , doubting his seriousness .  Aw , now , Eddie-boy , take it a little bit easy , she said . Please do .  He didnt answer her . He let his unchanging expression and many seconds of silence do the answering for him . His pulses drummed in his ears .  At last he said , No , darling , I mean it . Theres no reason why an android no bigger than the smallest insects cant exist . And the signs of what Mitchell Prell did in this laboratory are plain enough .  Working at first with the larger microscope and the miniature tools and machinery under it , he duplicated a now common kind of biological apparatus in half-inch size . In its tank he caused to grow the simulacrum of himself that you can see . Aside from the difference in dimensions , that much has been both possible and fairly common practice for years . Its brain having been stamped with all phases of his memory and personality , it became him when it awoke . His own body he left inert and preserved in the large vat . But he was not finished . He had made just one step toward the degree of smallness that he wanted to reach . So he started over from scratch , constructing first another microscope and then relatively minute machinery and tools , fine beyond our sight . Under that tiny electron microscope Ill bet theres another , smaller machine shop , and a smaller tank from which a mote-sized Mitchell Prell emerged . It must all have been quite a job . Its not hard to see where those ten years went .  Barbara was silent for a long time . Finally , she said , It sounds reasonable--superficially . But still , is it possible ? Consider a brain . It can come in many sizes , from an ants to a human beings . But all are made of molecules of the same dimensions . And it has been pretty well determined that a brain must be always about as big as a human beings to be truly intelligent . Trying to cram such intelligence into a smaller lump of gray matter--composed of the familiar molecules--would be like trying to weave fine cloth out of rope . How can you get around that , Ed ?  Maybe I can guess , he said . With smaller units . How about the electron , Babs ? Far smaller than the molecule , certainly . And its been the soul of the best calculators--thought machines--for a couple of centuries . There isnt any doubt that a brain of microscopic size could function by far finer electronic patterning . No , it probably wouldnt work in natural protoplasm . But we already know the flexibility of vitaplasm: easy to redesign , capable of drawing its energy even from a nuclear source . Well , you figure it out . What have we here but other android advantages ? I think my uncle once told me that he meant to go where no one could go exactly as a human being .  All right , Eddie , she conceded . I guess Im persuaded . Proud girl , me . Ive got a smart boyfriend . And your uncle--he skips blithely from the bigness of the interstellar regions in his thoughts to the smallness of dust! And he seems , actually , to have done the latter--in person! Is that what were supposed to accept as truth ? If so , he must have been with you all the time , or at least for quite a while . On Earth , even . And he must have come out to Mars with us . He was right in your pocket , riding with the paper and pen . To write , he must have gunked himself up good with the ink inside the pen point . Ugh--what a thought! And maybe hes still in your pocket right now . He--or a tremendously shrunken equivalent of him . Does all this stack up right in your eyes , Ed ? A pallor had crept through Barbaras tan .  Pretty much so , Ed replied heavily .  So what do we do now , Ed ? Try to follow your uncles path--down ?  Eds flesh tingled . To follow Mitchell Prell down--a course more weirdly remote than traveling to the stars . He did not answer Barbara . He unzipped his pocket . He could not tell whether a minute android emerged or not . There were no further messages on the envelope .  But from a sound cone in a shadowy corner of this workshop , there suddenly came tones that a decade had not rubbed from his memory:  Nipper-hello! Or is it always Ed now ? So weve come to Mars together . And you with Barbara! Well , maybe that is an agreeable complication! Now we can talk . Here I have the right amplifying apparatus . I need help , and you always seemed the best--and enough like me . I know your doubts about science , and I dont blame you . But Im still the same--wanting to learn everything that I can , feeling that everything should work out right .  The stillness closed in again . Ed and Barbara looked at each other . Technology was full of tricks--the possibility of a thousand illusions . Could he even trust a voice , made so like Mitchell Prells used to be ? And could he trust the mind behind it ? Even if it truly was his uncles ?  Work out right! Ed growled mockingly . That sounds almost pious! If you are what you say you are , you were on Earth and have seen everything . You know then how right things have been! I was around when the Moon blew--remember ? And no scared hotheads caused that . But there are plenty of them now . And from here on Mars , Ive expected to see Earth momentarily puff up into a little nova .  There was a sigh from the sound cone . So Im to blame--at least partly--for helping to give those fools something to be furiously right or mistaken about , Mitchell Prells voice replied . Well , I was what I was , and I am what I am , Ed . Im sorry about many things that happened . But I cant erase them . Ive urged you to come here to help me try to counteract them . I dont think youll stay angry with me , Ed . Come where I am--you and Barbara . It can be done quite quickly now . I have two forms prepared . They will take the lines and personalities of anyone . Just set the dials above two of the unoccupied vats at one hundred--full energy . Lower yourselves into the fluid . Clothes , or lack of them , wont matter . Your own bodies will sink into suspended animation .  Again the voice from the sound cone faded out . Eds and Barbaras eyes met in a tense congress of thought . They were being asked to leave their natural , physical selves behind and to become beings of vitaplasm . To many , that was horror in itself , even without a radical change in size . Then there was the fear of loss of identity . To be an exact duplicate in mind and memory might not necessarily mean to be the same person . Here was a metaphysical problem elusive and hard to answer . What others of experience might have told you could never quite satisfy you . You had to learn for yourself .  Beyond all that , there was that drop , down and down into tininess , to where physical laws themselves must seem warped by the relativity of size levels , and to where nothing remained quite the same . Could ones mind even endure the difference ?  For a moment Ed felt cornered and panicky . But something eager and questioning came into him . For the first time he wished that Barbara had not come with him .  Finally he said , Ive got to go down , Babs . There just isnt any other way .  Whats sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose , Ed , she said . With us , that was settled a while ago .  He didnt protest . She was resourceful . Shed be a help , not a trouble . And he knew that love of adventure was as strong in her as in himself . So the decision was made .  Suddenly they heard a distant clink and hammering . Metal against stone . The canary had followed them to Mitchell Prells underground fortress . And of course the little mechanism had been merely a scout for some larger party farther to the rear .  Again the words came from the sound cone , but in a whisper , I was pretty sure youd be followed , Ed . But we should still have considerable time . Itll be hard for them to break into here--without destroying everything . And I think theyll want to see what Ive got .  Ed Dukas had never before considered his brilliant tireless uncle in any way impractical . But now he was sensing a certain inadequacy and felt that Mitchell Prell truly needed him . If it was Mitchell Prell , of course--if the voice itself wasnt a trick . But now Ed was at least more confident that he was not being fooled . What doubt remained had to be part of many calculated risks .  All right , Uncle Mitch , he said .  Barbara smiled at him rather wanly , but her eyes held a glint . He kissed her .  So here goes , eh , Eddie ? she said .  Be seein yuh , sweetheart , he said , taking her in his arms .     VI   Stripped of their boots and vacuum armor , they set the controls and lowered themselves into the gelatinous contents of the tanks . A warm , tingling numbness flowed into them at contact with the viscous , energized fluid . Weariness stabbed into their muscles . Their knees buckled , and they sank deeper into the gelatin .  All okay , Babs ? he asked .  Okay , Ed .  Then their faces went under that surface . Their minds numbed and were blotted out . They no longer needed to breathe .  The journey downward into a smaller , or , in a sense , a vaster region , was made without their awareness , in a single step . There was no need to pause at middle size , represented by the tiny but easily visible doll-like figure in the minute tank . Mitchell Prells labors in two size levels need not be done again , for that work was finished . The direct path was prepared . There was a flow of impulses , like that of the old-time transmission of photographs over wires . Gelatins already roughly of human form responded , swirled and moved tediously , and took sharper shape , in a still-smaller vat . And it was the same with the brains meant to harbor mind , memory and personality . They also were repeated in a finer medium , and by a different principle than their originals--but nonetheless repeated . So , in slightly more than an hour , the essences of two human beings were re-created in the dimensions of motes of dust .         *       *       *       *       *  Awareness returned gradually to Ed . At first it was like a blur of dreams , out of which came realization of a successful transformation , and of where he must be . Panic followed , but briefly . He was struggling violently in a thick , gluey substance . His entire body , even his face , was imbedded in it . He was certain that he would smother--yet the impulse to breathe was subdued .  Fighting the sticky stuff , he knew that he possessed great strength--relatively . Some of this was the android power in him . Perhaps more of it was the increased relative toughness of everything , in lesser size . An ant was relatively stronger than a man--a phenomenon of smaller dimensions . And here , even a gelatinous fluid seemed like heavy glue , its molecular chains long and tough . Water itself , not lying flat , but beading into dewdrops , would have seemed almost as sticky .  Ed Dukas , or his tiny likeness , got clear of the vat and its contents , though much of the latter still clung to him . On all fours he dragged it with him , leaving a trail of it in his wake on a rough , glassy surface . He kept spiraling around and around until he rid himself of most of the gelatin .  With avidness and wonder and dread , his mind scrambled through a moment of time to grasp the truths of his present state and to test them . Even the act of existing in the body he now inhabited was indescribably different . His mouth was almost dry inside . He still could draw air into his nostrils , but breathing became unnecessary before some source of energy that was probably nuclear . His hands and his nude body still looked slender and brown to him . And he retained memories--of people he knew , sights he had seen , and of things he had learned . Here he seemed to remain himself . Those memories were clear enough; but were they already losing a little importance , were they too gigantic to be concerned about in this place ?  That thought , again , was panic at work--a sense of separation from all that he held familiar . For the ato lamp towering over him seemed as remote as the sun . The form of the less-than-miniature electron microscope seemed a metal-sheened tower . And in his mind there was even the certainty that his present form must be of a wholly different design inside to meet different conditions . He knew that he could feel the thump of a heavier heart , circulating relatively more viscous fluids .  And something about his vision had changed . Close by , everything was slightly blurred , as if he were far-sighted . Farther off , objects became hazed , as by countless drifting , speeding dots that werent opaque but that seemed--each of them--to be surrounded by refractive rings that distorted the view of what lay beyond them . And because there were so many tiny centers of distortion constantly in motion , vision at this middle-distance never quite cleared but remained ashimmer . Were those translucent specks perhaps the auras of air molecules themselves ?  At a greater distance , clarity came again . For there the haze which was not haze at all but which consisted merely of seeing too much detail--in too coarse a grain , as under too much magnification--was lost . Light and dark , and familiar rich colors . And he saw the whole room around him almost as he used to see it , except for its limitless vastness .  For a little while Ed wondered further about his new eyes . They were responsive to familiar wave lengths of light . Those wave lengths were not too coarse--at least when reflected from farther objects . For nearer things , he was not at all sure that he could see even as well as he could by ordinary light . Was his vision , in this segment , perhaps electronic , then ? Did he see , close at hand , fringed hints of strange , beautiful hues ? Were these electronic colors ? Or were there infinitely finer natural wave lengths , far above the known spectrum , which too-massive instruments had been unable to detect ?  This question was dropped quickly , because there was too much more . Now he looked again , very briefly , out into the depths of air , full of drifting debris--jagged stones that glinted , showing a crystalline structure , twisted masses like the roots of trees , though they had the sheen of floss . All of it was dust of one kind or another . Ed could even hear the clink and rattle as bits of it collided . Everywhere there were murmurings of sound , which made a constant , elfin ringing never heard in the world he knew .  Gingerly now he crept across the rough glass surface , back toward the vat from which he had emerged and its companion . Barbara was his first concern . There she was , in the second vat , imbedded in a bead of gelatin . Already she was trying to fight free . He reached both arms into the stuff and tugged at her shoulders to help her . He lifted her out easily and helped scrape away the adhering gelatin , while he worried about how she might react to a tremendous change . To counteract the shock of it , he kept up a running flow of talk , in a voice that even seemed a little as it used to be:   . . . We made it , Babs . Down to rock bottom , you might say . I dont think that any conscious human shape could be made much smaller . Or any machine , for that matter . Remember some old stories ? Little men lost in weed jungles , fighting spiders and things ? Strange , unheard-of adventure , in those days! Maybe we can even try it sometime . Except that a spider , or even an aphid , wouldnt notice us . Were too small .  A little pink nymph with a rather determined jaw , she seemed only half to listen as she stared around with large eyes .  Later , like two savages , they were clothing themselves crudely in scraps of lint torn from what looked like a sleeping pallet . A fiber was knotted across it in a way that reminded Ed of the safety straps by which passengers of planes and space ships attached themselves to their seats during take-offs and landings . Here , Prell , the tiny android , must take his rare moments of rest . Some of the lint was far finer than spiderweb , but it was still coarse to Ed and his wife in their present state , as they wound its strands around them .  You look beautiful , darling , he said . Youre just as you were .  Barbara smiled slightly . Even here Im vain enough to respond to compliments , Eddie , she answered . Wheres Prell ?  Her voice was a thin thread in the keening murmur of sounds . And it was worried . Ed and Barbara both craved the reassuring presence of someone of experience here , where everything was changed--where minute gusts of air seemed bent on hurling you upward , so that you would float helplessly , like a mote . You stood up gingerly , meaning to try walking a step . But that mode of locomotion seemed not only unsafe here but impractical . You could be swept away , and in the vastness all around , how could one mote find another again ? Too much of what you were used to was lost already . Even the habit of walking no longer functioned properly . The air was a buoyant , resisting substance , a prickling presence of individually palpable molecular impacts , and there was little traction for ones feet . Perhaps , then , here you swam in the air .  Ed spoke at last: My uncle cant be far away . Hell come to us . Its been only a moment .  Barbara clung to him , afraid . Eddie , am I me anymore ? Can I even find old ways of talking , and old subjects to talk about ? Here ? Everything seems too different . Damn--I never could accept the idea of there being two of anyone! Us up in those other tanks--giants asleep . And yet us here! Maybe were different already--shaped by other surroundings! And remember how little we are and how helpless . Moving a couple of inches would be like walking a mile . And we came here to see if we could find a way to straighten out the giant affairs at home . Were androids now , arent we ? A special kind . But we still have the capacity for the old emotions . Damn it again , Eddie , everything around us in this place is so strange . But its beautiful , too .  He patted her shoulder and said nothing . But her thoughts paralleled his own .  Suddenly there was a rumble , like distant thunder . In a more familiar size level , it would have been a clink and a thud , coming through many yards of granite . They both recognized it . Ed even chuckled .  Whoever or whatever was following the canary machine , he said . Remember ?  Just then Mitchell Prells simulacrum appeared , a comic , bearded figure wrapped in a few strands of lint that suggested woven twigs . He swam out of the depths of atmosphere--the fall-guy of an era that had stumbled over its own achievements . And in several of those very achievements , he had taken refuge .  He alighted near Ed and Barbara and wrung their hands cordially . Then words spilled out of him excitedly: Ed . Barbara . Weve got to hurry . But first we should put our minds straight about one another . I know that back home you were on the side of responsibility and good sense . Well , so am I . There havent been many new quirks added to my viewpoint since you first knew me , Eddie . I want knowledge to blossom into all that it can give us . I think you do , too . Now tell me how you feel .  Mitchell Prell could still inspire Ed Dukas . Even here , at this opposite , smaller end of the cosmos , he imagined again his splendid towers of the future .  There were moments when I felt pretty bitter , he said , in not too friendly a fashion . But in the main Im with what you just said--all the way . I put my life on it as a pledge .  Barbara nodded solemnly .  Thanks , Prell answered , the breath that hed drawn for speech sighing out of him . Im more grateful than I can tell . You two may think that were too tiny--that our size makes us powerless . I dont believe thats true . I was on Earth as I am , you know . I went there and back--undetected--on space liners . But while on Earth I missed many opportunities to act against danger . Maybe Id been here too long , down close to the basic components of matter , studying them . And I went to Earth poorly equipped in both materials and experience . Well , I think you can see how it was . Let it go for now . Visitors are at our door . I suppose weve got to try to meet them in the manner that they deserve .  Call the shots! Ed said impatiently .  Mitchell Prell smiled rather wistfully . The main part is done , he replied . I set the small remote controls of the large vats for revival of the bodies in them--our larger selves . That was why I was delayed in getting to you here . They are colossi . They cannot hide . And they must be defended . Im sorry , they are better able to defend themselves than we are to defend them . At least they will have a better chance alive than inert . Revival takes a little time , but in a moment you will see .  Ed did not quite know what to think about this action on his uncles part--whether to agree to it or to suspect that it was somehow a mistake . Circumstances were too strange here , and he was too inexperienced . And the whole situation itself was fraught with confusion for him . Two selves , both named Edward Dukas ? It was not a new circumstance in the ideas of the times . You knew that it could be . Yet it remained a muddle of identities hard to straighten out . Barbara clung to him again , her feelings doubtless similar to his own .  Its happening , she whispered .  And it was . From their perch on the scored , glassy surface under a miniature electron microscope , they looked out past the minute tanks and the attendant cables , crystals and apparatus that had given them special being , and across the shimmering void of air , they saw those other vats , glassy , too , and tall as mountains .  It seemed then that the mountains opened , unfolded , grew taller , disgorged Atlases that stepped dripping over a cliff wall . There was no connection of mind now--these three giants were other people , for the link had been broken in the past . There was no blending of consciousness .  Now there were vibrations almost too heavy in this miniature region to be called sounds . They were more like earthquake shocks . But Ed realized that they were just the noises of normal human movement--the giants Ed , Barbara and Mitch putting on their boots , the grind of their footsteps . Meanwhile they conversed , it seemed; but their voices were only a quiver , a rattle , with a hint of worried inquiry . The giant Mitchell Prell seemed to make suggestions .  The lesser Prell must still have understood what was being said . For now he gripped a roughly made microphone and talked into it . His words were amplified to a seismic temblor as they emerged from the sound cone on the far wall; but to Ed and Barbara they were still directly audible from the speakers own lips . Youve come down to me successfully . Now we must see what will happen . Ed , if it is only the police at our gates , perhaps it would be best simply to present yourselves as citizens . You and Barbara have rights . And youve fulfilled your pledge to them . They cant harm you . Beyond this , I must apologize to you both . You have made a difficult journey to what must seem to you a frustrating blank wall--without experiencing anything very new . That is a defect of being duplicated . And there is no time now to blend into your minds the memories of the descent into smallness . Im sorry . Mitchell Sandhurst Prell--yes , you , my overgrown former identity--show them what to do . But for heavens sake , move this workshop of mine to a slightly less exposed place!  Because he was like his old self , the smaller Ed Dukas still thought as his original did . So , after all , there was that much contact . He understood the frustration that had just been mentioned , plus the confusion of not having seen the reality of another size level . This failure could even involve suspicion of his uncles purposes . But there was loyalty and belief , too . From the basis of parallel minds , the lesser Ed felt all these emotions personally .  So he moved quickly , closer to the tiny microphone , bent on giving reassurance . He shouted into it; and of course his words came out sounding somewhat mad: Ed , its me! Ed! Honestly! And that was a real Mitchell Prell speaking . Take care of yourself--and Babs--because youre me--or still part of me . And we both love Barbara--in any form . Hello , Barbara , darling .  There was no time to say any more , for now there began a steady , heavy vibration , growing gradually stronger . In a moment he guessed what it was . A huge , high-speed drill had been brought into play against granite . Very soon now these caverns would be invaded .  And more was happening . There were more seismic temblors . A colossus moved nearer , bringing its shadow; its wet clothing seemed to be woven of cables instead of thread . The face , briefly glimpsed , was a huge , pitted mask , bearded with a forest of dark and tangled trunks . A wind came with him , caused by his motion . He was that other Prell .  Hang on! his tiny android likeness yelled .  Ed of the dust-grain region drew his Barbara down . They flattened together and clutched part of the intricate but roughly made apparatus attached to the vats from which they had emerged , just as the glassy floor under them tilted , and they were almost swept away by gusts of air . Wires had been disconnected , and now the whole assembly--large microscope with the miniature machine shop , middle-sized tank and middle-sized doll figure under it , and the lesser electron microscope with its similar though reduced equipment--was being carried and hoisted .  It was set on a high shelf . And what must have been a translucent jar was placed in front of it to hide it casually . Maybe there was no time for anything else , for that rough vibration of the drill was becoming rapidly more pronounced .  They ought to put on oxygen helmets! Barbara shouted in the quaking tumult . These vaults will be unsealed! And they arent built to live in Martian air!  Maybe the three giants even heard her , through the mike and sound cone . But they would know , anyway .  From the twilight of the jars shadow , Ed could still see into the immensity of the room . The colossi were donning their heavy gear .  The vibration had become a gigantic rattle with creaking , crackling overtones , audible only to micro-ears . Ed felt almost shaken apart and dazed by it . Any instant now the drill would break through into the room . But he didnt anticipate much real trouble . It wasnt reasonable . He felt fairly sure that it was the police who had followed his larger self here . They had their duty to give protection , not harm . Their power might be warped by the fears and prejudices of the times , but not beyond reason .  He knew that there would be a jolt when the drill came through . So he scrambled over to the pallet and pulled from it a long bit of floss , thicker to him than a rope . Quickly he bent one end around his waist and knotted it , and fastened the middle of it around Barbara . The far end he passed to his uncle .  Tie on! he shouted . So we dont get separated . And hold tight to anything solid!  The break-through came , and it was not too bad . It felt like a monster ram hitting the world one sharp , stinging blow; then the spinning mountain of the super-hardened drill bit--all of a yard across , it must have been--braked quickly to stationary . There was no tumultuous outrush of air of earthly composition and pressure . The drill hole had evidently been capped .  Ed saw the colossi there in the room--the originals of himself , his wife and his uncle--grimly clad for Mars . They had taken up positions a little behind this obstacle or that , not ready to trust entirely but more or less sure . He knew how it was--particularly with his other identity . There had to be this tense moment before someone , known or unknown , spoke . They were armed . At the hip that was still his own in a way hung the Midas Touch pistol that he remembered , though it was expanded seemingly a million fold .  The outcome was different from what he could have hoped or expected . There was no voice of challenge or greeting from behind the drill . You could not see beyond the dark space around its jagged rim . There was only perhaps a small , intuitive warning before the neutrons of another Midas Touch struck , and a few of the atoms of metal and flesh and stone exploded in a narrow , sweeping curve , making a flash in which all visible details became lost and a volume of sound and quaking in a confined space that , of itself , could have killed .  The little Ed Dukas could be proud of his forerunner , for he was quick enough to have half drawn his own Midas Touch , just as the blaze of light came .  It didnt do any good . The lesser Eds android consciousness was rugged enough not to be lost , even as he and his companions , tethered like beads on a string , were sucked upward into the swirling dust of the atmosphere . So he saw how the Midas Touch , discharged from behind the drill , cut slantingly , like a sword blade , across the room , its narrow beam slicing through the three giants almost simultaneously . Then , for a moment , coherence of impression was lost in swirl and glare and tumbling motion . But when the tumult quieted slightly and he floated on choppy air currents , he saw the crumpled , mountainous forms . Mitchell Prell--colossal version--had been chopped in two at the waist . The heads and shoulders of the other two giants had ceased to be .  To Ed Dukass micro-cosmic nostrils , the smell of burned flesh remained unchanged . Nor was his capacity for horror any different . It came after that small , numb pause of doubt of what he had just seen . He heard the lesser Prell and the lesser Barbara shout from beside him . They had not been torn loose from the joining strand--luckily .  At first he thought that the attack had come from someone other than those who had trailed him . But then the drill point moved forward . From behind it stepped several men , wearing the trim vacuum armor of Interworld Security--usually honorable in the past but now sometimes made shaky and corrupt by the doubts within its own ranks and among the people about what , within the realm of human effort , was good or bad .  The group had a leader . Ed and his companions drifted idly in the air , near the mans shoulders , but his helmeted head still loomed in the sky of their present world . Old personality hints were hard to translate from such magnitudes; but the cocky briskness and triumph showed . There were rumblings and quakings of speech . Ed began to recognize repeated patterns in the rattle of it . Centuries ago , the deaf had had a way to hear--by sense of touch . And by feeling the heavy vibration , Ed knew that he was hearing syllables too heavy for his present auditory organs to detect as such:  . . . Prells lab  . . . Dukas led us . . . .  Ed could still understand only scattered scraps; but the skill was coming--now , with his body , he felt the stinging discord which must have been a harsh laugh .  Now a gust of wind from a vast swinging arm lifted the strand of floss and the three who were tied to it upward . Beyond the view window of the helmet , Ed saw the tremendous face--rolling plains and hills , pitted with pores and hair follicles , and scaled with skin , beneath which the individual living cells were easily visible , the latter mysteriously haloed around the edges with a faint luminosity . The mouth was a long , rilled valley , crescented into a hard grin . The nose was a crag . The eyes were concave lakes set in rough country and islanded with iris and pupil .  You know him , dont you , Eddie ? Barbara said .  Size did not hide the bullish quality or the gimlet stare . Rather , it emphasized an ugliness of character .  Of course , Ed answered . Carter Loman , who was with Chief Bronson and who spoke to us before we left . An unidentified official with whom we made the deal to come here . Nice guy . Feels that he can be the whole of the law out here in the remote Martian desert .  Again Loman addressed his henchmen . Ed was getting better at understanding the vibrating words: Well clear everything out for shipment back home . Ive got to study this equipment! But before we even open a door well sterilize everything with a four per cent neutron stream . Thatll kill even that damned vitaplasm! Fascinating , devilish stuff! Too bad , in a way , to erase it here--because I think I know whats still around , and Id like to see . But we cant take the risk . A snake I might give a chance , but not a robot or robot-lover!  Loman paused , then spoke again , turning his head this way and that , directing his words toward the invisible: Prell , youre dead , but are you still somehow here ? What cant happen in the crazy age you helped create ? On Earth we psyched your nephew . Dont think I didnt guess what you were doing . Now weve taken your carcass into the other room to psych your dead brain . In a few minutes well know . Therell be ways to stop your kind of folly!  As the great head continued to turn here and there questioningly , the still-living Mitchell Prell shouted in derision: Here I am , crusader!  But there were no microphone and sound-cone in action now , and Loman did not hear him .  Maybe Barbaras present eyes were too minute to shed tears , but her face looked as though she were weeping . Loman is the worst kind of fanatic , she said . Sure that hes right , and blind about it . Sadistic , energetic and , I suppose , clever .  Ill tell you more about him , Mitchell Prell offered softly . His face gives a faint glow--a fine radiation that only our eyes can see . Radioactivity . It wouldnt be visible on Earth , where oxygen gives even an android bodily energy . But on Mars--or wherever else that oxygen is in short supply--vitaplasm adapts readily to other energy sources . It would be silly for him to carry air purifiers in that helmet hes wearing .  Ed Dukas looked down at his own arms . Yes , they glowed , too , though hed hardly noticed it before in the light of the great ato lamps .  Then Loman is an android who hates androids! Barbara breathed . Well , I guess that hating ones own kind has happened often enough before . But an android in the Interworld Police ? Under physical examination , he could never hide what he is .  Legally , they still have equal rights , Ed answered . That much Im glad for . They couldnt be kept out of the Force . But there could be other twists , not so unprejudiced . A thief sent to catch a thief , would you say ? Something strong , and full of self-hatred , sent out to match strength ? Tom Granger , and thousands of others , might think like that .  Ed Dukass anger broke through at last , slow and terrible . Maybe he had been too startled before for exact meanings to register . The other Barbara , whom he loved , had been murdered , her body mangled . It was the same with his own other self , and his uncles . Those bodies had been the one available route back to all familiar things and out of this weird place of expanded forms , warped physical laws , keening sounds and distances multiplied a millionfold . But now those bodies were gone . And even if beings invisible in smallness could escape death in neutron streams from Midas Touch pistols turned low , there would be little left that they , in their tininess , could work with . They would be stranded here in a microcosmos for as long as they could survive , helpless to move even a pebble .  These thoughts were fringed with a homesickness that Ed had never before known . He wondered if a little dust-grain android could go mad . It was Carter Lomans fault . No , the responsibility extended further than that! To Tom Granger , the rabble-rouser , and those like him , and those who listened . And to a renegade android leader of mythical origin . Yes , it was Mitchell Prells fault , too , and his own for coming here and bringing Barbara .  With his two companions , Ed Dukas floated high in the air , supported by molecular impacts , near the helmeted head of an Atlas called Carter Loman , and felt his fury and the helpless contrast of dimensions . This giant , aided by his henchmen , had all of the advantage , while Ed and his wife and uncle could be blown away merely by the wind of that monster hand in motion .  Loman was throwing words at Mitchell Prell again , his voice coming easily through the thin face plate of his helmet . It was not a true sound to micro-ears . Rather , it was a heavy quiver in the air , felt with ones entire body . Prell , Im sure you havent stopped existing . Dont think that I cant understand how . And you did things to me . There was your Moonblast , but that wasnt the worst . Everything you stand for must be stamped out . Even if we all go with it .  Maybe it was then that Eds thoughts became crystalized . His anger was turned cold and clear , as if by need . Although Ed was of vitaplasm himself , he felt no loyalty to kind . In fact , he was still far from reconciled to the condition . But an enemy of reason was an enemy to all men of whatever sort .  His wits were sharpened . Suddenly a realization of the power in smallness came to him--combined with the hardiness and flexibility of flesh that made even such dimensions and powers possible . Android powers .  I guess everybody must have a breaking point of fear and exasperation , he said softly . We were born to it . To be crowded from the Earth can seem a terrible idea . But maybe even that is as it should be , and good . I cant agree that pushing everything into extinction in an open fight can be any better . Weve gained too much . There is too much wonder ahead . And maybe , small as we are , we can quiet the leaders . Under the right conditions , I think we could handle these giants--even kill them if necessary . Quieting Loman and Granger might help a little .  I know , Mitchell Prell answered . I thought of it myself . Perhaps I didnt have the nerve to carry the idea through . Maybe that was why I wanted you to come to me on Mars--where I had the apparatus to change you . Microbes are smaller than we are , yet they used to kill men .  Ed Dukas saw his wife wince . But this couldnt make any difference now .  Ed and Barbara , Im sorry for all Ive gotten you into , Prell added .  Dont be , Ed told him . Who can regret a chance to try to do some good in what seemed a hopeless conflict ? Now , first , lets get out of here , if we still can or ever could .  Ed felt some of the command switching to himself--strange , because his uncle knew far more about these regions than he did . But Mitchell Prell was made more for study than for physical action . And he was somewhat fuddled by the effects of the miracles he had helped produce .     VII   The colossi were piling Mitchell Prells movable equipment into a corner , where Midas Touch pistols , turned low , could play neutron streams against it . Then they would no doubt scour walls , floors and ceilings with the same corpuscular beams . The air itself would heat up considerably . Combustible floating dust , would burn to finer dust . Drafts would seem blasting hurricanes .  Theres a way out--if we hurry , Mitchell Prell said . Imitate my movements .  And so they swam in the atmosphere . But without other aid it would have been slow going indeed . But the motion of dust particles revealed the direction of air currents that could be gotten into and used to cover distance .  Still , progress back to the shelf and the microscopes , and the tiny workshop from which they had been blown but a few minutes before , was agonizingly slow . By luck and scanty concealment offered by the jar , this paraphernalia had not yet been discovered or moved by Loman and his men .  Ed and his companions came to rest at last on the rough glass surface where little machines were arranged around the vats and their apparatus .  Tools that we can use , Ed said . And materials that we can work . Weve got to try to take some things along . To make weapons . Could we contrive Midas Touch pistols that we could hold ?  Maybe , Prell answered . I hope so . Take this , and that--and that over there . Hurry .  Creatures of vitaplasm , with its complex combinations of silicon compounds paralleling the hydrocarbons , and its internal metabolism that could even involve transmutation and subatomic energy release , still could die under sufficiently violent conditions .  The three tiny androids scrambled to gather supplies and to equip themselves . Ed was awkward in the new conditions , where even the atmosphere tried to tear him away from any firm foothold . But he loaded himself down .  Before they were finished gathering all that they could use , the rattle and flare of Midas Touch weapons , turned low so as not to damage Mitchell Prells various apparatus , but strong enough to destroy any clinging speck of synthetic life that Carter Loman might suspect the presence of , began behind them . Prells experimental plant life withered slowly .  Lead on! Ed Dukas shouted .  And so , though hurricanes had begun for them , they crept across the glazed surface beneath the barrel of the little electron microscope and dropped into the air at its edge . It was like leaping from a cliff . But it was different , too . For if they had not been so heavily burdened , they might not even have fallen . Being such small objects , they had a greater exposed surface than large objects , in proportion to their bulk . This greater surface , like a sail presented to the wind , offered a larger area for speeding molecules to hit; hence , without the equipment , they would have been as buoyant as dust particles .  Still lashed together by their joining strand of floss , the three fugitives drifted slowly down to the rear of the shelf .  An inch more to go , Prell shouted , in grim humor . A rather long one , Im afraid .  Again they crept . Rough stone of the cupboardlike compartment rose around them , seemingly taller than buildings they had known . And it glowed reddish-violet . Fluorescence , it must be , from the scattered radiations of the Midas Touch weapons . Tediously the three crawled toward escape , as if through a night of fire and violence . Finally they reached a minute steel door in the corner of the cupboard , half hidden in the roughness of the stone .  They closed the door behind them and refastened its crude bolt . The space around them now was narrower--more in proportion to their own size . And there was a glow here--at least to their final eyesight . Perhaps there was a trace of radioactive ore in the rock causing the glow . The walls were as rough as a caves .  Just a chink in the stone , Barbara commented .  Yes , Prell replied . A crevice leading out to the face of the rock formation . Feel the draft of Martian night air ? It would smother and freeze you if you were as you were born . But our flesh not only resists cold , it can create plenty of warmth within itself . We will be perfectly comfortable here , and safe--I think . Do you want to rest ?  No , Barbara told him . We dont really need that , either , do we ? So lets begin what must be done . What are our plans , Ed ?  Well make a few things , if we can , Ed replied . Then get to a spaceport somehow . I suppose that if we pick the right wind at the right time , it will blow us there--eh , Uncle Mitch ? Then well do as you did--drift into a space liner and get a free ride back home to Earth . There--well , well see . If were very , very lucky , we might even get our old selves back .  Just then that recovery seemed to be his greatest , most desperate yearning , with many , many obstacles in its way . Even their personal recordings were in enemy hands now . Small though those cylinders were , they were far too huge for them to move or to think of recapturing .  Where can we start to work ? Ed said to his uncle .  Farther along the cleft , Prell told him . Ive already cached some supplies there . And theres a level space in a side cleft protected from these constant air currents .  Now they leaped upward and let the draft carry them . The muted quivers of destruction in the chambers from which they had just escaped , they left behind them . They arrived in the work area and got busy at once .         *       *       *       *       *  Near dawn they felt the quiverings of unusual sounds . So they followed air currents , betrayed by drifting particles of fluorescent dust , to a crack that showed starshot sky and the undulating desert . Thus they saw Carter Lomans caravan start back toward Port Karnak , with its booty of all that Mitchell Prell had made here: the fruit of a mans mind . But to Loman it was also the worst of the worlds inventions . Loman was an android and also , obviously , a central figure , a personage of some importance , or he would not have been sent on this mission . But his mind remained that of a bigot .  Just then Ed Dukas found a savage pleasure in shaking one of the smallest fists ever to exist at the three retreating tractor vehicles . Loman , Granger and the rest of you , he said , therell come a time . Youve been fools . You were born too late .  The work went on for days--more tediously than Ed could have imagined , even with only hand tools to use . The same old metals seemed unbelievably hard at this size level--and coarse in texture--as if the atoms themselves had expanded . Barbara could scrub and scrub with a bit of abrasive mineral , achieving only what seemed a poor excuse for a polish . Hammering did little good in shaping such metals , though Ed Dukas and Mitchell Prell were relatively so much stronger than they had been . Only cutting and pressure tools were effective , when aided by the softening heat of a forge--a tiny speck of nuclear incandescence maintained by a neutron stream and carefully screened , though vitaplasm , being actively or latently radioactive itself , was far less endangered by radiation than protoplasm .  But at last they produced three rough , cylindrical devices and their fittings .  Ed Dukas began to adjust to littleness . But to see boulders with their stratified layers of mica floating lazily through the thin air never lost its wonder . Crazy beauty was all around: strange , rich colors; keening musical notes--fine overtones of normal sounds . Sometimes , in the daylight , near cracks open to the outdoors , you saw living things seldom bigger than yourself: Martian life; little pincushions of deep , translucent purple veined with red and pronged with cilia of an indescribably warm hue . These were Martian microorganisms blown in by the breeze .  And once there was something else that Ed and Barbara both saw: something like the smallest of Earthly insects , but not that , either . A thing of steel-blue filaments and great eyes , and vibrating vanes as glossy as transparent plastic . Ed knew that he could shatter it with his hands . It rested in the sunshine for a moment; then it was gone .  I suppose that there are star worlds as odd as this , Barbara commented .  She was strange herself--an elfin being that floated in the air , her form dimly aglow whenever there was shadow or darkness . To Ed , she was part of his vast separation from Earth . In accustoming himself to an environment where even the simple act of walking was a memory , it seemed that Earth dimmed away , easily yet frighteningly , like a dream , until Ed knew that , degree by degree , his mind was becoming different than it had been , and he not quite the same person . And it seemed more so with Babs .  Bacon and eggs for breakfast , Eddie , she teased once , lightly . Walks under old trees beside a river . The Youth Center . Teachers I used to know . Yes , I remember . But the memory tries to get dim . And I want to hold on . Got to , because there are things to be done . But sometimes I wonder if I shouldnt regret the duty . I think of swimming in raindrops or floating high over trees--being as whimsical as children and poets can imagine . We could do it! Its part of being super , isnt it ? And I used to be scared of becoming an android!  It was fun , and relief from grimness , to hear her talk like that . And now , too , he half agreed that being of synthetic substance was not so bad . Yet part of him still ached savagely for his old dimensions . And here in smallness he sometimes felt that she was changing so much that he was losing her--that she would let herself be blown away into the vastness , never to be seen again .  They ate a food-jelly , which Prell had prepared long ago for his sojourn here , and radioactive silicates . In it you could see the thready molecular chains and the beads of moisture between . Viscosity complicated etiquette . Everything tried to stick to you . You laughed and shook it off as best you could .  But even in fantastic moments grim facts didnt truly fade . Hard work helped sustain them . Murder and loss were too new . The danger on Earth was still too plain--perhaps poised on hours or weeks of time . Speed was the keynote .  Only once the three micro-beings peeped back into the lab that had belonged to Mitchell Prell , colossus . It was empty now , glowing with the taint of radiation left by the Midas Touch pistols . No one had troubled to neutralize it , as had surely been done with the removed equipment .  Mitchell Prell had built a radio , like one he had owned before . A flake of quartz dust , a few rough strands of metal , an insignificant power supply . Simple , compact . Certain crystals were sensitive to radio waves . And at these tremendously reduced dimensions , they could convert tiny induced electric currents almost directly into fine sound waves that infinitely refined ears could hear .  So Ed Dukas heard the interplanetary newscast again:  . . . Android groups are still massing in large numbers to seek safety among their own kind and perhaps to carry out their own plans . There is a superficial calm . Fear of consequences so far seems to have kept both sides in check . We hope that it can hold .  Later there was a broadcast from Port Smitty:  . . . This information was withheld but has now been released . The mystery of Mitchell Prells disappearance is believed solved after ten years . What is claimed to be his body--much damaged , since he and his confederates , one of whom is supposed to be a close relative , resisted capture and had to be shot down--was brought in to Port Smitty and is now en route to Earth , along with some mysterious equipment . The man who tracked Prell down is Carter Loman , a scientist in his own right , who has had a brief but brilliant career in Interworld Security . Detailed information is under seal , but Prell , a known advocate of improved mankind , has been wanted for questioning and possible indictment for a long time . It has been suggested that his researches had gone further than most would dare to imagine .  Mitchell Prell , micro-being , chuckled . The funny part , he remarked , is that I never became a full-size android myself . My old carcass seemed good enough . Or I didnt get around to a change .  But Ed didnt smile at this . And he looked savage when one of Tom Grangers speeches was rebroadcast: Prell ended ? Can we believe it ? There is an evil that could restore him in known ways . Now are there unknowns , too ? Havent we had enough ? Some things from drunken visions are destroyed , but others come , to make our nights hideous . A creature with a fifty-foot wingspread swoops down on a house , and people die . Are androids any different from what they create ? But we are fortified , armed . If we must , well fight to the last .  No doubt there was truth behind the melodramatic oratory--at least as far as the horror was concerned . Barbara smiled sadly .  Hes earnest , I think , she offered . So theres that much glory and courage in him , if there isnt any control . And you keep wondering , Is he half right ?  I know , Ed answered with some contrition . But Id rather have what he considers a scientific hell than nothing . Well , well soon be en route back to Earth--unseen . Then maybe well find out and accomplish something . Lack of sense , like Grangers , or the muddled way in which laws are often interpreted now , will never work . Thats one fact Im sure of , even in a booby-trapped situation .  Ed was trying to be optimistic . In three weeks they had made equipment that they thought they could use . The three cylinders were Midas Touch pistols--neutron blast guns that could explode a few of the atoms of any solid or liquid that their beams touched . They also had a dozen grenades of the same principle and tubes to carry scant rations . There was a radio for each of the three--for reception , but also limitedly useful as transmitters . And there were knapsacks and clothing made from linten fiber pounded and divided as Prell had never bothered to do .  Well catch the first Earth-bound ship that we can , Prell said . Queer , isnt it ? If we could truly walk , going a mile would seem impossible . But the prevailing winds and a little jockeying will get us to Port Karnak . The tube train will take us to the space ships .  Prell had spoken too soon . Within that same hour , listening to the newscast , they learned: For security reasons , interplanetary traffic has been indefinitely suspended .  Ed Dukas winced as if in pain . He and Barbara and Prell looked at one another . In Eds strange , small body , frustration and bitter anger fairly hummed .  Security reasons . That could be a blanket excuse--minus explanations--for almost anything . Loman , knowing of something inimical and microscopic , and guessing at an intended journey from Mars , could well have had a hand in the suspension order . He was wary , and not sure that he had destroyed his hidden enemies .  The three stared down at the equipment that they had toiled so hard to produce . But Ed , like many another man before him who had been cornered , couldnt have quit even if he had willed it . Stubborn spunk , fear , need to regain losses , self-preservation and the awareness of the danger of millions of well-intentioned individuals , both android and human , all took part in the reason . And you could add the ancient and primal lust for revenge .  Ed crouched with the others on the rough floor of their chink in the rock . Wait , he said at last . Havent small objects crossed space naturally--at least in hypothesis ? Yes! Spores--living dust , their vital functions suspended . The old Arrhenius Theory of the propagation of life from world to world and solar system to solar system--throughout the universe . A spore , drifting high in an atmosphere , achieves escape velocity through molecular impacts and perhaps the pressure of solar light . Its driven into space , and onward . Uncle Mitch , couldnt the same thing happen to us far more readily , since were not inert and we have minds to help direct our movements ? Since we have beams of massive neutrons from the Midas Touch weapons ? And arent we more rugged than the first androids ? Wouldnt we have a middling chance to endure raw space itself ?  Mitchell Prell eyed him quietly . Perhaps even his android cheeks blanched a trifle . Something like that occurred to me once--a long time ago , Ed , he remarked at last , his voice very calm . I didnt think it through . I guess it seemed just too out of the ordinary even for me . And there wasnt any need to try it . Perhaps I was scared .  Theres need now , Ed said .  Barbaras expression was a study of eagerness and half fear . Eddie , have you maybe discovered something ? she exclaimed . Uncle Mitch , if there is any chance that it would work , Im game to try it!  After a moment the scientist nodded . I believe that theres a good chance it will work , he said .         *       *       *       *       *  Before the next sunup they were ready . Clothed in garments of linten fiber , they looked like savages from fifty thousand years before . Yet their present condition could have belonged to no primitive era . They were united by a tough line of twisted strands , and their equipment was lashed to their backs . To human eyes they would have been as invisible as spirits . Were they to demonstrate , even unintentionally , android superiority in yet another field ? Maybe , maybe not .  From the outlet of the crevice in the rock , they flung themselves into the atmosphere above the gray desert . Their great advantage at this stage was that , at the Martian dawn fringe , there were many updrafts , for the air , chilled fearfully at night , was already warming . At once they were sucked upward , as if by a vertical wind . Still , the first phase of their climb took many hours . They kept watching for upward-moving motes to guide them . Short , rocketlike bursts of heavy neutrons from their Midas Touch cylinders provided the reaction or kick to get them into the swiftest vertical currents .  Mars dropped far below , a dun plain marked here and there by the straight , artificial valleys or canals . The relative vastness of a world to beings of pinpoint dimensions was nullified by the distance of altitude , until it looked no more extensive than it would have to the eyes that used to be theirs . Mars developed a visible curvature and a rim of haze , fired to redness by the rising sun . The sky above darkened from hard , deep blue toward the blackness of space , and the stars sharpened . The sun blazed whitely , and the frosty wings of its corona began to show . The thinning atmosphere seemed to develop a definite surface far beneath the three voyagers .  They had spoken little in their ascent; but now the free movement of sound was smothered by the increasing vacuum , and there were only gestures and lip movements to convey meanings .  But there was not much that really needed to be said . The plan remained simple: get into trains of upward-jetting molecules , marked by small blurs or warpings of light . Absorb some of that upward surge into yourselves . How often had this same thing happened , without conscious design ? Molecules move fast in a high vacuum . Molecular velocity was heat , wasnt it ? But here it could not burn . For heat is chained to matter , and here there was just not enough matter to be hot .  Ed thought that they must be getting close to the Martian velocity of escape now . Only three-point-two miles per second . They might have attained it more simply by making greater use of their Midas Touch cylinders . There was scarcely any reactive thrust more efficient than that of neutrons hurled at almost the speed of light . But there was a pride in accomplishing it in a more difficult way . Besides , the energy supply for the weapons must be conserved .  But now Prell signaled with his hand , and they began to use the cylinders in earnest , shifting their course little by little from the vertical and in the direction of the sun . For it was time to curve inward--earthward . Swiftly now , there was no molecular distortion around them at all . Sense of motion faded out . Their high velocity was demonstrated only by the rapid shrinking of Mars behind them; unless , from sunward there came a minute , resisting thrust . Light pressure ? But it would take a longer time in space than they meant to be to slow them down at all .  Weve done this much! Ed said with his lips , but without a voice .  Barbara nodded and tried to smile , and he reached out and pressed her hand . Prell looked awed and bemused .  Ed tried then to read part of their fortunes in the reactions of his strange , minute body to the rigors of space . It was an atomic mechanism more than it was a chemical one . Therefore , it needed no breath . And the strong , radiant energy of the sun warmed it a little , so he did not feel cold . Hard ultraviolet light seemed not to harm it . There was only a sensation as of the shrinking of its hide--perhaps an adaptive reaction of its demoniac vitality--to protect the trace of moisture within it against the dryness of space . The fluid within vitaplasm could be alcohol or liquid air--it was that adaptable . Prell had said this recently . Such fluids did not freeze easily . But they evaporated . So water remained the best body fluid in dry space . For in the full light of the sun , and with a nuclear metabolism , freezing was not a great danger .         *       *       *       *       *  Several days out from Mars the three contacted a small meteor swarm--maybe a fragment of a comet moving sunward and earthward . They moved with the swarm and landed on a chunk of whitish rock perhaps eight inches through at its largest diameter . But to them it was an airless world into which they could burrow , blocking the entrance to their shelter with chalky dust--a fortunate thing , for in the open the suns glare and aridity of space were drying out even their android tissues and blurring their minds .  The meteor proved not quite lifeless , for on it clear crystalline needles crumbled and rose again . Call it silicon biology , proving that one could never know where something might thrive . In a fall into any atmosphere , such growth would surely be burned away without a trace .  Ed and Barbara and Prell learned to understand silent speech by watching lip movements . The need for hurry still beat in their minds , but drowsiness crept over them--perhaps another androidal adaptability was functioning here , related to the hibernation of animals in winter . It lessened loss of vitality when conditions were not too favorable . But you could resist its compulsions if you applied your will .  The meteor moved on swiftly in the general direction of Earth . The journey would take weeks , and though Ed felt that never had there been a crossing of distance as eerily strange as this one , still the passage of time , and the events it held , was always with him and his companions .  There was a way for them still to experience real sounds , even here . The quartz-flake radio sets , pressed tight to their ears , transmitted vibrations through their own substance , when there was no air . They heard fragments of broadcasts coming from Earth . Pictures of what was happening there came to mind:  A score of monsters destroyed by hunting parties . A side issue , really . For in guard post and sketchily fortified line , man faced the hardier likeness that his knowledge had produced . When there were no clearly defined geographical boundaries to separate the poised forces , you never knew just where those lines would be .  But the scared , the pleading , the exhorting voices , faint in the distance , gave the mood , if not the clear view . Tom Granger was there , and others like him . The latest claim was that vitaplasm gave off poisonous radioactive radiations--not very true on Earth , where its vital energy remained mainly chemical .  Those with sense also tried to be heard . And there were other voices calling for the retreat to simplicity and the doing of work by hand . Such a pastoral of white clouds , green hills and sunshine could have its appeal . But how could its philosophy and inefficiency feed billions ? Even if it were not just a bright vision seen before the last battle ?  And in the midst of all this babble , there was another voice that was faint thunder:  . . . Got things of our own now , here in the woods! Even our own newscast station . Damn , weve taken enough! We Phonies wont go back no further! Time to be stubborn--even if we all die for it and never come back! They say folks would like to hang me--which shows how much wits theyve got! Even if they got the chance , it wouldnt work!  With a faint smile , Barbaras lips formed the name for her companions to read: Abel Freeman . . . .  Ed nodded , watching his uncles quizzical interest over an individual and a legend that he had only heard them tell about . And Ed had his own reactions , compounded of admiration , humor and icy mistrust that came close to hatred . Whatever else he was , Abel Freeman was also a figure of power .  Barbaras pixyish mouth--she was more than ever a pixy--shaped other words as they crouched at the entrance of a tiny cave that they had excavated into their meteor . Outside , the sunshine blazed .  Ive almost said it before , Ed , she remarked . All these things happening on Earth are still important to me--never fear . But Im a little too different now to quite belong to it . It gets like a dream--kind of remote .  Ed had been feeling this himself--almost with panic , because he was enough the person he had been to ache inside with the importance and tension of what happened at home . Yet somehow part of him was drifting away on its own special course .  Hold on , Babs , a little longer , he urged .  They fell into torpid sleep after they had devised a mechanism to arouse them with an electric shock at an appointed time . It conserved their strength and allowed them to pass the long interval quickly .  Ed Dukass slumber was not altogether dreamless . Like shadows , people moved in his mind . His parents . His old friend Les Payten , who perhaps had shown the white feather and had been lost to a small viewpoint . Schaeffer , one of the greatest scientists , barricaded in his underground lab in the City . And Harwell , the efficient but daring adventurer--another legend of his boyhood , who sometime was supposed to command the first star ship . And perhaps most of all , there was that fantastic android bigot , Carter Loman , who aroused his black fury .  Perhaps Ed slept lighter than the others and awoke more quickly to the tingling prickle of electricity , because he had to run the show . The major burden of responsibility was his .  He shook his wife and his uncle awake and pointed to the blue-green bead that was the Earth , still several million miles away . Lashing their equipment to their shoulders and tying onto one anothers waists like Alpine climbers , they leapt back into space one more , pushed by the neutron thrust of their Midas Touch cylinders . They had to make the rest of their trip apart from their meteor , which would not pass any nearer to Earth .  When the home planet was expanded by nearness to a great , mottled , fuzzy bubble , Ed tugged at the line for attention and spoke without sound in the stinging silence: Weve talked everything over before , he said . So we know generally what to do--though only generally . Wed like to stick together . But there is just no way to do that and work fast--which may be a vital point . So well soon have to scatter . But well listen on our receivers . At least one of us should be able to find a way to communicate back . Failing that , we still know where to meet . Remember--the oak by my old house . The valley made by the trunk and the lowest branch .  Prells brows knitted , his mind probably steeped in the swift , strange action to come . Barbara gave a soundless laugh .  The crotch of an oak! her lips commented . What a trysting place! But it seems natural enough . Are we mad , or were we once just dull ?  Was her gaiety just bravado , or was she as cool as she seemed ? Ed hoped that she was cool . Tugging at the linten line that joined them , Ed drew himself close to her .  You dont have to speak , Eddie , she told him . I know what youre thinking . But why shouldnt I--and all of us--be all right ?  Her face had sobered . She looked strong . And so he was somewhat relieved . He kissed her . Perhaps it was odd that dust-mote beings still could do that .     VIII   Ed and Barbara and Prell came to the parting of the ways sooner than they had intended . Without instruments , it was hard to judge velocity . They did not use their Midas Touch cylinders quite long enough to check speed sufficiently as they approached the great blue-green planet with its blurred ring . They hit the atmosphere , not really fast , but fast enough . Briefly , sound was reborn around them in a shrieking whistle , like a vast , thin wind . They tumbled over and over , and the strand that kept them together was broken . Tumultuous currents of the high ionosphere separated and scattered them as they plummeted lower .  Ed was unhurt . And did he hear--more in his imagination than his ears , here in the muffling semi-vacuum--a distant laugh and shout: Its all right , Eddie  . . . ? The impression faded away , like the voice of some gay sprite vanishing . Hed thought before of losing Barbara . Now they were two specks , separated from each other in the infinity of the terrestrial atmosphere . Even with the logic of plan and method , there was still some unbelief about how they would ever find each other again .  Using his radio , he tried to call . But there was no answer . The microscopic instrument could pick up messages from powerful stations millions of miles away . But for transmission , its range and that of those like it had to be ridiculously short: perhaps a score of yards--a fair distance in proportionate units .  Ed was drifting now , alone and high , as his wife and uncle must be , too . Well , theyd meant this to happen soon anyway . So there was no real difference , was there ? Get down to work quickly , down to the surface , where the high clouds seemed to lie flat on the gray Atlantic and on the nearby greenery of the continent . Eds cylinder flamed , forcing him lower toward the City . His first chosen task was to find Carter Loman , a key enemy . Prells objective was Tom Granger; then he would try to contact the androids , perhaps through Abel Freeman . And Barbara was to try to spike the trigger of violence by whatever means she could . That , in fact , was the greatest purpose of them all .  Downdrafts aided Eds descent , while he listened to his quartz-chip radio . Was one who figured as prominently as Loman in the strained news of the day ever difficult to find ? Ed did not anticipate too much trouble in locating him . Many people would know where Loman was and mention of the place would be frequent . Crowds would follow him everywhere .  As Ed watched a wolfish patrol of armed spacecraft , flying low on their atmospheric foils , the information came easily enough:  . . . Carter Lomans quarters at the Three Worlds Hotel are constantly under guard .  Ed was far more proficient now in getting around swiftly in the region of smallness . Erratically but effectively , using currents of air and the thrust of his Midas Touch blast , he descended toward a sky-piercing tower . He drifted into the doorway of the hotels sumptuous lobby , marred now by the grim additions of radiation shields . For a few minutes Ed perched on the reception desk; he was less noticeable there than a fleck of cigarette ash .  There were constant inquiries for Loman , by telephone and in person , made mostly by newscast men . The clerks fended them off briskly . But soon there came whispered thunder , so low that it was almost audible to Ed as sound and not merely sensible as a heavy vibration: More mail for Mr . Loman . . . .  The spark of Eds propelling cylinder was almost too small to see as he jetted to the heavy bundle of letters and rode up with the attendant , past the guards , and slid with a skittering envelope through a mail slot , and into Carter Lomans presence .  He was sprawled on a bed and was clad in full vacuum armor of a type heavier than would have been necessary even on a dead world . It was pronged with special details as well: filaments , like parts of the insides of a Midas Touch weapon . Hovering over the vast shape , Ed felt the hard , stinging punch of a few scattered neutrons hitting his body before he ventured too close . Even though his own life was subatomic in principle , enough of those infinitesimal pellets could kill him . Loman had evidently grown wary and nervous , guessing with shrewd imagination what dangers he might now face . In addition to his massive costume , this android who hated his kind was wearing an aura of low-speed neutrons , constantly being projected from the filaments on his armor . Just then , the savagery inside Ed felt its bitter frustration . Loman even mistrusted the ban on space travel .  The enormous face beneath him , framed beyond the glaze of a helmet window , did not look at ease . Loman was muttering . He must have been at it , off and on , for a long time: I wouldnt be surprised if you were around , Prell . Or even you , Dukas . I was right! I know all about your little self , Prell . It was all in your dead brain . You think youll play a reverse David against Goliath , eh ? If blasting out your lab didnt kill you . . . .  No , Ed Dukas was not so easily defeated . The aura of neutrons thrown out only by scattered filaments was probably not of continuous intensity . At certain points there might well be chinks in it , at which time he could slip to close quarters without having his own nuclear metabolism speeded up to the point of his destruction . But before he did anything final , he had to find out where Prells stolen equipment was .  Ed felt the whir of the air-filtering apparatus in the room and smiled . And there was a television globe nearby . Ed could have found ways , now , to make his own tiny voice audible to his enemy and to challenge him . But Ed decided against this for the present . He mustnt waste precious time , yet he suspected that he could depend on the restlessness of a nervous foe not to wait here quietly very long .  Again he was right . Perched on a ledge made by an irregularity of the wall , Ed waited less than five minutes before Carter Loman jumped up from the bed , cursed , and dashed from the room . Eds Midas Touch cylinder reddened in his hand as he jetted after him . Of firmer flesh than other men , Loman hurried untiring , even in his massive armor and plastic helmet , down a back stairs , passing a hundred levels .  Then he was in a small , powerful car racing along a civic speedway that Ed remembered well . Clinging to plush that was like a dense forest under him , Ed remained undislodged by the tornadoes of air that came from speed .  Around him passed beauty that he used to know , expanded so enormously that much of the familiar mood of it was lost; and he himself seemed cut off from it , like a ghost coming back . But there was other , perhaps greater beauty , too--closer to the heart of what he was now . Thered been a controlled shower induced by the weather towers . Now the sun shone again , and the air sparkled , not with dust , but with countless tiny droplets of moisture--crystal globes , clear as lenses , but breaking the sunshine into brilliant prismatic hues .  Eds brief rambling of mind ended when Loman did an odd thing . He stopped in Eds old neighborhood , after having passed a half-dozen road blocks where uniformed men had entrenched themselves , covering their ugly vehicles with cut branches . Loman had only flashed his Interworld Security badge at each post , to receive respectful permission to go on .  Loman stopped his car abruptly before a house adjacent to Eds own--one Ed knew well . But Ed had an odd feeling that this was not as strange as it seemed . This suburb , close to the City , harbored many of the noted and notorious . Besides , many recent turbulent events had been centered within these few hundred square miles . And Loman had been in the neighborhood before , in the company of Police Chief Bronson . Also , had there always been something disturbingly familiar about Lomans manner ?  Ed tingled at the unraveling of an enigma , as Loman hurried up the walk to the house . Loman found the door locked , but if this annoyed him , it stopped him not at all . An armored shoulder , backed up by the muscles of his kind--their power rarely demonstrated publicly--battered the door to splinters and Loman stepped through .  Ed followed him--as unobtrusive as part of the atmosphere--up a stairway and into a pleasant student room seen in colossal scale .  It was Les Paytens room which had thus been invaded without ceremony . Nor was the intruding colossus the least abashed that the giant Les , somewhat thinned down and pallid after his long convalescence from a visit to Abel Freeman , was present .  Ed saw his old friends startled expression , then felt the vibration of his words: Chummy , arent you , bursting in like this ? The police , eh ? What have I done ? My God , Ive seen your picture! Youre Loman!  The other giants smirk was half gentle , half bullishly humorous . Thats my name--if you prefer , he said . Ive had you watched , Lester Payten , for various reasons . Youve been ill . Then why do you stay so close to what may become the battle lines ? Youre an odd guy , Lester . Too much fear , courage and conscience . Wanting to be a hero , but half a martyr . Recently one of the reasonable kind . Soon there wont be any of those left . Not when a few more see those they love torn open , crisped or perhaps crushed by created things more hideous than Tyrannosaurus Rex . Such facts destroy the folly of thoughtfulness . And , good! For in that way the showdown comes against another kind of slime that desecrates the form of man! Youre a mixed-up kid , Lester--maybe even thinking of some old companions . But in your heart you know that youre all human . Me , Im still sentimental , so I had to come to you at last . You ought to be safe among the asteroids , like your timid mother .  Being an audience to these comments , Eds first puzzlement changed slowly toward comprehension of a weird truth . Drifting with the air molecules near the center of the room , he watched Les Payten sitting quietly at his desk , his look also showing that he was at the fringe of understanding . But maybe his mind half refused to plunge into the starkness of fact beyond . Too much had become possible . Sometimes it might be a land too strange for human wits .  Maybe primitive terror prompted Les to sudden violence . Or it was the sickening cynicism in Lomans words . In a flash of movement Les tried to get a weapon from his desk . Confronted by a human being , he might have succeeded . But Loman even dared , first , to shut off the neutronic aura around his armor , so as not to burn or kill the one he had come to see . Then quick fingers latched onto Less wrists . Les fought with all his might but was pushed down on the floor . Dazed , he looked up at his conqueror .  Yes , your memory-man father killed himself , Loman said . But he could always return by recording , couldnt he ? Before that , it was all arranged--with many who sympathized with the human cause . The mind probe showed that my expressed views were truthful . Interworld Security could use someone who was clever , unknown , and supremely active . Umhm-m--maybe Im even harder than they hoped! Yes , Im still an android , Les , because I have to be strong for battle . I hardly care who learns of it now , because the fight is sure to come . But Ill be a man again , when and if I can . And , like a man , I love my son . Things will become very difficult soon , Lester . So I want you with me .  Lomans heavy growl might have sounded paternal to common ears . But he capped it with a light tap to Less jaw . Les crumpled . For a moment this fantastic echo of his original sire , changed in face and form , stood over him , an armored demon by any standard .  The sun had set . From the twilight beyond the window came blue flashes , light heat lightning , off toward the wooded hills . They glinted on Lomans plastic face window , which had muffled his words scarcely at all . Loman seemed to match those flickers: science misused; wisdom , once reached for so carefully , fading; the collected armaments , improvised quickly by a master technology hidden in tunnel and on mountain-top , by both sides . And the guts of a star ship engine perverted . Once , on a lost Moon , a thing like that had exploded , just by error or chance . There had been no wild speeches to bring it about . Nor any panic . And there had been no Lomans to help in a more savage way .  Unless driving impulses were checked , the end could come this very night . Ed even wondered if he might waste valuable time sticking close to Loman any longer . Would it lead to more answers , as he had felt it must ? Well , he still was sure of that , and Loman also seemed driven by haste . So Ed alighted on Less shoulder and burrowed into the cloth . It was the safest thing to do . For whatever weapon might be used , it probably would not be directed at Les .  Loman picked up the unconscious form and dashed out to his car . There followed a wild ride along winding roads through the woods . Distantly , on a hilltop , Ed saw a metal framework slanting skyward . It held a cylinder whose neutron beam could level anything . But its power supply could mean complete destruction in a last resort to madness , for revenge--if someone lost control of himself , smashed the safety stops on controls , pushed levers a little beyond them .  There were wrecks on the road . Horror had been exchanged already , as refugees fled the City . Beside one broken car , half fused to a puddle of fire lay the body of a child , briefly glimpsed . And Ed detected a mans cries and protests , flung wildly at the sky from among the shadowy trees . Or could it have come just as well from an android throat ?  If it was Jones of common human clay or Smith , an android , could it make any difference ? Yet it was an old thing--a reasonable mans anguish against wrong .  Still , was it hard to see a sequel , when something snapped in the brain ? A kind of explosion . Then , before horror and rage , immortality or death could become equally meaningless . Good sense and kindness , once clung to desperately , could then become zero , and Earth , sky and humanity empty phantoms . Then could you picture the wronged one awaiting someone of the other kind ? Could you picture him aiming his own weapon at another car and holding its trigger down until his own curses were lost in the roar of incandescence ?  Ed Dukas rode on through the dusk in Lomans car , still clinging to the fabric at the shoulder of his inert friend , Les Payten . The sky still flickered--warning barrages , not yet aimed to kill . An aircraft swooped , its weapons shredding a high-flying horror that was not of metal . Some had been destroyed , but others always came--though they never had been truly numerous . A few other cars sped along the road--persons fleeing the dangerous congestion of the City .  Ed wondered if the steady ping ping ping in his quartz-chip radio was the ultra-sonic evidence of a spy beam in action , perhaps meant to trace Lomans course ? At last the forces of law might do that to their own , if some of them disagreed with Lomans zeal or suspected that it had become too extreme . Chief Bronson , for one , had seemed a likable man . Besides , even after a mind probe , many would mistrust an android .  Ed reasoned that this must be a flight to a hide-out , which he had to see .  The car careened for a mile along a narrow side road , where , behind high banks , the pinging stopped . Had Loman counted on their shielding effect ? Deeper in the woods , a block of undergrowth folded upward on a hinge , and the car rolled inside . Then the great trap door closed behind it . Ed was not surprised even by so elaborate a retreat as this . Now , with his neutronic aura cut off , Loman bore Les through a low doorway , into a great , low chamber fused out of bedrock . Could Loman and Mitchell Prell be as alike as this in their choice of secret places ? Queer--and yet not so queer . Both were scientists . Prell had invaded the field of biology and Loman , in his original incarnation as Ronald Payten , had been a biologist from the start .  Ed might have attacked , now that Lomans aura was inactive . But it could be restored in an instant . Better to wait . A clearer chance might well come . His enemy might even be trying to lure any small , unseen intruder close to the coils of the aura .  Besides , in the soft artificial light , answers lay--answers that Ed had only dimly suspected , in spite of Lomans background . Since he had learned who Loman was , there hadnt been time enough for him to understand . But now the solution to a dreadful mystery came easily , because Ed could intrude here unseen .  There were vats here , too , vaster than any Ed had ever seen from any viewpoint and webbed with their attendant apparatus . Beneath the glossy surface of the fluid , like smooth oceans in the floor , various shapes were visible--all devilish but half transparent in their undeveloped state , their smooth plates of vitaplasm muscle and scale showing , but already alive and in slight , undulating motion . And no doubt these things were only in the embryonic state . They could grow much huger after being set free to hide and kill . Here , then , was the devils brewpot of creation . Here the first slithering synthetic monsters must have been blueprinted and created . It was Ronald Paytens work--the product of his skill and his secret quirks . Madness in vitaplasm , to help build hate between android and man and bring the conflict to a climax .  And there was more . Against one wall was the plunder of Mitchell Prells laboratory on Mars--or most of it . The tanks were empty . But on a table stood the larger microscope , as if what could be seen through its eye-piece had been under examination . Perhaps the doll-like shape , the other vats , the machine shop and that tiny electron microscope were still there . And what lay at a still lower size level . Across such a void of distance , Ed Dukas could not see such detail . But he felt the mingling of hope and frustration . No path back to normal circumstances was here , yet . And the time was certainly not ripe--if it would ever come . Besides , did all of him really want to return , even if part of him fairly ached for it ?  Carter Loman , or Ronald Payten , bent close to Les , his pronged helmet and wide face , beyond the curve of plastic and radiation shielding , like an ugly world in the sky . But if you had the mind to notice , perhaps Lomans expression was almost gentle just then . His voice came to Eds senses as a subdued and modulated quake: Lester! Wake up! I didnt hit you that hard .  Les seemed to have been lowered onto a couch of some kind . Perhaps he had already regained consciousness moments ago and had since been bent on quiet scrutiny of his surroundings , seeking out comprehension and the core of his own feelings . Ed could guess at some of this: an enigma revealed; Ronald Payten--creator of monsters; Les Paytens pseudo-father . Then , for Les , horror , shame , fury .  For Ed , the world seemed to rock as Les leaped . Les was not strong now and was still in his convalescence . And maybe he had been wavering and unsure , or even wrong in his past choices . But at this moment he was not at all in doubt , though the attack he made could have been pure , wild fright .  Father , indeed! Ill kill you--Phony! he screamed . Then he was grappling with Loman with all the strength that muscle and emotion could muster .  For that moment at least , he was Ed Dukass ally , willing or otherwise . For he held Lomans attention diverted . And because of Less attack Lomans neutronic aura remained turned off .  Ed leaped and jetted , his tiny Midas Touch a scarcely visible spark as it flamed . He landed on the fabric near the back of Lomans neck and at the base of his helmet . Holding tight , Ed let his weapon flare again , this time using it to blast a tiny hole . He braved the violent spurt of energy from the dissolving rubberized fabric and then the moment of exposure to radiation and heat as he crept through . Now he floated in Lomans private atmosphere , within the great oxygen helmet , as Lomans struggle with Les went on .  Now was the time to test a plan: the speck-sized man against a being of human dimensions--comparatively as huge as a mountain . And it was android against android , advantage against advantage .  Lomans lungs , active now to give breath to a chuckle of triumph , breathed Ed in deeply . With his full equipment still lashed to his shoulders , he tumbled down through moist and faintly ruddy gloom . When the air currents quieted , he clung , a sharp splinter of obsidian rising and falling in his hand , as he cut through soft tissue .  Thus he reached a small artery and was borne along by the flow within it . It was a world of warm , buried rivers . Dim , rosy light sometimes found its way through the walls of flesh . Or was it , still the radioactive glow that Lomans body , adapting to the shortage of oxygen , had shown on Mars ? But its physical structure , apart from its substance , remained human: the disklike red blood corpuscles pumped along in the gloom .  Only wait now to be circulated to the right position . Ed knew when he passed the great thumping valves and chambers of Lomans heart . But , no , this was not the place for action . He could feel himself rising now . Good! Was the darkness within the skull denser than elsewhere ? Ed forced his way into constantly narrowing channels . Around him he still saw very dimly the living cells themselves . Here they had long , interlocking filaments . They were the brain cells , beyond question .  He dared not use his Midas Touch here . The fluid at its very muzzle would have exploded . But he had grenades of much the same function . Set the fuse of one and leave it lodged here .  Before Ed was pumped back to the huge lungs , he felt the heavy concussion . Then came the wild gyrations of the colossus . A spark of atomic incandescence had exploded within its head , opening arteries to hemorrhage and destroying surrounding tissue with heat and radiation . A demoniac vitality of body might linger on , but a mind was dead . Had total death come quickly , all movement ceasing , Ed might have had to tunnel his way tediously from the gigantic corpse .  But his luck held out . He reached the lungs , and a great burst of air flung him forth into the oxygen helmet again .  Lomans form still twitched on the floor . One enemy was erased from the immediate future at least . Loman--or the pseudo Ronald Payten--had been removed as an active force of history , but the fury he had helped stir up was by now self-sustaining . Ed gave him a brief , almost rancorless thought . A woman had lost her husband in the Moonblast . And he was her memory re-created . She had had reason to hate science . And he had been warped and marked by her view . He was a bitter product of his times--impossible in the centuries that came before . Ed knew that he himself--as he was now , certainly--was also the child of his era . His uncle must always have been that . Babs--wherever she was now--was also of these years . And his dad , and countless others . Maybe , therein you had to find a tiny spark of tolerance for Loman , though not much . And would anyone ever want to bring him back to life , even if the world went on existing ?     IX   Eds score stood at two points gained--Loman out of the way and the source of the monsters revealed . But these were small victories compared with what must be gained if there was to be any hope . Masses of human beings and androids faced each other , their emotions inflamed to the point of final folly . And the end of one troublemaker and the revelation of his tools were small items beside all that .  Ed got out of Lomans oxygen helmet the way he had entered . Les Payten , a dazed Atlas , was stumbling around . Ed felt cut off from his old friend by a strange , great distance . But he could talk to him at least .  Ed floated to the radio in a corner of the workshop , found his way through a vent in its back , and touched a wire with the minute contact points of a crude microphone as large as his hand . The infinitesimal electric currents it bore were amplified and converted into sound . Eds voice came forth loud and clear: Les! Its me--Ed Dukas . Im here , just as Prell came to me once . Im an android just a few thousandths of an inch tall . Im inside the radio , Les . First , I want to know how you feel about all this . Yes , I killed Loman .  There were world tremors of footsteps approaching with slow caution . A panel of the set was opened . The giant stared inside . Ed was now sufficiently accustomed to the vibrations of human speech to interpret the mood behind them .  There was a brief , hard chuckle , controlled and distant and unfriendly .  Yes , Dukas , Im quite sure its as you say . Its odd , maybe , but Im not surprised at all . In our time , you have to accept too much . Thanks for finishing Loman--not my father . Dad died on the lunar blowup , as you know , a victim of technology or history , as we all will probably soon be . Ive told you before how I feel about everything . And what has happened to me tonight can scarcely have made my view of the androids any kinder . Once upon a time , in my callow youth , I thought I belonged to this crazy period . How wrong can you get ? You take your strength and durability . I wonder what finer flavors of life youve lost . So theres my standard , and Ill live and die by it , Dukas . Its sad to lose a pal , but as you are , I guess youll have to be an enemy . Its like an instinct , Dukas .  Les had spoken calmly and firmly . But Ed sensed the bitterness and uncertainty that lurked beneath the words .  I wont argue , Les , he answered . But when Im thinking straight , the truth to me is still as it was . In championing man above android , or vice versa , you can only come to zero . Only in fair play between them is there a chance . So , if the urge ever comes over you , you might still do me a favor . Across this room is a microscope and attached equipment that are vital to me and to Barbara , who is like me , somewhere . Guard it , Les . No place that you could reach is perhaps truly safe for it . But I was thinking that if you could gamble again--as we all must--you might take it to Abel Freeman . I know that you were almost killed in his camp , Les . But I believe that the old reprobate is fundamentally sound and not as bitterly against such a device as some human beings might be . Thanks if you consider it , Les .  Still unseen by his one-time friend , Ed jetted to the vaulted ceiling and escaped through a ventilator pipe that emerged among concealing bushes . He rose above the trees , and a night wind pushed him on , while he listened to the quartz chip he carried . His first impulse now was to locate Tom Granger as his next candidate for silence .  It was not necessary . The news was on the air: Granger was stricken in his quarters just before eight oclock . The cause is not yet clear . He had just begun to write his new speech: I am frightened . We are all frightened . But this can change nothing of our purpose . In vitaplasm we are confronted by a vampirish fact: an identity of face masking a difference of spirit . A treachery . A slow , dreadful encroachment . . . .  Prell had gotten to Granger , then . If this was murder , maybe it was justified--if Earth was one per cent less in danger with one exhorter quieted , for a while if not forever . But what had been accomplished so far was small beside the threat that had been stirred up in many minds and machines across the countryside .  The sky was heavy with thickening clouds . Weather Control , working through its ionic towers had already been smashed . The night was alternately a Stygian hole or a glare-lit holocaust full of battering vibrations which might mean that real battle had already begun . So far , only neutron streams were being used . Where a mountain peak was hit there would be a blaze of light that even an android had better not look at . Then another mountain , looming over a different fortified line , would flare up and glow with moving lava . And the power that energized the weapons was the same as that which could reach the stars .  Rising high and jetting forward with his Midas Touch , Ed went to work . He thought of Abel Freemans camp , which lay somewhere beyond the carpet of flaming woods which flanked one slope . But that was not his immediate destination now . He had dived for a power station house in a great trailer--and did it matter whether it belonged to the older race or the newer ? He took great risks getting into its busy vitals . The constricting pressure of space warps , creating a gravity pressure of billions of tons to the square inch , eased gradually . A marble-sized bit of super-dense matter , crushed and compressed by the force and hidden by its opaqueness , began to expand to meter-wide size and to lose its blinding heat and fury as the processes within it stopped . Soon the power plant , turning out a flood of electricity out of all proportion to its small size , ceased to function . Scattered atoms of hydrogen and lithium became inert .  There was no easily visible cause for the breakdown , until puzzled eyes found minute holes burned in vacuum tubes , allowing air to enter , oxidizing grids and filaments and stopping their action .  Two great weapons died , their energy cut off . But the power stations themselves were the far greater threat , for they harbored that sun-stuff within them . Now the controls of one , which some enraged person might contrive to push too far in spite of the watchfulness of others , were temporarily useless .  Working both sides of the line , Ed sabotaged another energy source , and another . Then he lost count , not because of a high score , but because heat and radiation had fogged his mind somewhat . Yet he kept at his labors because there was no other way . Within every square mile there was enough potential power to end his planet .  Around him , curses came vibrating from giants: Men , eh ? Jelly for insides! . . . Stinking Phonies--Hell-born or Prell-born! . . . Jim , I was wondering , this fizz-out looks fishy . Do you suppose the bastards have something ?  The front had quieted . It could be that , as far as he had gone , Ed had actually held the Earth together by spiking a few danger points . But he could take no pride for himself out of this . The job could go on and on , like a few buckets of water poured on a forest fire . It helped briefly , yet if there had been a thousand like him , but truly indestructible , the situation might still be without promise . The mass of the populace was too enormous and scattered; the natural suspicion and the forces which had stirred it up were too deep . The ghosts of Loman and Granger still walked in memory and maybe now in martyrdom . And the technology was still there . So Ed knew that , unless there was another way , he could only go on attempting to lessen a threat , until heat and radiation or its fulfillment zeroed him out .  It took him over an hour to stop one power station because his demoniac vitality was ebbing and because it had begun to rain heavily . The great drops could not kill him , but like falling lakes , they could hammer him into the mud , from which it might take days for him to extricate himself . He waited in the shelter of a loose bit of bark on the trunk of a tree . There he felt the helpless side of his smallness .  As he waited , his mind rambled . Had several groups of weapons quit without his noticing , or was this only something that he wished were so ? Where was Barbara now ? Would he ever see her again ? . . . Now he lost himself in a fantasy . He saw them leaving Earths atmosphere the way they had come--she and he together; maybe finding beauty and peace out there . Perhaps there were even tiny worlds--meteors--inhabited by crystalline things such as they had once seen but advanced to a state where they could think and build , and be friendly .  And , almost wistfully , he thought of another idyl--his fathers , and even Grangers , among millions of others . He could almost see the crude charm of the houses , the gardens and the flocks . But how did one erect a wall against science--with science ? It seemed harder to do than diking the water out of the deepest ocean and trying to live in the hole thus made .  The rain ended . Ed was air-borne again . He caused one more power station to break down . But there were others . And some that he had spiked might already be repaired . And from his quartz chip he heard other exhorting voices--not Grangers , but like Grangers . The old and human traits that Granger had represented could go on without him , fighting maturer thoughts as if in a drive toward suicide . Who could be everywhere , to quiet such clamoring ?  In the darkness before dawn , Ed felt desperate and hopeless . His mind was on Abel Freeman again--the memory man , somebodys cockeyed family legend . It was an instinctive thing to seek out the strong for advice , for discussion and perhaps for a joining of forces .  Ed had only part of an energy cartridge left for his Midas Touch . But this was more than enough to jet him across the mountains to the camp of the quaint android chieftain with whom he must now admit a kinship of flesh . Freeman was certainly a local leader now among those of the same mark who had fled from the City , where the population was predominantly of the old kind . Technicians , craftsmen , specialists of every sort , would be among Freemans following .  Just as first daylight began , Ed drifted over the vast , hodge-podge encampment hidden in the woods and the marshes . Part of the ground it covered had been fused to hot , glassy consistency , perhaps by a small aerial bomb . Maybe a hundred Phonies had died there--which fact added nothing to the cause of peace .  Abel Freeman himself was not too hard to find , for he occupied a central , commanding position among various equipment housed in great trailers carefully concealed from any observer in an aircraft . But Abel Freeman , true to his legend , was sitting inside a rude shelter of boughs , which effectively concealed the light of his ato lamp . Before him was a sensipsych training device and a vast pile of books on many subjects , ranging from military tactics to atomics , on which he was obviously endeavoring to get caught up . He was savagely intent upon book learning , for which he had little aptitude . But Ed , seeing him in mountainous proportions , was perhaps better able than others to understand why androids in need of leadership flocked to his stamping grounds . Abel Freeman looked like the essence of rough and ready ability . Among android leaders , he was certainly the greatest .  Freeman had a small radio receiver beside him . Ed Dukas did not try to read the meaning of its blaring vibrations , for he was aware of their general tone . To him the instrument was chiefly a possible bridge of communication between himself and Freeman .  But Ed was not now given the chance to make such contact . For something else happened . From the pages of an opened book in Abel Freemans hands coiled a thread of smoke , as charred words were written rapidly across the paper . Ed was close enough in the air to read them , too: I am Mitchell Prell , who helped make your kind possible . I am one of you now--though undersize . Help keep the peace . Make no moves to start trouble .  Ed himself was startled . His uncle was here , then! They had arrived at almost the same time . And Prell had chosen a more dramatic means of communication--not ink , not an amplified voice , but the spiderweb-thin beam of his Midas Touch used as a long stylus , while he clung , perhaps , to a hair on the back of Freemans hand!  For an instant , Abel Freeman was gripped by surprise . But then , with rattlesnake-swift movement , his own Midas Touch was in his hand . His whole self seemed to take on the smooth flow of perfect alertness which nothing but an utterly refined machine could have equaled .  Prell or a liar ? he challenged . Or Prell with a conscience--for his own first people and against his brain children ? Yes , Ive heard how little you might be now .  Ed had only glimpsed his uncle far off among the scattered motes of the air--another mote among them--a foot away he must be , at least . But Ed hadnt waited for contact . Instead he darted quickly inside Freemans radio , touched the contacts of his microphone to the proper surface , and spoke: Maybe youll remember me , too , Freeman . Im Dukas , Prells nephew . You and I have talked before , man to man . Prell is no liar . And the conscience is there--for everybody , android or otherwise . Yes , Im with him , the same size . And theres a problem , everybodys problem , the toughest one that Ive ever heard of . So where do we get any answer that makes sense ? Some of it has got to come quickly , Im afraid , Freeman .  Amplified , Eds voice had boomed out till it was like an earthquake to him . Once again a plastic box was opened above him and a gigantic face was overhead . In the tinkling overtones of smallness , there was almost a silence for a moment . Then came the rattle of Freemans hard , amused laugh , as he said , Ill be damned! Smaller than snuff and made the cheap way . People . Something better . Yep , it must be so , even if I cant even see you . That puts us way ahead , I guess . And it aint a whisky vision . Well , I guess it still dont make any difference . The old-time kind of folks hate us , and theyll never stop while both of us and them are alive . And us Phonies have been crowded all we can take . Theyve fired on us here , just barely trying to miss . Could be weve done the same to them . Its a mighty ticklish proposition . In winktime they could finish us all here , nice and clean and no grease left . So could we burn them quicker than gunpowder . So who gets trigger crazy and does it first ? Weve fixed them: an answer , under the ground . Maybe they can spoil our other weapons , like it seems they can , but not this one . Its buried deep enough . Let em try to hit us hard , and itll set everything off . Your old Moonblast will be beat a thousand times . Us Phonies are bullheaded . We were made on Earth , same as them . Its ours as much as theirs . We came alive , and we can fade out again , young fella!  The vibrations of Freemans tones rose and fell , with humor , fatalism and stubbornness . Two races , one born of the knowledge originated by the other , seemed to have driven each other into corners of no return . At some indefinite instant , the Big Zero would come .  Ed saw this garish picture more clearly than ever before . His strange little body fairly quivered with it . He looked at Mitchell Prell , who had come beside him now , where the pieces of apparatus that made up the interior of a small receiving set loomed , and he saw in his face the puzzled , tired fear of a scientist whose researches had always aimed at doing good . Just then Ed Dukas , micro-android , was far from separated from the Big Earth as he used to know it . So now , in desperation , he clutched at a vision which had once seemed almost a fact .  Freeman , he said , maybe men cant back down or co-operate with supermen . Doing that can seem like embracing extinction . But hasnt there always been an obvious thing for us to do ?  Umhm-m--you mean we should back down , Freeman replied softly . Set out for the wide-open spaces that we were meant for . Leave the poor clodhoppers behind . Young fella , could be that you and me see things bigger . For others like us , it ought to be like that , only it aint--yet . Most of the new people are butcher , baker and candlestick maker , Earth-born , and Earth-tied in their minds , like anybody . Theres a ship , sure . But the stars are still awful far off , and never touched , and you can go addled just thinkin about them . Lots of our sort would leave in their own sweet time , same as regular folks , sure . Its in their blood . You might say they got wings . But who really knows how to use em yet ? And crowd our kinfolks off their home world ? When theyre spunky and sore like any human being ? Nope . Sorry!  Eds faint hope faded before the old androids realism . For years the movement of migration had been farther and farther outward into space . It was at once a fact , a dream and a philosophy , like getting nearer to the Eternal Unknown . But most of the worth-while solar system was already owned by the original dominant species . Beyond was only the distance , not a beaten path at all , an untried and fearsome novelty . One star ship was about completed , yes . Fast it would be , but its speed would still fall far short of the velocity of light . So the nearer stars were decades , centuries , millenniums away .  An idea so familiar that it seems almost an accomplished fact can lose some of its charm in the hard glare of real obstacles . Ed felt something like a chill inside him . Though he knew the strangeness of a micro-cosmic viewpoint , others did not have this training and boldness for the unknown . He saw the majority of them balking fatally . But he still had to try something , to change as much of this as he could--if he could change any of it at all .  I dont know whether or not to blame you and the others for the revenge you say is rigged here and elsewhere , Freeman , he said . I can see why both sides felt driven to do it . But Im going to borrow your newscast facilities , Freeman . Or someone elses . Because rumor can be a powerful force . And I think I can give it a little push .  Mitchell Prell was still beside him . His grin was encouraging and sly . Best of luck in what you intend , Eddie , he remarked . Need a charge for your Midas Touch ? . . . Meanwhile , I might try drawing the teeth of some dragons , as you seem to have been doing . Got to be careful , though , that both sides dont blame each other and get nervous . Granger , poor knothead , was easy . I hope that somehow circumstances will be right so that he can come back and learn . About Loman and the things he made , I can feel differently .  You heard ? Ed asked .  It was on the air , Prell replied . Somebody phoned the news in from near that lab . At least the overwise ones will know that they guessed wrong about which faction contrived a biological horror: a rabid old-race sympathizer , but an android , too! Can that make either side proud ?         *       *       *       *       *  A minute later Ed landed on the roof of the trailer which housed Freemans wireless equipment . He crept past an immense drop of rain water that loomed like a rounded mesa beside him and entered a vent . Soon he touched the terminals of his microphone to the proper contacts . The transmitter was active . During the first pause between the temblors of other words and signals and coded information , Ed spoke quickly , half like a mischievous sprite . This is no ghost voice . We hear that many androids want to take all of their kind beyond the solar system .  The station did not stop sending at once . Blame that on the startled monitor , who must have been listening . Ed took advantage of his opportunity . He was granted another moment to speak: It is only natural that they should want to do that . Their kind of vigor matches the stars . They dont need , or really want , the Earth . Their departure in peace could be a perfect answer to everything .  That much Ed got out before the transmitter clicked to silence . He knew he hadnt said anything original and that he had pushed an argument intensely , like a high-pressure salesman without full belief . What he had said was the way things should be , perhaps , but were not . Yet , again , like a romantic kid , had he felt the glamorous impact of his own words ?  He was aware that androids would hear and millions of the old race--intent on communications from an enemy station--as well . A mysterious , informal voice was always a thing to draw attention , and his remarks had been rather startling . That they would be repeated and discussed a thousand times from other stations was probable . For they were like a chink of hope in one of two granite walls of obstinate righteousness and strength .  But Ed decided that hed build no bright pictures of what his speech would accomplish but would wait for hard facts . He wished desperately that hed had a moment more to speak on the transmitter , to call out Barbaras name .  Now he drifted again in a morning sunshine . Luck had held out this far at least . But over woods and crude shelters and hidden equipment and grimy grim-faced hordes that looked as human as refugees could , there were interruptions that denied optimism . A patrolling rocket ship sailed high; an intensified neutron beam turned a finger of air white hot behind it--very close . And mountaintops , already truncated and smoking , still would flare up dazzlingly . Android muscles and backs strained and bent to build fortifications as nothing merely human could . The toilers were both men and women . Could android children cry ? Yes , some did .  Another thing happened . Ed , floating unseen low in the air , felt the buzz of shouts and cries . A man who seemed to be near collapse was being helped forward by a youth whose sidearms dangled near the knees of his torn dungarees . At a little distance , where size seemed more as it used to be , Ed saw that the exhausted man was Les Payten . He was mud from head to foot; his face and arms were bloodied by brambles , his suit was a rag .  He was brought straight to Abel Freemans shelter . There , supported by the armed youth , he spoke his piece: Im here again , Freeman , because a friend of mine asked me to bring you something for him . Does that make me a fool ? I know it does . Because hes only my remembrance of a friend now . Damn you all!  Les Payten fainted . A package wrapped in a plastic sheath fell from his hands , but Abel Freeman caught it . A couple of Abels ornery sons looked on , exchanging puzzled scowls . Freeman warned them away with a clenched fist , knotty as an oaken club , and then shouted , Nancy! Oh , Nancy-y-y! But there was no time for Ed to observe Freemans hellion daughter functioning as a nurse . He went inside Freemans radio again , and spoke , Freeman , this is Dukas . I came to you to give and receive help . That means that Ive tried to guess right about you . I believe I have . When your neo-biologists examine what Payten has brought , they will be able to guess its value to me and mine . And I think that they will be able to combine its uses with those of their own equipment for something Id like to see done . But there are other matters . Some of your power plants broke down , but so did others across the line . I did most of that . Prell must be doing more of it right now . What I said over your wireless was meant to gain a little time .  Ed paused . Freeman did not open the radio case again . Ed couldnt see him . He could only feel small thuds and clinkings--the android leader opening the package that Les Payten had brought . Ed wondered if he could ever imagine what was going on in Freemans head , the thousand problems and feelings that must be seething there .  Freeman might be no good at book learning . And his roots were in a century when even a flying machine was a wild thought . But he had to be shrewd to match the legend behind him . And he had to take tough situations with a light shrug for the same reason .  Finally Ed felt the rumble of his chuckle . You mean Im one of your reasonable variety , he said . Meantime you smash my stuff , eh , little bug in the air! I ought to get damn unreasonable! You might even finish me off! Im kind of curious about that! But I dont think you have to bother . I know that the old-time folks are moving lots more hell machines up . And theyre awful mad , because we got quite a few of them in one place last night--sort of by miscalculation . Whats this talk about us androids matching the stars ? Well , young fella , go head and talk some more . Yep , on our wireless rig . Whats left to lose ? And Im still curious .  On the way to the radio trailer , Ed looked back to the ugly , humping shapes of weapons creeping up a high , blackened slope a few miles away . This was fresh action by men of the old kind who had lost friends or family and who saw no future in a demoniac succession . They were exposed , an easy target . But if they were destroyed , others would come . So they dared and defied , and the vicious spiral toward Big Zero continued to mount .  Ed tried to forget this for a moment . His first words by wireless were a call for his wife: Babs , this is Ed , at Freemans camp! Barbara , come to us if you can . At least , try to communicate with us . You know how . Barbara! . . .  She had her own quartz chip , active all the time , so she must hear! And if she did , she could send a message just as he did , from some other station . But though Ed now had help , at Freemans orders , no reply from his wife was sifted from the countless communications that were received .  But his previous attempt to spread a rumor had brought some expected results . The morning air was full of conflicting comments:  . . . A cruel joke  . . . Psychological warfare  . . . Perhaps , but what if the Phonies mean to leave ? Some already deny it . . . . Who spoke ? Let him speak again .  Ed was glad to oblige , even revealing his name , his present dimensions and how a being of such size , equipped with a Midas Touch , might wreck a power station . He explained this last item because he did not want a misplaced blame to stir up more tension on both sides . Otherwise , he addressed himself mostly to the androids , aware that the old race would listen , too .   . . . We were made on Earth , but not for Earth . We were meant to go much farther . Since we have so much , to be other than generous would be stupid . We have peace and the future , and most of what man ever hoped for , in our hands . That , or oblivion for everyone .  Though the ominous movement on the burned-out slope continued , the actual flash of weapons seemed suspended . The quiet was either promising or it was ominous .  He was lulled into enough confidence so that at noon he took a break . He went back to Freemans shelter and into the tiniest workshop that Mitchell Prell had made and that Les Payten had rescued . He dropped from the air beside minute machines and the vats that had given Barbara and him their micro-android forms on Mars .  The whole piece--the greater microscope together with all the much lesser equipment--Abel Freeman had unwrapped hastily , so that entry into the twilight within the plastic cover had been easy . Freeman himself was not around .  For a moment Ed felt alone and wistful , clinging to the rough glass floor of the shop . But then he saw a faintly luminous elfin figure .  Barbara! he exclaimed .  Her laughter tinkled . Think I wasnt come back , Eddie ? she teased . That I couldnt share any interest in what happens to a big world ? Her blitheness almost angered him . Her expression sobered at once , and he saw that she looked worn . I know , she said . Its not funny . We might have burned up with the Earth--far apart . But I kept busy . I tried to call you yesterday from a station in the City . But I wasnt sure I touched the proper contacts . And last night I had to be a good saboteur . I got three weapon-feeding power houses--though I guess that the fine equipment could be shielded against us easily enough . Later , I was lost--high up in the wind . With you along , it could have been wonderful . Of course , I heard news broadcasts . About Lomans lab . And from Freemans station , a report of how Les arrived with a strange device . This morning I heard your call , but there was no way to answer . Eddie , Freemans experts could copy us in normal size quite easily and quickly , couldnt they ? And in better vitaplasm . The methods have been improved . Our personal recordings , perhaps lost , wouldnt be needed . Should we try to have it done ? Then thered be two of each of us , in different sizes . Two . . . .  Ed chuckled . Not a word about returning to the old flesh , eh ? he said . So have we learned ? Android freedom to go anywhere , to be almost anything . Yep , magic almost . I think youd rather perch on thistledown or a sunset cloud , or be pushed by light pressure , like sleeping spores , to a thousand light-years away! Well , it could still happen . Part of us has been changed enough by things like that to belong there . But the older part seems much like it was and belongs to the size plane that we first knew about .  They hugged each other and laughed . And they were reassured by the comparative calm around them . But the forces were still there , only awaiting someones ultimate madness . And what can a worlds end be like , coming in a split instant , to ones dissolving senses ? Certainly it must be a quick , almost trivial experience .  Ed became aware of a bluish flicker . Then there was something like an awful thud; he could scarcely tell whether a crash of sound took part in it or not . Around him everything was dazzling whiteness , without shadow or form . Then there was nothing .     X   Consciousness came back to him , bringing a cloudy surprise . Rough rocky walls were around him . This was an artificial cavern crowded with neo-biological equipment , most of which he could recognize . He lay firmly on a hard couch contrived of planks and a folded blanket , part of the latter covering him . A pair of dungarees and a mended shirt had been tossed casually across his bare torso .  Someone who looked like a young medico laughed near him .  One weeks time , Dukas--thats all we need now for a major transformation , he said . You must have thought that we were all goners; it would have seemed like that to you . But it was just a freak attempt at sniping from the hills , with a Midas Touch focused to a thin beam . Whoever tried it must have been aiming at our chiefs shelter . Only he wasnt there! Still down in miniature , you were caught in the backlash of the blast . But it only knocked you out and singed you a little . You kept holding onto some solid object . Your wife and the equipment were scarcely hurt at all . Then Prell showed up again . They talked with our chief the way you did before . They engineered the transformation . I thought youd want to know all this quickly .  The youthful android looked good-humoredly awed . They just stepped out , he added . Theyll be back in a minute .  Ed began to slide into his dungarees . He was grateful for his return to something like what he had been . His memories of an interlude when people were mountain tall were clear , yet they didnt seem quite to belong to himself .  He thought briefly of how he must have been brought back to normal size--his micro-form in one of the vats of similar proportions acting as a pattern , electronic brain and all . In another vat , which Freemans specialists had connected , the gelatins must have filmed and solidified slowly , taking shape , while in brain cells and filaments--different from electronic swirls but capable of assuming the same connecting arrangements--a personality was reproduced without destroying the pattern . With Barbara and Prell it had been the same .  The world goes on , I see , Ed remarked .  The android biologist smiled wryly . Some of that is your fault , Dukas , he said . A matter of advertising . You made enough old-timers half believe that the Earth will go on being theirs . That cooled them off some . As for our kind , what you said started lots of them thinking again along what ought to be a natural track . Certainly the prompt departure of almost all of us is the only answer that can really solve anything . Yes , if that isnt far too large an order! Though I rather wish it were possible . . . . Here come Prell and your lady . Ill disappear .  They looked almost as they used to look--before anything about them was changed . Blame the loss of some trifling birthmark or scar here and there on the simplification of details that had occurred during a step down to smallness . Yet Mitchell Prells china-blue eyes were as good-humored as ever and Barbaras smile as bright and warm .  So here we are , Eddie , she said gaily . And what we recently were are still around somewhere--alive and aware , and the same as we were , though not quite us any more . Separate , but still helping , Im sure . And if we all get through all right , well , their universe is as wonderful and even vaster than ours .  Prell scowled for a moment , as if he envied his lesser likeness the continued chance to study the structure of matter , down where molecules themselves seemed bigger and nearer . But then his shoulders jerked almost angrily , as if to shake off the scientists woolgathering . Come on , Ed , he snapped . Abel Freeman has been pushing the idea you expressed , talking it around the world to all the androids . He says that , crazy though it is , hell encourage it .  They emerged from the cavern into the afternoon sunshine of the camp . A sudden quiet had come over it . Eyes were staring up toward the east , while bodies tensed for a dive for whatever shelter was at hand . Something moved there with seeming slowness , though its gray hue , like a distant mountain peak , told that it was seen through all the murky heights of the atmosphere and was in free space beyond . Its motors were inactive . High sunshine brought metallic glints from its prow . It was certainly miles in length . Its presence could mean doomsday . But it was magnificent! If it could set human blood to coursing more swiftly , how must it affect an android ?  The star ship! someone shouted . Others took up the cry: The star ship . . . . The star ship . . . .  Now Abel Freemans voice boomed from a sound system: Yep , youre right . I sent a call for it to come in from the asteroids . Figured it would be good for all our tough-gutted breed to look at! Uh-huh , tough gutted , I said , but might be Ill have to take that back . Anyhow , a man made for a mule loves a mule on sight . So how about men and a ship made for the stars ? But might be you aint that kind of folks--you only seem that way . Might be you can only see the mud on the ground and not the sky . I dunno . Moving all of us fast would take an awful lot of insides . But aint she a beauty ? I figure that the folks that brought her here didnt like to disobey orders , but they figured that letting us see was necessary . Maybe theyre Phonies , too . I figure that Harwell , who bossed her construction , would be that now . Her kind of purpose demands it . But maybe you aint up to what shes for . And you folks of the old kind , what do you say ? What if we did leave you alone on Earth ? What if you gave us this first star ship and let us build more , out on a moon of Saturn where you dont go much ? Lets hear some answers!  Obviously , Abel Freemans words were also being broadcast . Meanwhile the star ship glided into the sunset . Someone spoke briefly from her by radio . Harwell ?  I hope you convince everybody , Freeman . I believe it does make sense . Not a cinch , though , even for us .  That , too , came out of the address system , as the ship headed back toward its base .  In his newer self , here on Earth , Ed breathed again , and his breathing was rapid . Once more the unseen future was a thrill . Yet he must not let glamour gild harsh uncertainties too much .  He looked at the faces around him . Some were stern , some grinned in bravado under Abel Freemans challenging sarcasm , but in most of them there was a special , eager light , almost avid . It looked as if Freemans talk and the great craft that had come with it were turning the trick . But these were trivial dramatics , too . The real source of success--if it was that--was in a basic kinship of android vigor with the stars . Awakened , it could relinquish the Earth without regret . These people could feel a little like lesser gods now . Their strength and endurance matched the next step of progress . Now the fantastic gulf of distance didnt seem as wide as Freeman had once thought .  From scattered android camps , messages came in , pointing generally toward deeper space . Yes , doubts were expressed .  Shall we leave our homes without even an argument ? Are we complete fools ?  Yes , fools if we dont leave . We can make a mass departure . And remember that this is the only solution . Are they still too primitive for us to live with ? The same fault might be ours . I wonder what they will say to our proposition ?  Communications also flashed back and forth among the old race:   . . . They look like us but arent . Their disguise and their powers hold a warning . No wonder so many of us think of them as something like medieval demons . Can we trust what they say ? Or is it a trick to disarm us ? How can we know ? Yet they intrigue us . Man has always sought to borrow strength and permanence from the rocks and hills . Are they that achievement ? And we ourselves have wanted the stars .  Crouched over the small receiver in Freemans restored shelter during that still-ominous afternoon , Ed and Barbara listened and waited . Around them they found both humor and pathos . In another shelter , dug into the rocks and soil , they located Les Payten , whose misfortunes with the Phonies had been many . His bitter frankness had won him dislike here . He had been put under restraint . There was the bearish tenderness and nursing of the gorgeous and powerful Nancy , Freemans daughter , who stood beside him now , her big blue eyes expressing a mixture of soulful devotion and hunger about as rapacious as that of a starved hound-dog six inches from a fat rabbit . Les didnt seem to appreciate it at all . But he still tried to be a friend to his companions of a lost youth . Babs! Ed! he exclaimed at sight of them . So you got back--to size , anyhow! But you could go back to where you began , as natural creatures! Damn , once we were young idiots , dazzled by a sense of wonder into too much tolerance . I dont want to be something synthetic! Cant you two realize the fundamental truth of that--for yourselves ? Good Glory! Wake up!  Eds grin was one-sided . For one thing , I suspect that going back all the way wouldnt quite work , Les , he said mildly . We are what we are now , thats all . Theres a cloudy sort of limit on switching bodies . There can never truly be two of anyone . Besides , we like being what we are . And should I remind you that , in common with all animals , man is a natural machine ? As for being synthetic , I assure you that both love and poetry are there as well . So what do you imagine that we lack that the old timers always had ? A taste for turkey or cake ? Just lead us to it! Were human , Les--our forms and ideals and feelings are as they always were . Were not devils . Were not truly separated from the old race in any part of sympathy . Were just people gone on--I hope!--a little further .  Ed spoke gently , as he must to a tired , confused friend . Or was it to a whole , vast section of humanity , dumfounded by hurtling technology , proud and stubborn about what had seemed its eternal self , and dreading any change which could seem so darkly drastic ?  Barbara tried , too . Why dont you join us , Les ? she urged . If you became like us , you would know! Besides , even if all the androids leave the Earth , the knowledge of how to mold vitaplasm wont be taken away with us . People here will continue to be destroyed in accidents , as has always happened . So that knowledge will be needed and used . Besides , some persons will change willingly . Some people may want to shut themselves away from such realities . But I dont think that they can . Theyll have to learn to accept facts .  Les Payten looked at his old companions oddly , as if tempted by an old soaring of the fancy . Then the light died in his eyes . Nice logic , he said coldly . I could almost trust it if I didnt remind myself . A mechanical treachery . My Ed Dukas and Barbara Day are dead .  His tone was calm , yet there was a quiver in it--perhaps of revulsion for these imponderable likenesses before him , whose hearts he thought he could not--or did not--want to see .  Ed was exasperated before a stubbornness of thought habit which was partly fear , though Les Payten was no coward . Some human minds were quick to adjust , taking even the radical newness of the last half century in their stride . But there had always been many others who were slow . Perhaps it was a childish taint , a resisting of maturity . And how could they keep pace now ? But right there , Ed had to remind himself not to be too sure of himself . The next day or minute might trip him up .  There seemed no further way to argue with Les . Ed could only express his sincere thanks for a favor , offer good wishes , and shrug lightly and in some mockery , for one who refused what seemed a simple truth . If that shrug was superficially unkind , perhaps it was also a goad in the right direction . A favor to a pal .  An hour later , when Ed told Freeman of Les Paytens reactions , the colorful android leader had a similar comment: Theres maybe billions like that--one reason why we got to leave . Theyll change . But right now , who cares to take the ornery kid brothers fishing ? Give em time to grow up a little more , first . It wont be so long . Just now we got our own problems and jobs . They aint small , and nothings certain . Theres no hole to jump into thats as deep as deep space! I thought once that it couldnt happen . But now it looks as if were gonna get the chance to try!  Abel Freeman was right . That evening a message came from the World Capital: Let us meet and confer with android representatives and earnestly apply ourselves to a binding solution .  That was the beginning . It seemed that reason had won out after all . Freeman and Prell were flown to the Capital . Ed did not go , for he foresaw a bleak conference with the single purpose of getting an arrangement made as soon as possible . This proved to be true . To the androids went the first star ship , its asteroid base , provisions to be delivered regularly over a ten-year period , supplies and equipment of all kinds , and the use of Titan , largest of distant Saturns moons .  To the vast majority of the androids this was enough . To the few grumblers there would be scant choice . Let them view themselves as exiles , borne along by the eager mass of their kind .  When Freeman and Prell returned to camp after the signing of the treaty , Les Payten had already left for the City . For a while Nancy Freeman would look wistful . She was strong and beautiful , and perhaps not as wild as her personal legend . Briefly , Mitchell Prells eyes rested on her . Then he chuckled .  Sirius , he said . Nine light-years away . Not the nearest star , and not perfect . But the best bet of the nearest . Alpha Centauri is a binary , too . Bad for stable planetary orbits . But in the Sirian System , at least we know now that there are many planets . Come on , Freeman . There are more plans to straighten out .  Preparations began , and the weeks passed . Once Ed even went shopping with his wife--for the pretty things , symbols of the luxury and sophistication of Earth , that she wanted to take with her into the unknown . Was that the crassest kind of optimism before the harshness that could be imagined ?  Ed , Barbara and Prell would be among the many thousands to be packed into the first star ship for the first long jump . They had earned the privilege of choice . Abel Freeman had elected to stay behind , to help direct operations on Titan .  Interplanetary craft were moving out in a steady stream , transporting migrants and the prefabricated parts needed to set up a vast glassed-in camp that few of the old blood could ever have tried to build . The androids might even have endured the cold poison of Titans methane atmosphere without protection . But they had inherited , and could not easily throw off , earthly conceptions of comfort . And they had their rights . The countless things needed to build other star ships would soon begin to follow them .  The first group of interstellar migrants didnt have to go anywhere near Titan . The star ship came to Earth again , to orbit around it . Small rocket tenders were there to bring the passengers up to the boarding locks .  At the take-off platforms , Ed Dukas saw his parents for the last time . Jack Dukas , who had chosen to remain on Earth with his wife , shook Eds hand warmly . Let them try their simple life of thatched stone houses on hillsides , Ed thought , let them defy what seemed a too involved civilization . Perhaps after the android exodus , some few would even make it work--on Venus , if not at home .  Ed hugged his mother . They had memories . Now Ed stretched optimism considerably . At last there can be a lot of time , Mom , he said . Enough so that we might even see each other again , someplace . . . .  Soon he and Barbara were up there in the great ship . To his touch , her arm was as smooth and soft as ever . Her hair was dark and thick , her eyes were bright with adventure , her skin a golden tan . And was it a loss that she could have bent crowbar with her bare hands , or have braved a vacuum at near absolute-zero temperature without harm ?  Youre insulting me in your mind , Ed , she joshed gaily . Not that Im much bothered . So the robot stoops to conquer , eh ? Of course we have no souls , Eddie .  Certainly not! he responded in the same manner . All our hopes spring from human sources . Even our firmer flesh was a human dream . Yet you can practically hear our mechanical joints creak . The old race was created perfect . Who could ever dare to make it any better ?  Eds sarcasm was honest . Yet he knew that before the unprobed distance , even the ruggedest of his kind were disposed to do a little whistling in the dark .  Around them in the ships huge assembly room , there were shouts , greetings , jokes and laughter . A young couple chatted brightly . A child studied a toy with serious petulance . A man consulted a notebook . Perhaps few here yet realized their range , power and freedom or just what they faced . Their environment had been narrow , like all earthly history . No doubt many were afraid of the strangeness and time and distance ahead . They had reason to be . Out there in the black pit of the galaxy , even giant stars could perish .  Mitchell Prell had not yet come aboard . Abel Freeman had already left for Titan--without his willful daughter . Schaeffer , the scientist , had gone with him .  Under Harwells commands , the colossal craft kept taking on migrants at top speed for thirty hours . They boarded in numbers out of all proportion to the available living space . Meanwhile there were needles to submit to . Vitaplasm could be more rugged and adaptable now than when it was first used . The fluids from hollow needles were the means of imparting the improvements .  At last the ship quivered slightly . In contact with the heat of fusion of hydrogen and lithium to form the gaseous stellar ash called helium , any material rocket chamber would have been scattered instantly as incandescent vapor . But space warps stood firm in their place , squeezing with an atom-crushing pressure of their own , natural only at the centers of stars . And now there was no secondary arrangement for the conversion of such power as was released into electricity . Even the helium became pure radiation that emerged in a stream . It was a continuous , directed explosion of light , far stronger within its narrow limits than the outburst of a supernova . It had been known for centuries that light had both mass and pressure , and here it was concentrated matter--the ultimate in propulsive thrust--changed completely to energy . On the sullen Earth , neither man nor android dared watch that thin thread of fury , while slowly the ship began to accelerate toward a five-figure number of miles per second .  It was the start of the departure of fear from an ancient race . Or so it was meant to be . From Earth , curses no doubt followed the ship--and sighs of relief , and regrets , and good wishes . This setting forth should have been a human triumph . Many would insist that it was not that . Others knew that it was .  Braced in a cubicle two meters long , one wide and half a meter high , Ed Dukas held his wifes hand . Tiered rows of other cubicles were around them . Mitchell Prell had been with them minutes ago , and he had simply said , Good night , half jokingly . Or was it more whistling in the dark ?  Just good night . Thats how itll be , sweet , Ed whispered now . The years wont mean anything . In the old mythology , the demigods could sleep for a millennium .  So the small spark of dread flickered out in them , as they invoked a power which they had used before , in smaller android bodies , and for a much shorter interval . No drug was needed . Their sleep became suspended animation .  Fine dust began to settle on them . But after forty years , measured by the ships chronometers--on the basis of a retarded time imparted to objects moving at high velocity , a somewhat longer interval must have passed on Earth--Ed was awakened to help patrol the vessel .  With a few other silent men , he moved through its ghostly , dimly lighted corridors and compartments inhabited by the living dead . The stillness was all around , and outside only the stars burned in the void . The decades had been like the passing of a night of sleep; yet now awake , Ed was aware that the time had gone , building up an unimaginable distance . Here was the abyss . It was a cold awareness which made him neither confident nor happy . Sometimes he looked down at Barbaras quiet face , but he did not wish her to awaken now .  Ahead was Sirius , brighter than before . Beside it , visible at least to the unaided eye , was the dim speck of its companion star , a white dwarf , shrunken and old , little larger than the Earth , but incredibly massive , the very atoms at its core compressed by its fearsome gravity and the weight of material above them . This dwarfs internal substance , largely pure nuclear matter , would have weighed tons per cubic inch .  Instruments , brought nearer to a destination , now showed more clearly , by the irregularities in the movements of this binary system , the existence of planets pursuing changing paths in the complicated cross drags of two stellar bodies revolving around a common center . Those worlds , known of on Earth for a quarter century , were still out of telescopic view . Their seasons must be crazy--hot , cold , uncertain . Yet other , nearer star systems had the same , and worse , drawbacks . And Sirius was relatively near , too . Besides , need an android worry about the fluctuations of mad climates so much ?  After a month , Ed Dukas relinquished his duties to others who were aroused briefly . He slept again , for more decades , and on through the first contact with a Sirian world . His mind still slightly blurred , he came down in a tender from the orbiting star ship , after others had landed . Barbara was with him . Somewhere far ahead , among hills rapidly shedding their glacial coat under hot sunshine , was Mitchell Prell .  The sunshine came from Sirius itself , farther away than the distance from Earth to Uranus; hence its size and brilliance were counteracted . Yet this world did not attend Sirius directly . It belonged to the white-hot speck at zenith--the dwarf with an almost equal attraction--tiny , but much closer . The planet hurried like a moon around this miniature sun .  Ed looked up at thin fish-scale clouds that were rose-tinted . Before him was a prairie covered with waving stalks bearing white plumes . Might you call them flowers blown by the wind ?  High up among the melting ice he saw a tower and maybe a roadway . Later he beheld two shapes , brown and rough , with four tapered , flexible limbs radiating from a central lump . Man , with his arms and legs , also has vaguely the form of a cross . But these were different , though sometimes they almost walked , and metal devices glinted in the equipment they wore . Had he dreamed all this somewhere years ago ? . . . Sometimes they rolled quickly like wheels , or they crept along , their limbs coiling . Once they flew , with bright flashes and without wings . But that was artificial . They moved off at last beside a shallow , salt-rimmed sea .  We cant stay here , Eddie , Barbara stated . It could be fascinating , but it would be worse than on Earth .  As everyone will realize , Ed Dukas answered .  So the explorers came back to the tender . Nearer to the dwarf sun they found a world with a more stable orbit and less extremes of cold and heat . If it was nearer the dwarf with its almost negligible radiance , it also did not approach as close to Sirius , nor swing so far away . It was a chilly little planet that had once been inhabited , too; but now there were only shattered stone and glass and rusted steel . Much of it was desert . But there were forests here and there , and high glaciers .  High on a clifftop in the thin , cold atmosphere , the refugees built their first city . It began with houses of rough logs and stone . But as time passed and the population increased , its metal-sheathed towers began to soar . In its glassed-in gardens , terrestrial flowers and trees thrived , while out of doors beautiful plants of a neo-biology easily surpassed in vigor the hardy local growths . There were theaters , stores and libraries . There was feminine fashion . Thus , nostalgically , an old earthly way was copied , though Earth was lost . There was no method to speak across the light-years . Earth might even belong to a somewhat different branch of time . But all this did not include the major point of separation . That was expressed in the way these people climbed the highest mountains without tiring and let the hoarfrost of fearsome cold gather on their bare faces without discomfort .  Sometimes , on blizzard nights , while they took the sleep that they did not need for more than the pleasure of it , Barbara and Ed would leave the windows open to the storm .  Roofs , buildings--why do we even bother with them ? Ed would say jokingly .  His wife would look at him somewhat worriedly , as if he meant it . As if here there were a bitter strangeness that lowered all earthly art and charm and comfort and sense of home to a futility . But then shed manage to laugh lightly , though often she didnt quite feel that way . You know why we bother , Ed , shed answer . Because we want to stay somewhat as we once were . Didnt you always agree to that ? Because its hard to change old habits and limitations , and grasp the freedom youre thinking about , Eddie . Sometimes I even suspect that we try to hide from that freedom .  Ed would scowl , feeling all of these thoughts , too . They had all the freedom that men had envisioned long ago: practical freedom from death , except from extreme violence; freedom from aging , freedom of mind , of action , of shape and size; the freedom of peace and plenty , and boundless energy . But beyond all this , like a goad , there often was , already , much more than a ghost of that ancient human restlessness that always had thrived on strength .  Are you happy here , Babs ? Ed asked once when there had been time to doubt .  By then they already had two young sons , born of new flesh in an old way .  Of course--reasonably , she chuckled . Though I have my moods . Then I dont quite know . . . . But , Eddie , this is the great , marvelous future , isnt it--the one we looked forward to with longing and wonder ? We ought to appreciate it completely .  It is that future . But now , sweetheart , its also just the present .  There were incidents to match such restless talk and thinking . There was Mitchell Prell , always groping for new things , shouting down from a cragtop , or from his laboratory , Hey , Ed! Barbara! Come here!  Maybe hed discovered a vein of ore that might be mined , or a strange specimen of hitherto unnoticed local fauna or flora . He remained a scientist , while Ed had become a mere builder of buildings .  More than likely , the woman Prell had married would be with him--she had been Nancy Freeman of a fantastic origin . That he had separated himself enough from his studies to take a wife was a minor miracle . That these so-different two should be together was certainly another . That she had learned to be both tasteful and poised , though no less vigorous than ever , had perhaps been hoped for by the first romancing thought that had given her real being on Earth .  To live in peace , comfort and beauty , Ed now realized , was not a final goal . The wild nomad , like Prell , shouting down from mountaintops , always seeking the unknown and straining to be bigger than his powers--however great they might have become--still had to be served . Otherwise pride was insulted , the urge to learn and progress was defeated; boredom set in , and centuries of life were not worth living .  Besides , belatedly , after years , there were voices , speaking out of wireless equipment in a way that Ed and Barbara Dukas and Mitchell Prell had reason to remember . That this world was now haunted by beings that floated with the dust in the air was a fact which in itself had an eerie , nomadic charm . Three tiny beings . No , now there were four .  Hello! Did you guess that we came with you on the star ship ? . . . But we stayed on that first planet . Then we visited others . Once we slept under a glacier--we dont know how long . Now we have built another biological workshop . So we will not be lonely . There will be many of us . I see you have done well . What comes next ?  Ed had the odd and startling impression of having been spoken to by himself . But he and a tiny speck of the clay of the half-gods were entirely distinct , even if their names were the same . The vast difference in size , enforcing separate thought patterns to meet the problems of different environment , had widened the gap further .  Its us! Barbara said .  Mitchell Prell and Nancy were also present just then , in the Dukas house . Perhaps the visitors had waited for them to be there .  I know who you mean , Nancy remarked . Your little folk , Mitch . Tell them something . Or do they embarrass you by being so strange ? Have you forgotten ?  Prell laughed somewhat unsteadily . Other interests had long ago taken his attention away from the small regions that were within the reach of android powers .  Theyre special friends , he said . We wont have any trouble talking to them . Hello yourselves!  So it was , for an hour . There was a mood of elfin charm , of expanded dimensions , of soft , rich colors; of physical laws wonderfully different in effect . The memory was haunting . But the larger Ed and Barbara had no present wish to return to that fantastic land . It was not their destiny .  So long for now . . . . The voices faded away playfully . But as Sirian time built Terran years , they were occasionally heard again , bearing a note of challenge .  The new city had grown huge . The surrounding country was becoming populous . And the inevitable happened , like part of a plan implanted in the nature of man from the beginning--to grow , to reach out , to be bigger in all things than he was before , though perhaps even to imagine the final goal itself was still beyond his intelligence and his experience . Now a more rugged body only made the drives stronger and the outcome more sure .  Still orbiting around this first colonial world , outside the old solar system and linked to the history of Earth , was the star ship , kept always in careful order . But on a small , jagged moon , a larger , better craft was under construction . It would have thrilled ancient blood; it could stir an android more .  Something sultry began to ache in Ed Dukass mind at the thought of restraint .  Some of us will have to go on , Babs , he said one dwarf-lit half-night . Blame it on fundamental biological law--in me , and the boys , too . Call it building an empire too big for any government . Maybe its an intended step--toward some other condition still out of sight . No doubt were far from the end of what we can become . I dont know . I dont really care . Im just a man and glad of it . I only know how I feel , and I suspect that , deep down , you feel the same!  For a moment Barbara was angry and sad . She still had a womans wish for permanence . She knew that Ed was thinking of other stars and their systems--red giants , flickering variables , bursting novae--a whole universe of mystery beckoning to a new kind of human . Even the ugly coal-sack clouds of cosmic dust could have their appeal . She herself was not beyond being intrigued by such things .  She walked across her pleasant room , which had begun to bore her a little , as Ed knew . Im game , she said mildly .  Inconceivably far off were other galaxies . Maybe Ed read her mind a little , as she thought of the vast , tilted swirl of the one in Andromeda , almost as big as their native Milky Way . It was the nearest , but so distant that all the light-years they had crossed could seem a mile by comparison . As a child she used to look at a picture of it and think that everything she could imagine , and much more , was there: books , musical instruments , summer nights , dark horror .  Ed and she were like the pagan divinities dreamed up wistfully long ago . Yet now she felt very humble .  Ed--  Yes ?  I was just wondering where God lives , she said .         *       *       *       *       *                             ABOUT THE AUTHOR   Ray Galluns stories have appeared in virtually every science-fiction magazine known to English-speaking man--Galaxy , Astounding Science Fiction , Amazing Stories , Marvel Tales , Startling Stories , etc . , etc . , plus Colliers , Family Circle , Utopia (Germany) , and various anthologies .

All the papers contained in this volume , except the two ethical ones (VIII and X) , have been previously published; and of those which have been previously published all , except that on "External and Internal Relations" (IX) , are here re-printed without change . They were written at various dates between 1903 and 1921 , and all are here printed in the order in which they were written , except that VIII on "The Conception of Intrinsic Value ," which was written earlier than VI and VII , has been moved out of its proper place in order to bring it nearer to IX and X , to both of which it is closely related in subject . All , except IV and X , were primarily intended for an audience familiar with the writings of philosophers; but I hope that they may nevertheless prove intelligible even to those who have read little or no philosophy , since I make little use of technical terms , and , where I have done so , have done my best to explain in ordinary language exactly what I mean by them . The tone of X is somewhat different from that of the rest , because it was written as a lecture for the Leicester Philosophical Society , with regard to which I was informed that I must not assume any previous acquaintance with philosophy in most of the audience . It accordingly bears marks throughout of the kind of audience for which it was intended . An attentive reader will easily discover that some of the views expressed in some of the papers are inconsistent with views expressed in others . The fact is that some of the views expressed in some of the earlier ones are views with which I no longer agree; and I feel that some apology is needed for nevertheless republishing them exactly as they stood . In all cases , except one , my excuse is that the mistaken views in question are so embedded in the form and substance of the papers in which they occur , that it would have been impossible to correct them without practically substituting new papers for the old ones; and that , in spite of these mistakes , the old papers , as they stand , still seem to me , on the whole , to say things which are worth saying in a form which , however defective it may be , I doubt my own ability to improve upon . The only case in which I doubt whether this excuse applies is that of the first paper--"The Refutation of Idealism ." This paper now appears to me to be very confused , as well as to embody a good many down-right mistakes; so I am doubtful whether I ought to have included it . But in this case I have another excuse: namely that it is a paper to which a good many allusions have been made by contemporary writers on philosophy; and I was told that , for some readers at all events , it would be a convenience that it should be re-printed along with the rest , if only for the sake of reference . I said above that the only one of the previously published papers , in which changes have been made , is IX on "External and Internal Relations ." In this case the changes are not due to any change in my views , but to the fact that , in that part of the paper in which symbols are used , I tried , when it was first published in the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society , to use the symbols adopted by Whitehead and Russell in Principia Mathematica , and used them also without giving an explanation of their meaning which would be sufficient for readers not acquainted with that work . The symbols in question are symbols which it is difficult for printers to reproduce; and I have , therefore , thought it better , on this occasion , to use another set of symbols , which seem to me to be adequate for the limited purpose I had in view . I have tried to give an explanation of their meaning , which will enable anyone to understand them; and I have taken the opportunity of rewriting some of the parts of the paper in which they occur in a way which will , I hope , make some points clearer than they originally were . I have to thank the Committee of the Aristotelian Society for permission to reprint the large number of papers (viz . , II , III , V , VI , VII and IX) , which originally appeared in the Proceedings of that Society; and the Editor of the New Quarterly for permission to reprint the article on Hume's Philosophy (IV) , which appeared in that Journal in November , 1909 . G . E . MOORE . CAMBRIDGE , January , 1922 . Philosophical Studies THE REFUTATION OF IDEALISM Modern Idealism , if it asserts any general conclusion about the universe at all , asserts that it is spiritual . There are two points about this assertion to which I wish to call attention . These points are that , whatever be its exact meaning , it is certainly meant to assert (1) that the universe is very different indeed from what it seems , and (2) that it has quite a large number of properties which it does not seem to have . Chairs and tables and mountains seem to be very different from us; but , when the whole universe is declared to be spiritual , it is certainly meant to assert that they are far more like us than we think . The idealist means to assert that they are in some sense neither lifeless nor unconscious , as they certainly seem to be; and I do not think his language is so grossly deceptive , but that we may assume him to believe that they really are very different indeed from what they seem . And secondly when he declares that they are spiritual , he means to include in that term quite a large number of different properties . When the whole universe is declared to be spiritual , it is meant not only that it is in some sense conscious , but that it has what we recognise in ourselves as the higher forms of consciousness . That it is intelligent; that it is purposeful; that it is not mechanical; all these different things are commonly asserted of it . In general , it may be said , this phrase 'reality is spiritual' excites and expresses the belief that the whole universe possesses all the qualities the possession of which is held to make us so superior to things which seem to be inanimate: at least , if it does not possess exactly those which we possess , it possesses not one only , but several others , which , by the same ethical standard , would be judged equal to or better than our own . When we say it is spiritual we mean to say that it has quite a number of excellent qualities , different from any which we commonly attribute either to stars or planets or to cups and saucers . Now why I mention these two points is that when engaged in the intricacies of philosophic discussion , we are apt to overlook the vastness of the difference between this idealistic view and the ordinary view of the world , and to overlook the number of different propositions which the idealist must prove . It is , I think , owing to the vastness of this difference and owing to the number of different excellences which Idealists attribute to the universe , that it seems such an interesting and important question whether Idealism be true or not . But , when we begin to argue about it , I think we are apt to forget what a vast number of arguments this interesting question must involve: we are apt to assume , that if one or two points be made on either side , the whole case is won . I say this lest it should be thought that any of the arguments which will be advanced in this paper would be sufficient to disprove , or any refutation of them sufficient to prove , the truly interesting and important proposition that reality is spiritual . For my own part I wish it to be clearly understood that I do not suppose that anything I shall say has the smallest tendency to prove that reality is not spiritual: I do not believe it possible to refute a single one of the many important propositions contained in the assertion that it is so . Reality may be spiritual , for all I know; and I devoutly hope it is . But I take 'Idealism' to be a wide term and to include not only this interesting conclusion but a number of arguments which are supposed to be , if not sufficient , at least necessary , to prove it . Indeed I take it that modern Idealists are chiefly distinguished by certain arguments which they have in common . That reality is spiritual has , I believe , been the tenet of many theologians; and yet , for believing that alone , they should hardly be called Idealists . There are besides , I believe , many persons , not improperly called Idealists , who hold certain characteristic propositions , without venturing to think them quite sufficient to prove so grand a conclusion . It is , therefore , only with Idealistic arguments that I am concerned; and if any Idealist holds that no argument is necessary to prove that reality is spiritual , I shall certainly not have refuted him . I shall , however , attack at least one argument , which , to the best of my belief , is considered necessary to their position by all Idealists . And I wish to point out a certain advantage which this procedure gives me--an advantage which justifies the assertion that , if my arguments are sound , they will have refuted Idealism . If I can refute a single proposition which is a necessary and essential step in all Idealistic arguments , then , no matter how good the rest of these arguments may be , I shall have proved that Idealists have no reason whatever for their conclusion . Suppose we have a chain of argument which takes the form: Since A is B , and B is C , and C is D , it follows A is D . In such an argument , though 'B is C' and 'C is D' may both be perfectly true , yet if 'A is B' be false , we have no more reason for asserting A is D than if all three were false . It does not , indeed , follow that A is D is false; nor does it follow that no other arguments would prove it to be true . But it does follow that , so far as this argument goes , it is the barest supposition , without the least bit of evidence . I propose to attack a proposition which seems to me to stand in this relation to the conclusion 'Reality is spiritual .' I do not propose to dispute that 'Reality is spiritual;' I do not deny that there may be reasons for thinking that it is: but I do propose to show that one reason upon which , to the best of my judgment , all other arguments ever used by Idealists depend is false . These other arguments may , for all I shall say , be eminently ingenious and true; they are very many and various , and different Idealists use the most different arguments to prove the same most important conclusions . Some of these may be sufficient to prove that B is C and C is D; but if , as I shall try to show , their 'A is B' is false the conclusion A is D remains a pleasant supposition . I do not deny that to suggest pleasant and plausible suppositions may be the proper function of philosophy: but I am assuming that the name Idealism can only be properly applied where there is a certain amount of argument , intended to be cogent . The subject of this paper is , therefore , quite uninteresting . Even if I prove my point , I shall have proved nothing about the Universe in general . Upon the important question whether Reality is or is not spiritual my argument will not have the remotest bearing . I shall only attempt to arrive at the truth about a matter , which is in itself quite trivial and insignificant , and from which , so far as I can see and certainly so far as I shall say , no conclusions can be drawn about any of the subjects about which we most want to know . The only importance I can claim for the subject I shall investigate is that it seems to me to be a matter upon which not Idealists only , but all philosophers and psychologists also , have been in error , and from their erroneous view of which they have inferred (validly or invalidly) their most striking and interesting conclusions . And that it has even this importance I cannot hope to prove . If it has this importance , it will indeed follow that all the most striking results of philosophy--Sensationalism . Agnosticism and Idealism alike--have , for all that has hitherto been urged in their favour , no more foundation than the supposition that a chimera lives in the moon . It will follow that , unless new reasons never urged hitherto can be found , all the most important philosophic doctrines have as little claim to assent as the most superstitious beliefs of the lowest savages . Upon the question what we have reason to believe in the most interesting matters , I do therefore think that my results will have an important bearing; but I cannot too clearly insist that upon the question whether these beliefs are true they will have none whatever . The trivial proposition which I propose to dispute is this: that esse is percipi . This is a very ambiguous proposition , but , in some sense or other , it has been very widely held . That it is , in some sense , essential to Idealism , I must for the present merely assume . What I propose to show is that , in all the senses ever given to it , it is false . But , first of all , it may be useful to point out briefly in what relation I conceive it to stand to Idealistic arguments . That wherever you can truly predicate esse you can truly predicate percipi , in some sense or other , is , I take it , a necessary step In all arguments , properly to be called Idealistic , and , what is more , in all arguments hitherto offered for the Idealistic conclusion . If esse is percipi , this is at once equivalent to saying that whatever is , is experienced; and this , again , is equivalent , in a sense , to saying that whatever is , is something mental . But this is not the sense in which the Idealist conclusion must maintain that Reality is mental . The Idealist conclusion is that esse is percipere; and hence , whether esse be percipi or not , a further and different discussion is needed to show whether or not it is also percipere . And again , even if esse be percipere , we need a vast quantity of further argument to show that what has esse has also those higher mental qualities which are denoted by spiritual . This is why I said that the question I should discuss , namely , whether or not esse is percipi , must be utterly insufficient either to prove or to disprove that reality is spiritual . But , on the other hand , I believe that every argument ever used to show that reality is spiritual has inferred this (validly or invalidly) from 'esse is percipere' as one of its premisses; and that this again has never been pretended to be proved except by use of the premiss that esse is percipi . The type of argument used for the latter purpose is familiar enough . It is said that since whatever is , is experienced , and since some things are which are not experienced by the individual , these must at least form part of some experience . Or again that , since an object necessarily implies a subject , and since the whole world must be an object , we must conceive it to belong to some subject or subjects , in the same sense in which whatever is the object of our experience belongs to us . Or again , that , since thought enters into the essence of all reality , we must conceive behind it , in it , or as its essence , a spirit akin to ours , who think: that 'spirit greets spirit' in its object . Into the validity of these inferences I do not propose to enter: they obviously require a great deal of discussion . I only desire to point out that , however correct they may be , yet if esse is not percipi , they leave us as far from a proof that reality is spiritual , as if they were all false too . But now: Is esse percipi ? There are three very ambiguous terms in this proposition , and I must begin by distinguishing the different things that may be meant by some of them . And first with regard to percipi . This term need not trouble us long at present . It was , perhaps , originally used to mean 'sensation' only; but I am not going to be so unfair to modern Idealists--the only Idealists to whom the term should now be applied without qualification--as to hold that , if they say esse is percipi , they mean by percipi sensation only . On the contrary I quite agree with them that , if esse be percipi at all , percipi must be understood to include not sensation only , but that other type of mental fact , which is called 'thought '; and , whether esse be percipi or not , I consider it to be the main service of the philosophic school , to which modern Idealists belong , that they have insisted on distinguishing 'sensation' and 'thought' and on emphasising the importance of the latter . Against Sensationalism and Empiricism they have maintained the true view . But the distinction between sensation and thought need not detain us here . For , in whatever respects they differ , they have at least this in common , that they are both forms of consciousness or , to use a term that seems to be more in fashion just now , they are both ways of experiencing . Accordingly , whatever esse is percipi may mean , it does at least assert that whatever is , is experienced . And since what I wish to maintain is , that even this is untrue , the question whether it be experienced by way of sensation or thought or both is for my purpose quite irrelevant . If it be not experienced at all , it cannot be either an object of thought or an object of sense . It is only if being involves 'experience' that the question , whether it involves sensation or thought or both , becomes important . I beg , therefore , that percipi may be understood , in what follows , to refer merely to what is common to sensation and thought . A very recent article states the meaning of esse is percipi with all desirable clearness in so far as percipi is concerned . 'I will undertake to show ,' says Mr . Taylor ,[1] 'that what makes [any piece of fact] real can be nothing but its presence as an inseparable aspect of a sentient experience .' I am glad to think that Mr . Taylor has been in time to supply me with so definite a statement that this is the ultimate premiss of Idealism . My paper will at least refute Mr . Taylor's Idealism , if it refutes anything at all: for I shall undertake to show that what makes a thing real cannot possibly be its presence as an inseparable aspect of a senient experience . But Mr . Taylor's statement though clear , I think , with regard to the meaning of percipi is highly ambiguous in other respects . I will leave it for the present to consider the next ambiguity in the statement: Esse is percipi . What does the copula mean ? What can be meant by saying that Esse is percipi ? There are just three meanings , one or other of which such a statement must have , if it is to be true; and of these there is only one which it can have , if it is to be important . (1) The statement may be meant to assert that the word 'esse' is used to signify nothing either more or less than the word 'percipi': that the two words are precise synonyms: that they are merely different names for one and the same thing: that what is meant by esse is absolutely identical with what is meant by percipi . I think I need not prove that the principle esse is percipi is not thus intended merely to define a word; nor yet that , if it were , it would be an extremely bad definition . But if it does not mean this , only two alternatives remain . The second is (2) that what is meant by esse , though not absolutely identical with what is meant by percipi , yet includes the latter as a part of its meaning . If this were the meaning of 'esse is percipi ,' then to say that a thing was real would not be the same thing as to say that it was experienced . That it was real would mean that it was experienced and something else besides: 'being experienced' would be analytically essential to reality , but would not be the whole meaning of the term . From the fact that a thing was real we should be able to infer , by the law of contradiction , that it was experienced; since the latter would be part of what is meant by the former . But , on the other hand , from the fact a thing was experienced we should not be able to infer that it was real; since it would not follow from the fact that it had one of the attributes essential to reality , that it also had the other or others . Now , if we understand esse is percipi in this second sense , we must distinguish three different things which it asserts . First of all , it gives a definition of the word 'reality ,' asserting that word stands for a complex whole , of which what is meant by 'percipi' forms a part . And secondly it asserts that 'being experienced' forms a part of a certain whole . Both these propositions may be true , and at all events I do not wish to dispute them . I do not , indeed , think that the word 'reality' is commonly used to include 'percipi': but I do not wish to argue about the meaning of words . And that many things which are experienced are also something else--that to be experienced forms part of certain wholes , is , of course , indisputable . But what I wish to point out is , that neither of these propositions is of any importance , unless we add to them a third . That 'real' is a convenient name for a union of attributes which sometimes occurs , it could not be worth any one's while to assert: no inferences of any importance could be drawn from such an assertion . Our principle could only mean that when a thing happens to have percipi as well as the other qualities included under esse , it has percipi: and we should never be able to infer that it was experienced , except from a proposition which already asserted that it was both experienced and something else . Accordingly , if the assertion that percipi forms part of the whole meant by reality is to have any importance , it must mean that the whole is organic , at least in this sense , that the other constituent or constituents of it cannot occur without percipi , even if percipi can occur without them . Let us call these other constituents x . The proposition that esse includes percipi , and that therefore from esse percipi can be inferred , can only be important if it is meant to assert that percipi can be inferred from x . The only importance of the question whether the whole esse includes the part percipi rests therefore on the question whether the part x is necessarily connected with the part percipi . And this is (3) the third possible meaning of the assertion esse is percipi: and , as we now see , the only important one . Esse is percipi asserts that wherever you have x you also have percipi that whatever has the property x also has the property that it is experienced . And this being so , it will be convenient if , for the future , I may be allowed to use the term 'esse' to denote x alone . I do not wish thereby to beg the question whether what we commonly mean by the word 'real' does or does not include percipi as well as x . I am quite content that my definition of 'esse' to denote x , should be regarded merely as an arbitrary verbal definition . Whether it is so or not , the only question of interest is whether from x percipi can be inferred , and I should prefer to be able to express this in the form: can percipi be inferred from esse ? Only let it be understood that when I say esse , that term will not for the future include percipi: it denotes only that x , which Idealists , perhaps rightly , include along with percipi under their term esse . That there is such an x they must admit on pain of making the proposition an absolute tautology; and that from this x percipi can be inferred they must admit , on pain of making it a perfectly barren analytic proposition . Whether x done should or should not be called esse is not worth a dispute: what is worth dispute is whether percipi is necessarily connected with x . We have therefore discovered the ambiguity of the copula in esse is percipi , so far as to see that this principle asserts two distinct terms to be so related , that whatever has the one , which I call esse , has also the property that it is experienced . It asserts a necessary connexion between esse on the one hand and percipi on the other; these two words denoting each a distinct term , and esse denoting a term in which that denoted by percipi is not included . We have , then in esse is percipi , a necessary synthetic proposition which I have undertaken to refute . And I may say at once that , understood as such , it cannot be refuted . If the Idealist chooses to assert that it is merely a self-evident truth , I have only to say that it does not appear to me to be so . But I believe that no Idealist ever has maintained it to be so . Although this--that two distinct terms are necessarily related--is the only sense which 'esse is percipi' can have if it is to be true and important , it can have another sense , if it is to be an important falsehood . I believe that Idealists all hold this important falsehood . They do not perceive that Esse is percipi must , if true , be merely a self-evident synthetic truth: they either identify with it or give as a reason for it another proposition which must be false because it is self-contradictory . Unless they did so , they would have to admit that it was a perfectly unfounded assumption; and if they recognised that it was unfounded , I do not think they would maintain its truth to be evident . Esse is percipi , in the sense I have found for it , may indeed be true; I cannot , refute it: but if this sense were clearly apprehended , no one , I think , would believe that it was true . Idealists , we have seen , must assert that whatever is experienced , is necessarily so . And this doctrine they commonly express by saying that 'the object of experience is inconceivable apart from the subject .' I have hitherto been concerned with pointing out what meaning this assertion must have , if it is to be an important truth . I now propose to show that it may have an important meaning , which must be false , because it is self-contradictory . It is a well-known fact in the history of philosophy that necessary truths in general , but especially those of which it is said that the opposite is inconceivable , have been commonly supposed to be analytic , in the sense that the proposition denying them was self-contradictory . It was in this way , commonly supposed , before Kant , that many truths could be proved by the law of contradiction alone . This is , therefore , a mistake which it is plainly easy for the best philosophers to make . Even since Kant many have continued to assert it; but I am aware that among those Idealists , who most properly deserve the name , it has become more fashionable to assert that truths are both analytic and synthetic . Now with many of their reasons for asserting this I am not concerned: it is possible that in some connexions the assertion may bear a useful and true sense . But if we understand 'analytic' in the sense just defined , namely , what is proved by the law of contradiction alone , it is plain that , if 'synthetic' means what is not proved by this alone , no truth can be both analytic and synthetic . Now it seems to me that those who do maintain truths to be both , do nevertheless maintain that they are so in this as well as in other senses . It is , indeed , extremely unlikely that so essential a part of the historical meaning of 'analytic' and 'synthetic' should have been entirely discarded , especially since we find no express recognition that it is discarded . In that case it is fair to suppose that modern Idealists have been influenced by the view that certain truths can be proved by the law of contradiction alone . I admit they also expressly declare that they can not: but this is by no means sufficient to prove that they do not also think they are; since it is very easy to hold two mutually contradictory opinions . What I suggest then is that Idealists hold the particular doctrine in question , concerning the relation of subject and object in experience , because they think it is an analytic truth in this restricted sense that it is proved by the law of contradiction alone . I am suggesting that the Idealist maintains that object and subject are necessarily connected , mainly because he fails to see that they are distinct , that they are two , at all . When he thinks of 'yellow' and when he thinks of the 'sensation of yellow ,' he fails to see that there is anything whatever in the latter which is not in the former . This being so , to deny that yellow can ever be apart from the sensation of yellow is merely to deny that yellow can ever be other than it is; since yellow and the sensation of yellow are absolutely identical . To assert that yellow is necessarily an object of experience is to assert that yellow is necessarily yellow--a purely identical proposition , and therefore proved by the law of contradiction alone . Of course , the proposition also implies that experience is , after all , something distinct from yellow--else there would be no reason for insisting that yellow is a sensation: and that the argument thus both affirms and denies that yellow and sensation of yellow are distinct , is what sufficiently refutes it . But this contradiction can easily be overlooked , because though we are convinced , in other connexions , that 'experience' does mean something and something most important , yet we are never distinctly aware what it means , and thus in every particular case we do not notice its presence . The facts present themselves as a kind of antinomy: (1) Experience is something unique and different from anything else; (2) Experience of green is entirely indistinguishable from green; two propositions which cannot both be true . Idealists , holding both , can only take refuge in arguing from the one in some connexions and from the other in others . But I am well aware that there are many Idealists who would repel it as an utterly unfounded charge that they fail to distinguish between a sensation or idea and what I will call its object . And there are , I admit , many who not only imply , as we all do , that green is distinct from the sensation of green , but expressly insist upon the distinction as an important part of their system . They would perhaps only assert that the two form an inseparable unity . But I wish to point out that many , who use this phrase , and who do admit the distinction , are not thereby absolved from the charge that they deny it . For there is a certain doctrine , very prevalent among philosophers nowadays , which by a very simple reduction may be seen to assert that two distinct things both are and are not distinct . A distinction is asserted; but it is also asserted that the things distinguished form an 'organic unity ,' But , forming such a unity , it is held , each would not be what it is apart from its relation to the other . Hence to consider either by itself is to make an illegitimate abstraction . The recognition that there are 'organic unities' and 'illegitimate abstractions' in this sense is regarded as one of the chief conquests of modern philosophy . But what is the sense attached to these terms ? An abstraction is illegitimate , when and only when we attempt to assert of a part--of something abstracted--that which is true only of the whole to which it belongs: and it may perhaps be useful to point out that this should not be done . But the application actually made of this principle , and what perhaps would be expressly acknowledged as its meaning , is something much the reverse of useful . The principle is used to assert that certain abstractions are in all cases illegitimate; that whenever you try to assert anything whatever of that which is part of an organic whole , what you assert can only be true of the whole . And this principle , so far from being a useful truth , is necessarily false . For if the whole can , nay must , be substituted for the part in all propositions and for all purposes , this can only be because the whole is absolutely identical with the part . When , therefore , we are told that green and the sensation of green are certainly distinct but yet are not separable , or that it is an illegitimate abstraction to consider the one apart from the other , what these provisos are used to assert is , that though the two things are distinct yet you not only can but must treat them as if they were not . Many philosophers , therefore , when they admit a distinction , yet (following the lead of Hegel) boldly assert their right , in a slightly more obscure form of words , also to deny it . The principle of organic unities , like that of combined analysis and synthesis , is mainly used to defend the practice of holding both of two contradictory propositions , wherever this may seem convenient . In this , as in other matters , Hegel's main service to philosophy has consisted in giving a name to and erecting into a principle , a type of fallacy to which experience had shown philosophers , along with the rest of mankind , to be addicted . No wonder that he has followers and admirers . I have shown then , so far , that when the Idealist asserts the important principle 'Esse is percipi' he must , if it is to be true , mean by this that: Whatever is experienced also must be experienced . And I have also shown that he may identify with , or give as a reason for , this proposition , one which must be false , because it is self contradictory . But at this point I propose to make a complete break in my argument . 'Esse is percipi ,' we have seen , asserts of two terms , as distinct from one another as 'green' and 'sweet ,' that whatever has the one has also the other: it asserts that 'being' and 'being experienced' are necessarily connected: that whatever is is also experienced . And this , I admit , cannot be directly refuted . But I believe it to be false; and I have asserted that anybody who saw that 'esse and percipi' were as distinct as 'green' and 'sweet' would be no more ready to believe that whatever is is also experienced , than to believe that whatever is green is also sweet . I have asserted that no one would believe that 'esse is percipi' if they saw how different esse is from percipi: but this I shall not try to prove . I have asserted that all who do believe that 'esse is percipi' identify with it or take as a reason for it a self-contradictory proposition: but this I shall not try to prove . I shall only try to show that certain propositions which I assert to be believed , are false . That they are believed , and that without this belief 'esse is percipi' would not be believed either , I must leave without a proof . I pass , then , from the uninteresting question 'Is 'esse percipi ?' to the still more uninteresting and apparently irrelevant question 'What is a sensation or idea ?' We all know that the sensation of blue differs from that of green . But it is plain that if both are sensations they also have some point in common . What is it that they have in common ? And how is this common element related to the points in which they differ ? I will call the common element 'consciousness' without yet attempting to say what the thing I so call is . We have then in every sensation two distinct terms , (1) 'consciousness ,' in respect of which all sensations are alike; and (2) something else , in respect of which one sensation differs from another . It will be convenient if I may be allowed to call this second term the 'object' of a sensation: this also without yet attempting to say what I mean by the word . We have then in every sensation two distinct elements , one which I call consciousness , and another which I call the object of consciousness . This must be so if the sensation of blue and the sensation of green , though different in one respect , are alike in another: blue is one object of sensation and green is another , and consciousness , which both sensations have in common , is different from either . But , further , sometimes the sensation of blue exists in my mind and sometimes it does not; and knowing , as we now do , that the sensation of blue includes two different elements , namely consciousness and blue , the question arises whether , when the sensation of blue exists , it is the consciousness which exists , or the blue which exists , or both . And one point at least is plain: namely that these three alternatives are all different from one another . So that , if any one tells us that to say 'Blue exists' is the same thing as to say that 'Both blue and consciousness exist ,' he makes a mistake and a self-contradictory mistake . But another point is also plain , namely , that when the sensation exists , the consciousness , at least , certainly does exist; for when I say that the sensations of blue and of green both exist , I certainly mean that what is common to both and in virtue of which both are called sensations , exists in each case . The only alternative left , then , is that either both exist or the consciousness exists alone . If , therefore , any one tells us that the existence of blue is the same thing as the existence of the sensation of blue he makes a mistake and a self-contradictory mistake , for he asserts either that blue is the same thing as blue together with consciousness , or that it is the same thing as consciousness alone . Accordingly to identify either "blue" or any other of what I have called "objects" of sensation , with the corresponding sensation is in every case , a self-contradictory error . It is to identify a part either with the whole of which it is a part or else with the other part of the same whole . If we are told that the assertion "Blue exists" is meaningless unless we mean by it that "The sensation of blue exists ," we are told what is certainly false and self-contradictory . If we are told that the existence of blue is inconceivable apart from the existence of the sensation , the speaker probably means to convey to us , by this ambiguous expression , what is a self-contradictory error . For we can and must conceive the existence of blue as something quite distinct from the existence of the sensation . We can and must conceive that blue might exist and yet the sensation of blue not exist . For my own part I not only conceive this , but conceive it to be true . Either therefore this terrific assertion of inconceivability means what is false and self-contradictory or else it means only that as a matter of fact blue never can exist unless the sensation of it exists also . And at this point I need not conceal my opinion that no philosopher has ever yet succeeded in avoiding this self-contradictory error: that the most striking results both of Idealism and of Agnosticism are only obtained by identifying blue with the sensation of blue: that esse is held to be percipi , solely because what is experienced is held to be identical with the experience of it . That Berkeley and Mill committed this error will , perhaps , be granted: that modern Idealists make it will , I hope , appear more probable later . But that my opinion is plausible , I will now offer two pieces of evidence . The first is that language offers us no means of referring to such objects as "blue" and "green" and "sweet ," except by calling them sensations: it is an obvious violation of language to call them "things" or "objects" or "terms ." And similarly we have no natural means of referring to such objects as "causality" or "likeness" or "identity ," except by calling them "ideas" or "notions" or "conceptions ." But it is hardly likely that if philosophers had clearly distinguished in the past between a sensation or idea and what I have called its object , there should have been no separate name for the latter . They have always used the same name for these two different "things" (if I may call them so): and hence there is some probability that they have supposed these "things" not to be two and different , but one and the same . And , secondly , there is a very good reason why they should have supposed so , in the fact that when we refer to introspection and try to discover what the sensation of blue is , it is very easy to suppose that we have before us only a single term . The term "blue" is easy enough to distinguish , but the other element which I have called "consciousness"--that which sensation of blue has in common with sensation of green--is extremely difficult to fix . That many people fail to distinguish it at all is sufficiently shown by the fact that there are materialists . And , in general , that which makes the sensation of blue a mental fact seems to escape us: it seems , if I may use a metaphor , to be transparent--we look through it and see nothing but the blue; we may be convinced that there is something but what it is no philosopher , I think , has yet clearly recognised . But this was a digression . The point I had established so far was that in every sensation or idea we must distinguish two elements , (1) the "object ," or that in which one differs from another; and (2) "consciousness ," or that which all have in common--that which makes them sensations or mental facts . This being so , it followed that when a sensation or idea exists , we have to choose between the alternatives that either object alone , or consciousness alone , or both , exist; and I showed that of these alternatives one , namely that the object only exists , is excluded by the fact that what we mean to assert is certainly the existence of a mental fact . There remains the question: Do both exist ? Or does the consciousness alone ? And to this question one answer has hitherto been given universally: That both exist . This answer follows from the analysis hitherto accepted of the relation of what I have called "object" to "consciousness" in any sensation or idea . It is held that what I call the object is merely the "content" of a sensation or idea . It is held that in each case we can distinguish two elements and two only , (1) the fact that there is feeling or experience , and (2) what is felt or experienced; the sensation or idea , it is said , forms a whole , in which we must distinguish two "inseparable aspects ," "content" and "existence ." I shall try to show that this analysis is false; and for that purpose I must ask what may seem an extraordinary question: namely what is meant by saying that one thing is "content" of another ? It is not usual to ask this question; the term is used as if everybody must understand it . But since I am going to maintain that "blue" is not the content of the sensation of blue , and what is more important , that , even if it were this analysis would leave out the most important element in the sensation of blue , it is necessary that I should try to explain precisely what it is that I shall deny . What then is meant by saying that one thing is the "content" of another ? First of all I wish to point out that "blue" is rightly and properly said to be part of the content of a blue flower . If , therefore , we also assert that it is part of the content of the sensation of blue , we assert that it has to the other parts (if any) of this whole the same relation which it has to the other parts of a blue flower--and we assert only this: we cannot mean to assert that it has to the sensation of blue any relation which it does not have to the blue flower . And we have seen that the sensation of blue contains at least one other element beside blue--namely , what I call "consciousness ," which makes it a sensation . So far then as we assert that blue is the content of the sensation , we assert that it has to this "consciousness" the same relation which it has to the other parts of a blue flower: we do assert this , and we assert no more than this . Into the question what exactly the relation is between blue and a blue flower in virtue of which we call the former part of its "content" I do not propose to enter . It is sufficient for my purpose to point out that it is the general relation most commonly meant when we talk of a thing and its qualities; and that this relation is such that to say the thing exists implies that the qualities also exist . The content of the thing is what we assert to exist , when we assert that the thing exists . When , therefore , blue is said to be part of the content of the "sensation of blue ," the latter is treated as if it were a whole constituted in exactly the same way as any other "thing ." The "sensation of blue ," on this view , differs from a blue bead or a blue beard , in exactly the same way in which the two latter differ from one another: the blue bead differs from the blue beard , in that while the former contains glass , the latter contains hair; and the "sensation of blue" differs from both in that , instead of glass or hair , it contains consciousness . The relation of the blue to the consciousness is conceived to be exactly the same as that of the blue to the glass or hair: it is in all three cases the quality of a thing . But I said just now that the sensation of blue was analysed into "content" and "existence ," and that blue was said to be the content of the idea of blue . There is an ambiguity in this and a possible error , which I must note in passing . The term "content" may be used in two senses . If we use "content" as equivalent to what Mr . Bradley calls the "what"--if we mean by it the whole of what is said to exist , when the thing is said to exist , then blue is certainly not the content of the sensation of blue: part of the content of the sensation is , in this sense of the term , that other element which I have called consciousness . The analysis of this sensation into the "content" "blue ," on the one hand , and mere existence on the other , is therefore certainly false; in it we have again the self-contradictory identification of "Blue exists" with "The sensation of blue exists ," But there is another sense in which "blue" might properly be said to be the content of the sensation--namely , the sense in which "content ," like εἴδος is opposed to "substance" or "matter ." For the element "consciousness ," being common to all sensations , may be and certainly is regarded as in some sense their "substance ," and by the "content" of each is only meant that in respect of which one differs from another . In this sense then "blue" might be said to be the content of the sensation; but , in that case , the analysis into "content" and "existence" is , at least , misleading , since under "existence" must be included "what exists" in the sensation other than blue . We have it , then , as a universally received opinion that blue is related to the sensation or idea of blue , as its content , and that this view , if it is to be true , must mean that blue is part of what is said to exist when we say that the sensation exists . To say that the sensation exists is to say both that blue exists and that "consciousness ," whether we call it the substance of which blue is the content or call it another part of the content , exists too . Any sensation or idea is a "thing ," and what I have called its object is the quality of this thing . Such a "thing" is what we think of when we think of a mental image . A mental image is conceived as if it were related to that of which it is the image (if there be any such thing) in exactly the same way as the image in a looking-glass is related to that of which it is the reflection; in both cases there is identity of content , and the image in the looking-glass differs from that in the mind solely in respect of the fact that in the one case the other constituent of the image is "glass" and in the other case it is consciousness . If the image is of blue , it is not conceived that this "content" has any relation to the consciousness but what it has to the glass: it Is conceived merely to be its content . And owing to the fact that sensations and ideas are all considered to be wholes of this description--things in the mind--the question: What do we know ? is considered to be identical with the question: What reason have we for supposing that there are things outside the mind corresponding to these that are inside it ? What I wish to point out is (1) that we have no reason for supposing that there are such things as mental images at all--for supposing that blue is part of the content of the sensation of blue , and (2) that even if there are mental images , no mental image and no sensation or idea is merely a thing of this kind: that 'blue ,' even if it is part of the content of the image or sensation or idea of blue , is always also related to it in quite another way , and that this other relation , omitted in the traditional analysis , is the only one which makes the sensation of blue a mental fact at all . The true analysis of a sensation or idea is as follows . The element that is common to them all , and which I have called "consciousness ," really is consciousness . A sensation is , in reality , a case of 'knowing' or 'being aware of' or 'experiencing' something . When we know that the sensation of blue exists , the fact we know is that there exists an awareness of blue . And this awareness is not merely , as we have hitherto seen it must be , itself something distinct and unique , utterly different from blue: it also has a perfectly distinct and unique relation to blue , a relation which is not that of thing or substance to content , nor of one part of content to another part of content . This relation is just that which we mean in every case by 'knowing .' To have in your mind 'knowledge' of blue , is not to have in your mind a 'thing' or 'image' of which blue is the content . To be aware of the sensation of blue is not to be aware of a mental image--of a "thing ," of which 'blue' and some other element are constituent parts in the same sense in which blue and glass are constituents of a blue bead . It is to be aware of an awareness of blue; awareness being used , in both cases , in exactly the same sense . This element , we have seen , is certainly neglected by the 'content' theory: that theory entirely fails to express the fact that there is , in the sensation of blue , this unique relation between blue and the other constituent . And what I contend is that this omission is not mere negligence of expression , but is due to the fact that though philosophers have recognised that something distinct is meant by consciousness , they have never yet had a clear conception of what that something is . They have not been able to hold it and blue before their minds and to compare them , in the same way in which they can compare blue and green . And this for the reason I gave above: namely that the moment we try to fix our attention upon consciousness and to see what , distinctly , it is , it seems to vanish: it seems as if we had before us a mere emptiness . When we try to introspect the sensation of blue , all we can see is the blue: the other element is as if it were diaphanous . Yet it can be distinguished if we look attentively enough , and if we know that there is something to look for . My main object in this paragraph has been to try to make the reader see it; but I fear I shall have succeeded very ill . It being the case , then , that the sensation of blue includes in its analysis , beside blue , both a unique element 'awareness' and a unique relation of this element to blue , I can make plain what I meant by asserting , as two distinct propositions , (1) that blue is probably not part of the content of the sensation at all , and (2) that , even it were , the sensation would nevertheless not be the sensation of blue , if blue had only this relation to it . The first hypothesis may now be expressed by saying that , if it were true , then , when the sensation of blue exists , there exists a blue awareness: offence may be taken at the expression , but yet it expresses just what should be and is meant by saying that blue is , in this case , a content of consciousness or experience . Whether or not , when I have the sensation of blue , my consciousness or awareness is thus blue , my introspection does not enable me to decide with certainty: I only see no reason for thinking that it is . But whether it is or not , the point is unimportant , for introspection does enable me to decide that something else is also true: namely that I am aware of blue , and by this I mean , that my awareness has to blue a quite different and distinct relation . It is possible , I admit , that my awareness is blue as well as being of blue: but what I am quite sure of is that it is of blue; that it has to blue the simple and unique relation the existence of which alone justifies us in distinguishing knowledge of a thing from the thing known , indeed in distinguishing mind from matter . And this result I may express by saying that what is called the content of a sensation is in very truth what I originally called it--the sensation's object . But , if all this be true , what follows ? Idealists admit that some things really exist of which they are not aware: there are some things , they hold , which are not inseparable aspects of their experience , even if they be inseparable aspects of some experience . They further hold that some of the things of which they are sometimes aware do really exist , even when they are not aware of them: they hold for instance that they are sometimes aware of other minds , which continue to exist even when they are not aware of them . They are , therefore , sometimes aware of something which is not an inseparable aspect of their own experience . They do know some things which are not a mere part or content of their experience . And what my analysis of sensation has been designed to show is , that whenever I have a mere sensation or idea , the fact is that I am then aware of something which is equally and in the same sense not an inseparable aspect of my experience . The awareness which I have maintained to be included in sensation is the very same unique fact which constitutes every kind of knowledge: "blue" is as much an object , and as little a mere content , of my experience , when I experience it , as the most exalted and independent real thing of which I am ever aware . There is , therefore , no question of how we are to "get outside the circle of our own ideas and sensations ." Merely to have a sensation is already to be outside that circle . It is to know something which is as truly and really not a part of my experience , as anything which I can ever know . Now I think I am not mistaken in asserting that the reason why Idealists suppose that everything which is must be an inseparable aspect of some experience , is that they suppose some things , at least , to be inseparable aspects of their experience . And there is certainly nothing which they are so firmly convinced to be an inseparable aspect of their experience as what they call the content of their ideas and sensations . If , therefore , this turns out in every case , whether it be also the content or not , to be at least not an inseparable aspect of the experience of it , it will be readily admitted that nothing else which we experience ever is such an inseparable aspect . But if we never experience anything but what is not an inseparable aspect of that experience , how can we infer that anything whatever , let alone everything , is an inseparable aspect of any experience ? How utterly unfounded is the assumption that "esse is percipi" appears in the clearest light . But further I think it may be seen that if the object of an Idealist's sensation were , as he supposes , not the object but merely the content of that sensation , if , that is to say , it really were an inseparable aspect of his experience , each Idealist could never be aware either of himself or of any other real thing . For the relation of a sensation to its object is certainly the same as that of any other instance of experience to its object; and this , I think , is generally admitted even by Idealists: they state as readily that what is judged or thought or perceived is the content of that judgment or thought or perception , as that blue Is the content of the sensation of blue . But , if so , then when any Idealist thinks he is aware of himself or of any one else , this cannot really be the case . The fact Is , on his own theory , that himself and that other person are in reality mere contents of an awareness , which is aware of nothing whatever . All that can be said is that there is an awareness in him , with a certain content: it can never be true that there is in him a consciousness of anything . And similarly he is never aware either of the fact that he exists or that reality is spiritual . The real fact , which he describes in those terms , is that his existence and the spirituality of reality are contents of an awareness , which is aware of nothing--certainly not , then , of it own content . And further if everything , of which he thinks he is aware , is in reality merely a content of his own experience he has certainly no reason for holding that anything does exist except himself: it will , of course , be possible that other persons do exist; solipsism will not be necessarily true; but he cannot possibly infer from anything he holds that it is not true . That he himself exists will of course follow from his premiss that many things are contents of his experience . But since everything , of which he thinks himself aware , is in reality merely an inseparable aspect of that awareness; this premiss allows no inference that any of these contents , far less any other consciousness , exists at all except as an inseparable aspect of his awareness , that is , as part of himself . Such , and not those which he takes to follow from it , are the consequences which do follow from the Idealist's supposition that the object of an experience is in reality merely a content or inseparable aspect of that experience . If , on the other hand , we clearly recognise the nature of that peculiar relation which I have called "awareness of anything"; if we see that this is involved equally in the analysis of every experience--from the merest sensation to the most developed perception or reflexion , and that this is in fact the only essential element in an experience--the only thing that is both common and peculiar to all experiences--the only thing which gives us reason to call any fact mental; if , further , we recognise that this awareness is and must be in all cases of such a nature that its object , when we are aware of it , is precisely what it would be , if we were not aware: then it becomes plain that the existence of a table in space is related to my experience of it in precisely the same way as the existence of my own experience is related to my experience of that . Of both we are merely aware: if we are aware that the one exists , we are aware in precisely the same sense that the other exists; and if it is true that my experience can exist , even when I do not happen to be aware of its existence , we have exactly the same reason for supposing that the table can do so also . When , therefore , Berkeley , supposed that the only thing of which I am directly aware is my own sensations and ideas , he supposed what was false; and when Kant supposed that the objectivity of things in space consisted in the fact that they were "Vorstellungen" having to one another different relations from those which the same "Vorstellungen" have to one another in subjective experience , he supposed what was equally false . I am as directly aware of the existence of material things in space as of my own sensations; and what I am aware of with regard to each is exactly the same--namely that in one case the material thing , and in the other case my sensation does really exist . The question requiring to be asked about material things is thus not: What reason have we for supposing that anything exists corresponding to our sensations ? but: What reason have we for supposing that material things do not exist , since their existence has precisely the same evidence as that of our sensations ? That either exist may be false; but if it is a reason for doubting the existence of matter , that it is an inseparable aspect of our experience , the same reasoning will prove conclusively that our experience does not exist either , since that must also be an inseparable aspect of our experience of it . The only reasonable alternative to the admission that matter exists as well as spirit , is absolute Scepticism--that , as likely as not nothing exists at all . All other suppositions--the Agnostic's , that something , at all events , does exist , as much as the Idealist's , that spirit does--are , if we have no reason for believing in matter , as baseless as the grossest superstitions .

THE NATURE AND REALITY OF OBJECTS OF PERCEPTION There are two beliefs in which almost all philosophers , and almost all ordinary people are agreed . Almost everyone believes that he himself and what he directly perceives do not constitute the whole of reality: he believes that something other than himself and what he directly perceives exists or is real . I do not mean to say that almost everyone believes that what he directly perceives is real: I only mean that he does believe that , whether what he directly perceives is real or not , something other than it and other than himself certainly is so . And not only does each of us thus agree in believing that something other than himself and what he directly perceives is real: almost everyone also believes that among the real things , other than himself and what he directly perceives , are other persons who have thoughts and perceptions in some respects similar to his own . That most people believe this I think I need scarcely try to show . But since a good many philosophers may appear to have held views contradictory of this one , I will briefly point out my reason for asserting that most philosophers , even among those (if any) who have believed the contradictory of this , have yet held this as well . Almost all philosophers tell us something about the nature of human knowledge and human perception . They tell us that we perceive so and so; that the nature or origin of our perceptions is such and such; or (as I have just been telling you) that men in general have such and such beliefs . It might , indeed , be said that we are not to interpret such language too strictly: that , though a philosopher talks about human knowledge and our perceptions , he only means to talk about his own . But in many cases a philosopher will leave no doubt upon this point , by expressly assuming that there are other perceptions , which differ in some respects from his own: such , for instance , is the case when (as is so common nowadays) a philosopher introduces psycho-genetic considerations into his arguments --considerations concerning the nature of the perceptions of men who existed before and at a much lower stage of culture than himself . Any philosopher , who uses such arguments , obviously assumes that perceptions other than his own have existed or been real . And even those philosophers who think themselves justified in the conclusion that neither their own perceptions nor any perceptions like theirs are ultimately real , would , I think admit , that phenomenally , at least , they are real , and are certainly more real than some other things . Almost everyone , then , does believe that some perceptions other than his own , and which he himself does not directly perceive , are real; and believing this , he believes that something other than himself and what he directly perceives is real . But how do we know that anything exists except our own perceptions , and what we directly perceive ? How do we know that there are any other people , who have perceptions in some respects similar to our own ? I believe that these two questions express very exactly the nature of the problem which it is my chief object , in this paper , to discuss . When I say these words to you , they will at once suggest to your minds the very question , to which I desire to find an answer; they will convey to you the very same meaning which I have before my mind , when I use the words . You will understand at once what question it is that I mean to ask . But , for all that , the words which I have used are highly ambiguous . If you begin to ask yourselves what I do mean by them , you will find that there are several quite different things which I might mean . And there is , I think , great danger of confusing these different meanings with one another . I think that philosophers , when they have asked this question in one sense , have often answered it in quite a different sense; and yet have supposed that the answer which they have given is an answer to the very same question which they originally asked . It is precisely because there is this ambiguity--this danger of confusion , in the words which I have used , that I have chosen to use them . I wish to point out as clearly as I can , not only what I do mean by them , but also some things which I do not mean; and I wish to make it clear that the questions which I do not mean to ask , are different questions from that which I do mean to ask . I will take the second of my two questions , since there is in the other an additional ambiguity to which I do not now wish to call attention . My second question was: How do we know that there exist any other people who have perceptions in some respects similar to our own ? What does this question mean ?  Now I think you may have noticed that when you make a statement to another person , and he answers "How do you know that that is so ?" he very often means to suggest that you do not know it . And yet , though he means to suggest that you do not know it , he may not for a moment wish to suggest that you do not believe it , nor even that you have not that degree or kind of conviction , which goes beyond mere belief , and which may be taken to be essential to anything which can properly be called knowledge . He does not mean to suggest for a moment that you are saying something which you do not believe to be true , or even that you are not thoroughly convinced of its truth . What he does mean to suggest is that what you asserted was not true , even though you may not only have believed it but felt sure that it was true . He suggests that you don't know it , in the sense that what you believe or feel sure of is not true .  Now I point this out , not because I myself mean to suggest that we don't know the existence of other persons , but merely in order to show that the word "know" is sometimes used in a sense in which it is not merely equivalent to "believe" or "feel sure of ." When the question "How do you know that ?" is asked , the questioner does not merely mean to ask "how do you come to believe that , or to be convinced of it ?" He sometimes , and I think generally , means to ask a question with regard to the truth , and not with regard to the existence of your belief . And similarly when I ask the question "How do we know that other people exist ?" I do not mean to ask "How do we come to believe in or be convinced of their existence ?" I do not intend to discuss this question at all . I shall not ask what suggests to us our belief in the existence of other persons or of an external world; I shall not ask whether we arrive at it by inference or by "instinct" or in any other manner , which ever has been or may be suggested: I shall discuss no question of any kind whatever with regard to its origin , or cause , or the way in which it arises . These psychological questions are not what I propose to discuss . When I ask the question "How do we know that other people exist ?" I do not mean:  "How does our belief in their existence arise ?"  But if I do not mean this what do I mean P I have said that I mean to ask a question with regard to the truth of that belief; and the particular question which I mean to ask might be expressed in the words: What reason have we for our belief in the existence of other persons ? But these are words which themselves need some explanation , and I will try to give it .  In the first place , then , when I talk of "a reason ," I mean only a good reason and not a bad one . A bad reason is , no doubt , a reason , in one sense of the word; but I mean to use the word "reason" exclusively in the sense in which it is equivalent to "good reason ." But what , then , is meant by a good reason for a belief ? I think I can express sufficiently accurately what I mean by it in this connection , as follows:--A good reason for a belief is a proposition which is true , and which would not be true unless the belief were also true . We should , I think , commonly say that when a man knows such a proposition , he has a good reason for his belief; and , when he knows no such proposition , we should say that he has no reason for it . When he knows such a proposition , we should say he knows something which is a reason for thinking his belief to be true--something from which it could be validly inferred . And if , in answer to the question "How do you know so and so ?" he were to state such a proposition , we should , I think , feel that he had answered the question which we meant to ask . Suppose , for instance , in answer to the question "How do you know that ?" he were to say "I saw it in the Times ." Then , if we believed that he had seen it in the Times , and also believed that it would not have been in the Times , unless it had been true , we should admit that he had answered our question . We should no longer doubt that he did know what he asserted , we should no longer doubt that his belief was true . But if , on the other hand , we believed that he had not seen it in the Times--if , for instance , we had reason to believe that what he saw was not the statement which he made , but some other statement which he mistook for it; or if we believed that the kind of statement in question was one with regard to which there was no presumption that , being in the Times , it would be true: in either of these cases we should , I think , feel that he had not answered our question . We should still doubt whether what he had said was true . We should still doubt whether he knew what he asserted; and since a man cannot tell you how he knows a thing unless he does know that thing , we should think that , though he might have told us truly how he came to believe it , he had certainly not told us how he knew it . But though we should thus hold that he had not told us how he knew what he had asserted , and that he had given us no reason for believing it to be true; we must yet admit that he had given us a reason in a sense--a bad reason , a reason which was no reason because it had no tendency to show that what he believed was true; and we might also be perfectly convinced that he had given us the reason why he believed it--the proposition by believing which he was induced also to believe his original assertion .  I mean , then , by my question , "How do we know that other people exist ?" what , I believe , is ordinarily meant , namely , "What reason have we for believing that they exist ?" and by this again I mean , what I also believe is ordinarily meant , namely , "What proposition do we believe , which is both true itself and is also such that it would not be true , unless other people existed ?" And I hope it is plain that this question , thus explained , is quite a different question from the psychological question , which I said I did not mean to ask--from the question , "How does our belief in the existence of other people arise ?" My illustration , I hope , has made this plain . For I have pointed out that we may quite well hold that a man has told us how a belief of his arises , and even what was the reason which made him adopt that belief , and yet may have failed to give us any good reason for his belief--any proposition which is both true itself , and also such that the truth of his belief follows from it . And , indeed , it is plain that if any one ever believes what is false , he is believing something for which there is no good reason , in the sense which I have explained , and for which , therefore , he cannot possibly have a good reason; and yet it plainly does not follow that his belief did not arise in anyway whatever , nor even that he had no reason for it--no bad reason . It is plain that false beliefs do arise in some way or other--they have origins and causes: and many people who hold them have bad reasons for holding them--their belief does arise (by inference or otherwise) from their belief in some other proposition , which is not itself true , or else is not a good reason for holding that , which they infer from it , or which , in some other way , it induces them to believe . I submit , therefore , that the question , "What good reason have we for believing in the existence of other people ?" is different from the question , "How does that belief arise ?" But when I say this , I must not be misunderstood; I must not be understood to affirm that the answer to both questions may not , in a sense , be the same . I fully admit that the very same fact , which suggests to us the belief in the existence of other people , may also be a good reason for believing that they do exist . All that I maintain is that the question whether it is a good reason for that belief is a different question from the question whether it suggests that belief: if we assert that a certain fact both suggests our belief in the existence of other persons and is also a good reason for holding that belief , we are asserting two different things and not one only . And hence , when I assert , as I shall assert , that we have a good reason for our belief in the existence of other persons , I must not be understood also to assert either that we infer the existence of other persons from this good reason , or that our belief in that good reason suggests our belief in the existence of other persons in any other way . It is plain , I think , that a man may believe two true propositions , of which the one would not be true , unless the other were true too , without , in any sense whatever , having arrived at his belief in the one from his belief in the other; and it is plain , at all events , that the question whether his belief in the one did arise from his belief in the other , is a different question from the question whether the truth of the one belief follows from the truth of the other .  I hope , then , that I have made it a little clearer what I mean by the question: "What reason have we for believing in the existence of other people ?" and that what I mean by it is at all events different from what is meant by the question: "How does our belief in the existence of other people arise ?"  But I am sorry to say that I have not yet reached the end of my explanations as to what my meaning is . I am afraid that the subject may seem very tedious . I can assure you that I have found it excessively tedious to try to make my meaning clear to myself . I have constantly found that I was confusing one question with another , and that , where I had thought I had a good reason for some assertion , I had in reality no good reason . But I may perhaps remind you that this question , "How do we know so and so ?" "What reason have we for believing it ?" is one of which philosophy is full; and one to which the most various answers have been given . Philosophy largely consists in giving reasons; and the question what are good reasons for a particular conclusion and what are bad , is one upon which philosophers have disagreed as much as on any other question . For one and the same conclusion different philosophers have given not only different , but incompatible , reasons; and conversely different philosophers have maintained that one and the same fact is a reason for incompatible conclusions . We are apt , I think , sometimes to pay too little attention to this fact . When we have taken , perhaps , no little pains to assure ourselves that our own reasoning is correct , and especially when we know that a great many other philosophers agree with us , we are apt to assume that the arguments of those philosophers , who have come to a contradictory conclusion , are scarcely worthy of serious consideration . And yet , I think , there is scarcely a single reasoned conclusion in philosophy , as to which we shall not find that some other philosopher , who has , so far as we know , bestowed equal pains on his reasoning , and with equal ability , has reached a conclusion incompatible with ours . We may be satisfied that we are right , and we may , in fact , be so; but it is certain that both cannot be right: either our opponent or we must have mistaken bad reasons for good . And this being so , however satisfied we may be that it is not we who have done so , I think we should at least draw the conclusion that it is by no means easy to avoid mistaking bad reasons for good; and that no process , however laborious , which is in the least likely to help us in avoiding this should be evaded . But it is at least possible that one source of error lies in mistaking one kind of reason for another--in supposing that , because there is , in one sense , a reason for a given conclusion , there is also a reason in another , or that because there is , in one sense , no reason for a given conclusion , there is , therefore , no reason at all . I believe myself that this is a very frequent source of error: but it is at least a possible one . And where , as disagreements show , there certainly is error on one side or the other , and reason , too , to suppose that the error is not easy to detect , I think we should spare no pains in investigating any source , from which it is even possible that the error may arise . For these reasons I think I am perhaps doing right in trying to explain as clearly as possible not only what reasons we have for believing in an external world , but also in what sense I take them to be reasons .  I proceed , then with my explanation . And there is one thing , which , I think my illustration has shown that I do not mean . I have defined a reason for a belief as a true proposition , which would not be true unless the belief itself--what is believed--were also true; and I have used , as synonymous with this form of words , the expressions: A reason for a belief is a true proposition from which the truth of the belief follows from which it could be validly inferred . Now these expressions might suggest the idea that I mean to restrict the word "reason ," to what , in the strictest sense , might be called a logical reason--to propositions from which the belief in question follows , according to the rules of inference accepted by Formal Logic . But I am not using the words "follow ," "validly inferred ," in this narrow sense; I do not mean to restrict the words "reason for a belief" to propositions from which the laws of Formal Logic state that the belief could be deduced . The illustration which I gave is inconsistent with this restricted meaning . I said that the fact that a statement appeared in the Times might be a good reason for believing that that statement was true . And I am using the word "reason" in the wide and popular sense , in which it really might be . If , for instance , the Times stated that the King was dead , we should think that was a good reason for believing that the King was dead; we should think that the Times would not have made such a statement as that unless the King really were dead . We should , indeed , not think that the statement in the Times rendered it absolutely certain that the King was dead . But it is extremely unlikely that the Times would make a statement of this kind unless it were true; and , in that sense , the fact of the statement appearing in the Times would render it highly probable--much more likely than not--that the King was dead . And I wish it to be understood that I am using the words "reason for a belief" in this extremely wide sense . When I look for a good reason for our belief in the existence of other people , I shall not reject any proposition merely on the ground that it only renders their existence probable--only shows it to be more likely than not that they exist . Provided that the proposition in question does render it positively probable that they exist , then , if it also conforms to the conditions which I am about to mention , I shall call it a "good reason ."  But it is not every proposition which renders it probable that other people exist , which I shall consider to be a good answer to my question . I have just explained that my meaning is wide in one direction--in admitting some propositions which render a belief merely probable; but I have now to explain that it is restricted in two other directions . I do mean to exclude certain propositions which do render that belief probable . When I ask: What reason have we for believing in the existence of other people ? a certain ambiguity is introduced by the use of the plural "we ." If each of several different persons has a reason for believing that he himself exists , then it is not merely probable , but certain , according to the rules of Formal Logic , that , in a sense , they "have a reason for believing" that several people exist; each has a reason for believing that he himself exists; and , therefore , all of them , taken together , have reasons for supposing that several persons exist . If , therefore , I were asking the question: What reason have we for believing in the existence of other persons ? in this sense , it would follow that if each of us has a reason for believing in his own existence , these reasons , taken together , would be a reason for believing in the existence of all of us . But I am not asking the question in this sense: it is plain that this is not its natural sense . What I do mean to ask is: Does each single one of us know any proposition , which is a reason for believing that others exist ? I am using "we ," that is to say , in the sense of "each of us ." But again I do mean each of us: I am not merely asking whether some one man knows a proposition which is a reason for believing that other men exist . It would be possible that some one man , or some few men , should know such a proposition , and yet the rest know no such proposition . But I am not asking whether this is the case . I am asking whether among propositions of the kind which (as we commonly suppose) all or almost all men know , there is any which is a reason for supposing that other men exist . And in asking this question I am not begging the question by supposing that all men do exist . My question might , I think , be put quite accurately as follows . There are certain kinds of belief which , as we commonly suppose , all or almost all men share . I describe this kind of belief as "our" beliefs , simply as an easy way of pointing out which kind of belief I mean , but without assuming that all men do share them . And I then ask: Supposing a single man to have beliefs of this kind , which among them would be a good reason for supposing that other men existed having like beliefs ?  This , then , is the first restriction which I put upon the meaning of my question . And it is , I think , a restriction which , in their natural meaning , the words suggest . When we ask: What reason have we for believing that other people exist ? we naturally understand that question to be equivalent to: What reason has each of us for that belief ? And this question again is naturally equivalent to the question: Which among the propositions that a single man believes , but which are of the kind which (rightly or wrongly) we assume all men to believe , are such that they would not be true unless some other person than that man existed ? But there is another restriction which , I think , the words of my question also naturally suggest . If we were to ask anyone the question: How do you know that you did see that statement in the Times ? and he were to answer "Because I did see it in the Times and in the Standard too ," we should not think that he had given us a reason for the belief that he saw it in the Times . We should not think his answer a reason , because it asserts the very thing for which we require a reason . And similarly when I ask: How do we know that any thing or person exists , other than ourselves and what we directly perceive ? What reason have we for believing this ? I must naturally be understood to mean: What proposition , other than one which itself asserts or presupposes the existence of something beyond ourselves and our own perceptions , is a reason for supposing that such a thing exists ? And this restriction obviously excludes an immense number of propositions of a kind which all of us do believe . We all of us believe an immense number of different propositions about the existence of things which we do not directly perceive , and many of these propositions are , in my sense , good reasons for believing in the existence of still other things . The belief in the existence of a statement in the Times , when we have not seen that statement , may , as I implied , be a good reason for believing that someone is dead . But no such proposition can be a good answer to my question , because it asserts the very kind of thing for which I require a reason: it asserts the existence of something other than myself and what I directly perceive . When I am asking: What reason have I for believing in the existence of anything but myself , my own perceptions , and what I do directly perceive ? you would naturally understand me to mean: What reason , other than the existence of such a thing , have I for this belief ?  Each of us , then , we commonly assume , believes some true propositions , which do not themselves assert the existence of anything other than himself , his own perceptions , or what he directly perceives . Each of us , for instance , believes that he himself has and has had certain particular perceptions: and these propositions are propositions of the kind I mean--propositions which do not themselves assert the existence of anything other than himself , his own perceptions , and what he directly perceives: they are , I think , by no means the only propositions of this kind , which most of us believe: but they are propositions of this kind . But , as I say , I am not assuming that each of us--each of several different people--does believe propositions of this kind . All that I assume is that at least one man does believe some such propositions . And then I ask: Which among those true propositions , which one man believes , are such that they would probably not be true , unless some other man existed and had certain particular perceptions ? Which among them are such that it follows (in the wide sense , which I have explained) from their truth , that it is more likely than not that some other man has perceptions ? This is the meaning of my question , so far as I have hitherto explained it: and I hope this meaning is quite clear . It is in this sense that I am asking: What reason have we for believing that other people exist ? How do we know that they exist ? This , indeed , is not all that I mean by that question: there is one other point--the most important one--which remains to be explained . But this is part of what I mean to ask; and before I go on to explain what else I mean , I wish first to stop and enquire what is the answer to this part of my question . What is the answer to the question: Which among the true propositions , of a kind which (as we commonly assume) each of us believes , and which do not themselves assert the existence of anything other than that person himself , his own perceptions , or what he directly perceives , are such that they would probably not be true unless some other person existed , who had perceptions in some respects similar to his own ?  Now to this question the answer is very obvious . It is very obvious that in this sense we have reasons for believing in the existence of other persons , and also what some of those reasons are . But I wish to make it quite plain that this is so: that in this sense one man has a reason for believing that another has certain perceptions . All that I am asking you to grant , is , you see , that some of you would not be having just those perceptions which you now have , unless I , as I read this paper , were perceiving more or less black marks on a more or less white ground; or that I on the other hand , should not be having just those perceptions which I now have , unless some other persons than myself were hearing the sounds of my voice . And I am not asking you even to grant that this is certain--only that it is positively probable--more likely than not . Surely it is very obvious that this proposition is true . But I wish to make it quite clear what would be the consequences of denying that any such propositions are true--propositions which assert that the existence of certain perceptions in one man are a reason for believing in the existence of certain perceptions in another man--which assert that one man would probably not have had just those perceptions which he did have , unless some other man had had certain particular perceptions . It is plain , I think , that , unless some such propositions are true , we have no more reason for supposing that Alexander the Great ever saw an elephant , than for supposing that Sindbad the Sailor saw a Roc; we have no more reason for supposing that anybody saw Julius Caesar murdered in the Senate House at Rome , than for supposing that somebody saw him carried up to Heaven in a fiery chariot . It is plain , I think , that if we have any reason at all for supposing that in all probability Alexander the Great did see an elephant , and that in all probability no such person as Sindbad the Sailor ever saw a Roc , part of that reason consists in the assumption that some other person would probably not have had just those perceptions which he did have , unless Alexander the Great had seen an elephant , and unless Sindbad the Sailor had not seen a Roc . And most philosophers , I think , are willing to admit that we have some reason , in some sense or other , for such propositions as these . They are willing to admit not only that some persons probably did see Julius Caesar murdered in the Senate House; but also that some persons , other than those who saw it , had and have some reason for supposing that some one else probably saw it . Some sceptical philosophers might , indeed , deny both propositions; and to refute their views , I admit , other arguments are needed than any which I shall bring forward in this paper . But most philosophers will , I think , admit not only that facts , for which there is , as we say , good historical evidence , are probably true; but also that what we call good historical evidence really is in some sense a good reason for thinking them true . Accordingly I am going to assume that many propositions of the following kind are true . Propositions , namely , which assert that one man would probably not have certain perceptions which he does have , unless some other man had certain particular perceptions . That some of you , for instance , would probably not be having precisely the perceptions which you are having , unless I were having the perception of more or less black marks on a more or less white ground . And , in this sense , I say , we certainly have reasons for supposing that other people have perceptions similar , in some respects , to those which we sometimes have .  But when I said I was going to ask the question: What reason have we for supposing that other people exist ? you will certainly not have thought that I merely meant to ask the question which I have just answered . My words will have suggested to you something much more important than merely this . When , for instance , I said that to the question "How do you know that ?" the answer "I saw it in the Times" would be a satisfactory answer , you may have felt , as I felt , that it would not in all circumstances be regarded as such . The person who asked the question might , in some cases , fairly reply: "That is no answer: how do you know that , because you saw a thing in the Times , it is therefore true ?" In other words he might ask fora reason for supposing that the occurrence of a particular statement in the Times was a reason for supposing that statement true . And this is a question to which we all believe that there may be an answer . We believe that , with some kinds of statements which the Times makes--some kinds of statements with regard to Fiscal Policy for example--the fact that the Times makes them is no reason for supposing them to be true: whereas with regard to other kinds of statements , which it makes , such a statement , for instance , as that the King was dead , the fact that it makes them is a reason for supposing them true . We believe that there are some kinds of statements , which it is very unlikely the Times would make , unless they were true; and others which it is not at all unlikely that the Times might make , although they were not true . And we believe that a reason might be given for distinguishing , in this way , between the two different kinds of statement: for thinking that , in some cases (on points , for instance , which , as we should say , are not simple questions of fact) the Times is fallible , whereas in other cases , it is , though not absolutely infallible , very unlikely to state what is not true .  Now it is precisely in this further sense that I wish to consider: what reason have we for believing that certain particular things , other than ourselves , our own perceptions , and what we directly perceive , are real ? I have asserted that I do have certain perceptions , which it is very unlikely I should have , unless some other person had certain particular perceptions; that , for instance , it is very unlikely I should be having precisely those perceptions which I am now having unless someone else were hearing the sound of my voice . And I now wish to ask: What reason have I for supposing that this is unlikely ? What reason has any of us for supposing that any such proposition is true ? And I mean by "having a reason" precisely what I formerly meant . I mean: What other proposition do I know , which would not be true , unless my perception were connected with someone else's perception , in the manner in which I asserted them to be connected ? Here again I am asking for a good reason; and am not asking a psychological question with regard to origin . Here again I am not asking for a reason , in the strict sense of Formal Logic; I am merely asking for a proposition which would probably not be true , unless what I asserted were true . Here again I am asking for some proposition of a kind which each of us believes; I am asking: What reason has each of us for believing that some of his perceptions are connected with particular perceptions of other people in the manner I asserted ?--for believing that he would not have certain perceptions that he does have , unless some other person had certain particular perceptions ? And here again I am asking for a reason--I am asking for some proposition other than one which itself asserts: When one man has a perception of such and such a particular kind , it is probable that another man has a perception or thought of this or that other kind .  But what kind of reason can be given for believing a proposition of this sort ? For believing a proposition which asserts that , since one particular thing exists , it is probable that another particular thing also exists ? One thing I think is plain , namely that we can have no good reason for believing such a proposition , unless we have good reason for believing some generalisation . It is commonly believed , for instance , that certain so-called flint arrow-heads , which have been discovered , were probably made by prehistoric men; and I think it is plain that we have no reason for believing this unless we have reason to suppose that objects which resemble these in certain particular respects are generally made by men--are more often made by men than by any other agency . Unless certain particular characteristics which those arrow-heads have were characteristics which belonged at least more frequently to articles of human manufacture than to any articles not made by men , it would surely be just as likely as not that these arrowheads were not made by men--that they were , in fact not arrow-heads . That is to say , unless we have reason to assert a generalisation--the generalisation that objects of a certain kind are generally made by men , we have no reason to suppose that these particular objects , which are of the kind in question , were made by men . And the same , so far as I can see , is true universally . If we ever have any reason for asserting that , since one particular thing exists , another probably exists or existed or will exist also part of our reason , at least , must consist in reasons for asserting some generalisation--for asserting that the existence of things of a particular kind is , more often than not , accompanied or preceded or followed by the existence of things of another particular kind . It is , I think , sometimes assumed that an alternative to this theory may be found in the theory that the existence of one kind of thing "intrinsically points to ," or is "intrinsically a sign or symbol of" the existence of another thing . It is suggested that when a thing which thus points to the existence of another thing exists , then it is at least probable that the thing "pointed to" exists also . But this theory , I think , offers no real alternative . For , in the first place , when we say that the existence of one thing A is a "sign of" or "points to" the existence of another thing B , we very commonly actually mean to say that when a thing like A exists , a thing like B generally exists too . We may , no doubt , mean something else too; but this we do mean . We say , for instance , that certain particular words , which we hear or read , are a "sign" that somebody has thought of the particular things which we call the meaning of those words . But we should certainly hesitate to admit that the hearing or reading of certain words could be called a "sign" of the existence of certain thoughts , unless it were true that when those words are heard or read , the thoughts in question generally have existed . If when those words were heard or read , the thoughts had generally not existed , we should say that , in one sense of the word at all events , the hearing of the words was not a sign of the existence of the thoughts . In this sense , therefore , to say that the existence of A "points to" or "is a sign of" the existence of B is actually to say that when A exists , B generally exists also . But , no doubt , the words "points to" "is a sign of" may be used in some other sense: they may , for instance , mean only that the existence of A suggests in some way the belief that B exists . And in such a case we certainly might know that the existence of A pointed to the existence of B , without knowing that when A existed B generally existed also . Let us suppose , then , that in some such sense A does "point to" the existence of B; can this fact give us a reason for supposing it even probable that B existed . Certainly it can , provided it is true that when A does point to the existence of B , B generally exists . But surely it can do so , only on this condition . If when A points to the existence of B , B , nevertheless , does not generally exist , then surely the fact that A points to the existence of B can constitute no probability that B does not exist: on the contrary it will then be probable that , even though A "points to" the existence of B , B does not exist . We have , in fact , only substituted the generalisation that A's pointing to B is generally accompanied by the existence of B , for the generalisation that A's existence is generally accompanied by the existence of B . If we are to have any reason for asserting that , when A points to or is a sign of the existence of B , B probably exists , we must still have a reason for some generalisation--for a generalisation which asserts that when one thing points to the existence of another , that other generally exists .  It is plain , then , I think , that if we are to find a reason for the assertion that some particular perception of mine would probably not exist , unless someone else were having or had had a perception of a kind which I can name , we must find a reason for some generalisation . And it is also plain , I think , that in many cases of this kind the generalisation must consist in an assertion that when one man has a certain kind of perception , some other man generally has had some other perception or belief . We assume , for instance , that when we hear or read certain words , somebody besides ourselves has thought the thoughts , which constitute the meaning of those words; and it is plain , I think , that we have no reason for this assumption except one which is also a reason for the assumption that when certain words are heard or read , somebody generally has had certain thoughts . And my enquiry , therefore , at least includes the enquiry: What reasons have we for such generalisations as these ? for generalisations which assert a connection between the existence of a certain kind of perception in one man , and that of a certain kind of perception or belief in another man ?  And to this question , I think , but one answer can be given . If we have any reason for such generalisations at all , some reason must be given , in one way or another , by observation--by observation , understood in the wide sense in which it includes "experiment ." No philosopher , I think , has ever failed to assume that observation does give a reason for some generalisations--for some propositions which assert that when one kind of thing exists , another generally exists or has existed in a certain relation to it . Even those who , like Hume , imply that observation cannot give a reason for anything , yet constantly appeal to observation in support of generalisations of their own . And even those who hold that observation can give no reason for any generalisation about the relation of one man's perceptions to another's , yet hold that it can give a reason for generalisations about the relation of some to others among a man's own perceptions . It is , indeed , by no means agreed how observation can give a reason for any generalisation . Nobody knows what reason we have , if we have any , for supposing that it can . But that it can , everyone , I think , assumes . I think , therefore , most philosophers will agree , that if we can find any reason at all for generalisations of the kind in which I am interested , a reason for some of them at all events must be found in observation . And what I propose to ask is: What reason can be found in observation for even a single proposition of the kind I have described ? for a proposition which asserts that when one man has one kind of perception , another man generally has or has had another .  But , when it is said that observation gives us a reason for generalisations , two things may be meant neither of which I mean . In the first place , we popularly use "observation" in a sense in which we can be said to observe the perceptions , feelings and thoughts of other people: in which , therefore , we can be said to observe the very things with regard to which I am asking what reason we have for believing in their existence . But it is universally[1] agreed that there is a sense in which no man can observe the perceptions , feelings or thoughts of any other man . And it is to this strict sense that I propose to confine the word . I shall use it in a sense , in which we can certainly be said to observe nothing but ourselves , our own perceptions , thoughts and feelings , and what we directly perceive . And in the second place , it may be said that observations made by another person may give me a reason for believing some generalisation . And it is certainly the case that for many of the generalisations in which we all believe , if we have a reason in observation at all , it is not in our own observation that we have it: part of our reason , at all events , lies in things which other people have observed but which we ourselves have not observed . But in asking this particular question , I am not asking for reasons of this sort . The very question that I am asking is: What reason has any one of us for supposing that any other person whatever has ever made any observations ? And just as , in the first meaning which I gave to this question , it meant: What thing , that any single man observes is such that it would probably not have existed , unless some other man had made a particular observation ? So now I am asking: Which among the things , which one single man observes , are such that they would probably not have existed , unless it were true that some of them generally stood in certain relations to observations of some other person ? I am asking: Which among my own observations give me a reason for supposing that some of them are of a kind which are generally preceded or accompanied by observations of other people ? Which , for instance , among my own observations give a good reason for the generalisation that when I hear certain words , somebody else has generally had certain particular thoughts , or that whenever anyone hears certain words , somebody else has generally had the thoughts which constitute what we call the meaning of those words ? I am asking: Which among the vast series of observations , which any one individual makes during his lifetime , give a good reason for any generalisation whatever of this kind--a generalisation which asserts that some of them are generally preceded by certain thoughts , perceptions or feelings in other persons ? I quite admit that there are some generalisations of this kind for which the observations of some particular men will not give a reason . All that I ask is: Is there even one generalisation of this kind , for which the kind of observations , which (as we commonly assume) each man , or nearly every man does make , do give a reason ? Among observations of the kind which (as we commonly assume) are common to you and to me , do yours , by themselves , give any reason for even one such generalisation ? And do mine , by themselves , give any reason for even one such generalisation ? And if they do , which , among these observations , is it which do so ?  My question is , then: What reason do my own observations give me , for supposing that any perception whatever , which I have , would probably not occur , unless some other person had a certain kind of perception ? What reason do my own observations give me for supposing , for instance , that I should not be perceiving what I do now perceive , unless someone were hearing the sound of my voice ? What reason do your own observations give you for supposing that you would not be perceiving just what you are perceiving , unless I were perceiving more or less black marks on a more or less white ground ? The question does , I think , appear to be a reasonable one; and most philosophers , I think , have assumed that there is an answer to it . Yet it may be said that there is no answer to it: that my own observations give me no reason whatever for any single proposition of this kind . There are certain philosophers (even apart from thorough sceptics , with whom , as I have said , I am not now arguing) who have denied that they do . There are certain philosophers who hold that nothing which any single one of us observes or can observe , gives the slightest reason for supposing that any of his own perceptions are generally connected with certain perceptions in other people . There are philosophers who hold that the only generalisations for which our own observations do give any warrant are generalisations concerning the manner in which our own perceptions , thoughts and feelings do and probably will succeed one another; and who conclude that , this being so , we have no reason whatever for believing in the existence of any other people . And these philosophers are , I think , right in drawing this conclusion from this premiss . It does not , indeed , follow from their premiss that we have not a reason in the sense which I first explained , and in which , I insisted , it must be admitted that we have a reason . It does not follow that some of our perceptions are not such as would probably not exist , unless some other person had certain perceptions . But , as I have urged , when we say that we have a reason for asserting the existence of something not perceived , we commonly mean something more than this . We mean not only that , since what we perceive does exist , the unperceived thing probably exists too; we mean also that we have some reason for asserting this connection between the perceived and the unperceived . And holding , as we do , that no reason can be given for asserting such a connection , except observation , we should say that , if observation gives no reason for asserting it , we have no reason for asserting it; and having no reason for asserting this connection between the perceived and the unperceived , we should say that we have none either for asserting the even probable existence of the unperceived . This , I think , is what we commonly mean by saying that we have no reason to believe in the existence of a particular thing which we do not perceive . And hence , I think , those philosophers who hold that our own observations give us no reason whatever for any generalisation whatever concerning the connection of any of them with those of other people , are quite right in concluding that we have no reason to assert that any other person ever did have any particular thought or perception whatever . I think that the words of this conclusion , understood in their natural meaning , express precisely what the premiss asserts . We need not , indeed , conclude , as many of these philosophers are inclined to do , that , because we have no reason for believing in the existence of other people , it is therefore highly doubtful whether they do exist . The philosophers who advocate this opinion commonly refute themselves by assigning the existence of other people as part of their reason for believing that it is very doubtful whether any other people exist . That for which we have no reason may , nevertheless , be certainly true . And , indeed , one of the philosophers who hold most clearly and expressly that we do know not only the existence of other people but also that of material objects , is also one of those who deny most emphatically that our own observations can give any reason for believing either in the one or in the other . I refer to Thomas Reid . Reid , indeed , allows himself to use not only the word "observe ," but even the word "perceive ," in that wide sense in which it might be said that we observe or perceive the thoughts and feelings of others: and I think that the fact that he uses the words in this sense , has misled him into thinking that his view is more plausible and more in accordance with Common Sense than it really is: by using the words in this sense he is able to plead that "observation" really does give a reason for some of those generalisations , for which Common Sense holds that "observation" (in a narrower sense) does give a reason . But with regard to what we observe or perceive , in the strict sense to which 1 am confining those words , he asserts quite explicitly that it gives us no reason either for believing in the existence of material objects or for believing in the existence of other minds . Berkeley , he says , has proved incontrovertibly that it gives us no reason for the one , and Hume that it gives us no reason for the other .  Now these philosophers may be right in holding this . It may , perhaps , be true that , in this sense , my own observations give me no reason whatever for believing that any other person ever has or will perceive anything like or unlike what I perceive . But I think it is desirable we should realise how paradoxical are the consequences which must be admitted , if this is true . It must then be admitted that the very large part of our knowledge , which we suppose to have some basis in experience , is by no means based upon experience , in the sense , and to the extent , which we suppose . We do for instance , commonly suppose that there is some basis in experience for the assertion that some people , whom we call Germans , use one set of words to express much the same meaning which we express by using a different set of words . But , if this view be correct , we must admit that no person's experience gives him any reason whatever for supposing that , when he hears certain words , any one else has ever heard or thought of the same words , or meant anything by them . The view admits , indeed , that I do know that when I hear certain words , somebody else has generally had thoughts more or less similar to those which I suppose him to have had: but it denies that my own observations could ever give me the least reason for supposing that this is so . It admits that my own observations may give me reason for supposing that if anyone has ever had perceptions like mine in some respects , he will also have had other perceptions like others of mine: but it denies that they give me any reason for supposing that any one else has had a perception like one of mine . It admits that my own observations may give me reason for supposing that certain perceptions and thoughts in one person (if they exist) will be followed or preceded by certain other perceptions and thoughts in that person: but it denies that they give me any reason whatever for any similar generalisation concerning the connection of a certain kind of perception in one person with a certain kind of perception in another . It admits that I should not have certain perceptions , which I do have , unless someone else had had certain other perceptions; but it denies that my own observations can give me any reason for saying so--for saying that I should not have had this perception , unless someone else had had that . No observations of mine , it holds , can ever render it probable that such a generalisation is true; no observation of mine can ever confirm or verify such a generalisation . If we are to say that any such generalisation whatever is based upon observation , we can only mean , what Reid means , that it is based on a series of assumptions . When I observe this particular thing , I assume that that particular thing , which I do not observe , exists; when I observe another particular thing , I again assume that a second particular thing , which I do not observe , exists; when I observe a third particular thing , I again assume that a third particular thing , which I do not observe , exists . These assumed facts--the assumed fact that one observation of mine is accompanied by the existence of one particular kind of thing , and that another observation of mine is accompanied by the existence of a different particular kind of thing , will then give me a reason for different generalisations concerning the connection of different perceptions of mine with different external objects--objects which I do not perceive . But (it is maintained) nothing but a mass of such assumptions will give me a reason for any such generalisation .  Now I think it must be admitted that there is something paradoxical in such a view . I think it may be admitted that , in holding it , the philosopher of Common Sense departs from Common Sense at least as far in one direction as his opponents had done in another . But I think that there is some excuse for those who hold it: I think that , in one respect , they are more in the right than those who do not hold it--than those who hold that my own observations do give me a reason for believing in the existence of other people . For those who hold that my observations do give me a reason , have , I believe , universally supposed that the reason lies in a part of my observations , in which no such reason is to be found . This is why I have chosen to ask the question: What reason do my observations give me for believing that any other person has any particular perceptions or beliefs ? I wish to consider which among the things which I observe will give such a reason . For this is a question to which no answer , that I have ever seen , appears to me to be correct . Those who have asked it have , so far as I know , answered it either by denying that my observations give me any reason or by pointing to a part of my observations , which , as it seems to me , really do give none . Those who deny are , it seems to me , right in holding that the reason given by those who affirm is no reason . And their correct opinion on this point will , I think , partly serve to explain their denial . They have supposed that if our observations give us any reason at all for asserting the existence of other people , that reason must lie where it has been supposed to lie by those who hold that they do give a reason . And then , finding that this assigned reason is no reason , they have assumed that there is no other .  I am proposing then to ask: Which among the observations , which I make , and which (as we commonly suppose) are similar in kind to those which all or almost all men make , will give a reason for supposing that the existence of any of them is generally connected with the existence of certain kinds of perception or belief in other people ? And in order to answer this question , it is obvious we must first consider two others . We must consider , in the first place: Of what nature must observations be , if they are to give a reason for any generalisation asserting that the existence of one kind of thing is generally connected with that of another ? And we must consider in the second place: What kinds of things do we observe ?  Now to the first of these questions I am not going to attempt to give a complete answer . The question concerning the rules of Inductive Logic , which is the question at issue , is an immensely difficult and intricate question . And I am not going to attempt to say , what kind of observations are sufficient to justify a generalisation . But it is comparatively easy to point out that a certain kind of observations are necessary to justify a generalisation: and this is all that I propose to do . I wish to point out certain conditions which observations must satisfy , if they are to justify a generalisation; without in any way implying that all observations which do satisfy these conditions , will justify a generalisation . The conditions , I shall mention , are ones which are certainly not sufficient to justify a generalisation; but they are , I think , conditions , without which no generalisation can be justified . If a particular kind of observations do not satisfy these conditions , we can say with certainty that those observations give us no reason for believing in the existence of other people; though , with regard to observations which do satisfy them , we shall only be able to say that they may give a reason .  What conditions , then , must observations satisfy , if they are to justify a generalisation ? Let us suppose that the generalisation to be justified is one which asserts that the existence of a kind of object , which we will call A , is generally preceded , accompanied , or followed by the existence of a kind of object , which we call B . A , for instance , might be the hearing of a certain word by one person , and B the thought of that which we call the meaning of the word , in another person; and the generalisation to be justified might be that when one person hears a word , not spoken by himself , someone else has generally thought of the meaning of that word . What must I have observed , if the generalisation that the existence of A is generally preceded by the existence of B , is to be justified by my observations ? One first point , I think , is plain . I must have observed both some object , which is in some respects like A , and which I will call α , and also some object in some respects like B which I will call β: I must have observed both α and β , and also I must have observed β preceding α . This , at least , I must have observed . But I do not pretend to say how like α and β must be to A and B; nor do I pretend to say how often I must have observed β preceding α , although it is generally held that I must have observed this more than once . These are questions , which would have to be discussed if we were trying to discover what observations were sufficient to justify the generalisation that the existence of A is generally preceded by that of B . But I am only trying to lay down the minimum which is necessary to justify this generalisation; and therefore I am content to say that we must have observed something more or less like B preceding something more or less like A , at least once .  But there is yet another minimum condition . If my observation of β preceding α is to justify the generalisation that the existence of A is generally preceded by the existence of B , it is plain , I think , that both the β and the α , which I observed , must have existed or been real; and that also the existence of β must really have preceded that of α . It is plain that if , when I observed α and β , α existed but β did not , this observation could give me no reason to suppose that on another occasion when A existed , β would exist . Or again , if , when I observed β preceding α , both β and α existed , but the existence of β did not really precede that of α , but , on the contrary , followed it , this observation could certainly give me no reason to suppose that , in general , the existence of A was preceded by the existence of B . Indeed this condition that what is observed must have been real might be said to be included in the very meaning of the word "observation ." We should , in this connection , say that we had not observed β preceding α , unless β and α were both real , and β had really preceded α . If I say "I have observed that , on one occasion , my hearing of the word 'moon' was followed by my imagining a luminous silvery disc ," I commonly mean to include in my statement the assertion that I did , on that occasion , really hear the word "moon ," and really did have a visual image of a luminous disc , and that my perception was really followed by my imagination . If it were proved to me that this had not really happened , I should admit that I had not really observed it . But though this condition that , if observation is to give reason for a generalisation , what is observed must be real , may thus be said to be implied in the very word "observation ," it was necessary for me to mention the condition explicitly . It was necessary , because , as I shall presently show , we do and must also use the word "observation" in a sense in which the assertion "I observe A" by no means includes the assertion "A exists"--in a sense in which it may be true that though I did observe A , yet A did not exist .  But there is also , I think , a third necessary condition which is very apt to be overlooked . It may , perhaps , be allowed that observation gives some reason for the proposition that hens' eggs are generally laid by hens . I do not mean to say that any one man's observation can give a reason for this proposition: I do not assume either that it can or that it cannot . Nor do I mean to make any assumption as to what must be meant by the words "hens" and "eggs ," if this proposition is to be true . I am quite willing to allow for the moment that if it is true at all , we must understand by "hens" and "eggs ," objects very unlike that which we directly observe , when we see a hen in a yard , or an egg on the breakfast-table . I am willing to allow the possibility that , as some Idealists would say , the proposition "Hens lay eggs" is false , unless we mean by it: A certain kind of collection of spirits or monads sometimes has a certain intelligible relation to another kind of collection of spirits or monads . I am willing to allow the possibility that , as Reid and some scientists would say , the proposition "Hens lay eggs" is false , if we mean by it anything more than that: Certain configurations of invisible material particles sometimes have a certain spatio-temporal relation to another kind of configuration of invisible material particles . Or again I am willing to allow , with certain other philosophers , that we must , if it is to be true , interpret this proposition as meaning that certain kinds of sensations have to certain other kinds a relation which may be expressed by saying that the one kind of sensations "lay" the other kind . Or again , as other philosophers say , the proposition "Hens lay eggs" may possibly mean: Certain sensations of mine would , under certain conditions , have to certain other sensations of mine a relation which may be expressed by saying that the one set would "lay" the other set . But whatever the proposition "Hens' eggs are generally laid by hens" may mean , most philosophers would , I think , allow that , in some sense or other , this proposition was true . And they would also I think allow that we have some reason for it; and that part of this reason at all events lies in observation: they would allow that we should have no reason for it unless certain things had been observed , which have been observed . Few , I think , would say that the existence of an egg "intrinsically points" to that of a hen , in such a sense that , even if we had had no experience of any kind concerning the manner in which objects like eggs are connected with animals like hens , the mere inspection of an egg would justify the assertion: A hen has probably existed .  I assume , then , that objects having all the characteristics which hens' eggs have (whatever these may be) are generally laid by hens (whatever hens may be); and I assume that , if we have any reason for this generalisation at all , observation gives us some reason for it . But now , let us suppose that the only observations we had made were those which we should commonly describe by saying that we had seen a hen laying an egg . I do not say that any number of such observations , by themselves , would be sufficient to justify our generalisation: I think it is plain that they would not . But let us suppose , for the moment , that we had observed nothing else which bore upon the connection between hens and eggs; and that , if therefore our generalisation was justified by any observations at all , it was justified by these . We are supposing , then , that the observations which we describe as "seeing hens lay eggs" give some reason for the generalisation that eggs of that kind are generally laid by hens . And if these observations give reason for this , obviously in a sense they give reason for the generalisation that the existence of such an egg is generally preceded by that of a hen; and hence also , they give us reason to suppose that if such an egg exists , a hen has probably existed also--that unless a hen had existed , the egg would not have existed . But the point to which I wish to call attention is that it is only in a limited sense that they do give reason for this . They only give us reason to suppose that , for each egg , there has existed a hen , which was at some time near the place where the egg in question then was , and which existed at a time near to that at which the egg began to exist . The only kind of hens , whose existence they do give us reason to suppose , are hens , of which each was at some time in spatial and temporal proximity (or , if Idealists prefer , in the relations which are the "intelligible counterparts" of these) to an egg . They give us no information at all about the existence of hens (if there are any) which never came within a thousand miles of an egg , or which were dead a thousand years before any egg existed . That is to say , they do give us reason to suppose that , if a particular egg exists , there has probably existed a hen which was at some time near that egg; but they give us no reason to suppose that , if a particular egg exists , there must have existed a hen which never came near that egg . They do give us reason to suppose that , for each egg , there has probably existed a hen which at some time stood to the egg in question in that relation which we have observed to hold between an egg and a hen , when we observed the hen laying an egg . But they give us no reason to infer from the existence of an egg any other kind of hen: any hen which never stood to the egg in the relation in which we have observed that some hens do stand to eggs .  What I wish to suggest is that this condition is a universal condition for sound inductions . If the observation of β preceding α can ever give us any reason at all for supposing that the existence of A is generally preceded by that of B , it can at most only give us reason to suppose that the existence of an A is generally preceded by that of a B which stands to our A in the same relation in which β has been observed to stand to α . It cannot give the least reason for supposing that the existence of an A must have been preceded by that of a B , which did not stand to A in the observed relation , but in some quite different one . If we are to have any reason to infer from the existence of an A the existence of such a B , the reason must lie in some different observations . That this is so , in the case of hens' eggs and hens , is , I think , obvious: and , if the rule is not universal , some reason should at least be given for supposing that it does apply in one case and not in another .  Having thus attempted to point out some conditions which seem to be necessary , though not sufficient , where observation is to give any reason for a generalisation , I may now proceed to my second preliminary question . What kinds of things do we observe ?  In order to illustrate how much and how little I mean by "observation" or "direct perception ," I will take as an instance a very common visual perception . Most of us are familiar with the experience which we should describe by saying that we had seen a red book and a blue book side by side upon a shelf . What exactly can we be said to observe or directly perceive when we have such an experience ? We certainly observe one colour , which we call blue , and a different colour , which we call red; each of these we observe as having a particular size and shape; and we observe also these two coloured patches as having to one another the spatial relation which we express by saying they are side by side . All this we certainly see or directly perceive now , whatever may have been the process by which we have come to perceive so much . But when we say , as in ordinary talk we should , that the objects we perceive are books , we certainly mean to ascribe to them properties , which , in a sense which we all understand , are not actually seen by us , at the moment when we are merely looking at two books on a shelf two yards off . And all such properties I mean to exclude as not being then observed or directly perceived by us . When I speak of what we observe , when we see two books on a shelf , I mean to limit the expression to that which is actually seen . And , thus understood , the expression does include colours , and the size and shape of colours , and spatial relations in three dimensions between these patches of colour , but it includes nothing else .  But I am also using observation in a sense in which we can be said actually to observe a movement . We commonly say that we can sometimes see a red billiard ball moving towards a white one on a green table . And , here again , I do not mean to include in what is directly perceived or observed , all that we mean by saying that the two objects perceived are billiard-balls . But I do mean to include what (we should say) we actually see . We actually see a more or less round red patch moving towards a more or less round white patch; we see the stretch of green between them diminishing in size . And this perception is not merely the same as a series of perceptions--first a perception of a red patch with a green stretch of one size between it and the white; then a perception of a red patch with a green stretch of a different size between it and the white; and so on . In order to perceive a movement we must have a different perception from any one of these or from the sum of them . We must actually see the green stretch diminishing in size .  Now it is undoubtedly difficult , in some instances , to decide precisely what is perceived in this sense and what is not . But I hope I have said enough to show that I am using "perceive" and "observe" in a sense in which , on a given occasion , it is easy to decide that some things certainly are perceived , and other things , as certainly , are not perceived . I am using it in a sense in which we do perceive such a complex object as a white patch moving towards a red one on a green field; but I am not using it in any sense in which we could be said to "perceive" or "observe" that what we saw moving was a billiard-ball . And in the same way I think we can distinguish roughly between what , on any given occasion , we perceive , as we say , "by any one of the other senses ," and what we do not perceive by it . We can say with certainty that , on any given occasion , there are certain kinds of "content" which we are actually hearing , and others which we are not actually hearing; though with regard to some again it is difficult to say whether we are actually hearing them or not . And similarly we can distinguish with certainty in some instances , between what we are on a given occasion , actually smelling or feeling , and what we are not actually smelling or feeling .  But now , besides these kinds of "things ," "objects ," or "contents ," which we perceive , as we say , "by the senses ," there is also another kind which we can be said to observe . Not only can I observe a red and blue book side by side; I can also observe myself observing them . I can perceive a red patch moving towards a white , and I can also perceive my perception of this movement . And what I wish to make as plain as I can is that my perception of the movement of a coloured patch can at least be distinguished from that movement itself . I wish to make it plain that to observe a coloured patch moving is to observe one thing; and to observe myself observing a coloured patch moving is another . When I observe my own perception of a movement , I observe something more than when I merely observe the movement , and something very different from the movement . I may perceive a red and a blue book side by side on a shelf; and at another time I may perceive a red ball moving towards a white . The red and blue patch , of one shape , at rest side by side , are different from the red , of another shape , moving towards the white; and yet , when I say that both are "perceived ," I mean by "perceived" one and the same thing . And since , thus , two different things may both be perceived , there must also be some difference between each of them and what is meant by saying that it is perceived . Indeed , in precisely the same way In which I may observe a spatial relation between a red patch and a blue (when I observe them "side by side") I do , when I observe my own perception of them , observe a spatial relation between it and them . I observe a distance between my perception and the red and blue books which I perceive , comparable in magnitude with the breadth or height of the blue book , just as these are comparable in magnitude with one another . And when I say I observe a distance between my perception of a red book and that red book itself , I do not mean that I observe a distance between my eyes , or any other part of what I call my body , and the red patch in question . I am talking not of my eyes , but of my actual perception . I observe my perception of a book to be near the book and further from the table , in exactly the same sense in which I observe the book to be near the shelf on which it stands , and further from the table . And just as , if the distance between a red patch and a white is to be perceived , the red patch must be different from the white , so , if I perceive a certain distance between my perception and the red patch , my perception must be different from the red patch which I perceive .  I assume , then , that we observe , on the one hand , coloured patches of certain shapes and sizes , and their spatial relations to one another , together with all the other kinds of "contents ," which we should usually be said to perceive "through the senses ." And , on the other hand , we also sometimes observe our own perceptions of such "contents" and our thoughts . And these two kinds of "content" are different from one another: my perception of a red patch with gold letters on it , is not itself a red patch with gold letters on it; and hence , when I observe my perception of this patch , I observe something different from that which I observe when I merely perceive the patch . Either of these two kinds of "content"--either colours , moving or at rest , sounds , smells , and all the rest--or , on the other hand , my perceptions of these--either of these two kinds , or both , might conceivably , since both are observed , give grounds for a generalisation concerning what exists . But , as I have said , if observations are to give any ground for such a generalisation , it must be assumed that what Is observed exists or is real . And since , as I have insisted , when I observe my perception of a red patch with gold letters on it , I observe something different from what I observed when I merely observed a red patch with gold letters on it , it follows that to assume the existence of my perception of this red and gold is not the same thing as to assume the existence of the red and gold itself .  But what , it may be asked , do I mean by this property of "existence" or "reality ," which may , it would seem , belong to every content , which I observe , or may again belong to none , or which may belong to some and not to others ? What is this property which may belong to my perception of a movement , and yet not belong to the movement perceived , or which may again belong to the movement perceived and not to my perception of it , or which may again belong to both or to neither ?  It is necessary , I think , to ask this question at this point , because there are some philosophers who hold that , in the case of some kinds of "content ," at all events , to say that they "exist" is to say that they are "perceived ." Some hold that to say "A exists" is to say neither more nor less than "A is perceived"--that the two expressions are perfect synonyms; and others again would say that by "A exists or is real" we may mean more than that "A is perceived ," but that we must at least mean this . Now , I have hitherto used the word "existence" pretty freely , and I think that , when I used it , I used it in its ordinary sense . I think it will generally have suggested to you precisely what I meant to convey , and I think that , in some cases at all events , it will not even have occurred to you to doubt whether you did understand what I meant by it . But , if these philosophers are right , then , if you have understood what I meant by it , I have all along been using it in a sense , which renders the end of my last paragraph perfect nonsense . If these philosophers are right , then , when I assert that what is perceived may yet not exist , I am really asserting that what is perceived may yet not be perceived--I am contradicting myself . I am , of course , quite unaware that I am doing so . But these philosophers would say either you are contradicting yourself , or you are not using the word "exists" in its ordinary sense . And either of these alternatives would be fatal to my purpose . If I am not using the word in its ordinary sense , then I shall not be understood by anyone; and , if I am contradicting myself , then what I say will not be worth understanding .  Now , with one class of these philosophers--the class to which , I think , Berkeley belongs--I think I can put myself right comparatively easily . The philosophers I mean are those who say that it is only in the case of one particular class of "contents" (the kind of "content" which Berkeley calls "ideas") that to say "the 'content' A exists" is to say "A is perceived ," and who admit that in the case of other contents--myself and my perceptions and thoughts , for example--to say that these exist or are real , is to say of them something different from this . These philosophers admit , that is to say , that the word "exists" has two different senses: and that in only one of these senses is it synonymous with the words "is perceived ." When (they hold) I say of such a content as a red patch with gold letters on it that it "exists" I do mean that it is perceived; but when I say of my perception of such a patch that it exists , I do not mean that my perception is perceived but something different from this . Now , it would be nothing strange that one and the same word should be used in two different senses; many words are used in many different senses . But it would , I think , be something very strange indeed , if in the case of a word which we constantly apply to all sorts of different objects , we should uniformly apply it to one large class of object in the one sense and the one sense only and the other large class in the other sense and the other sense only . Usually , in the case of such ambiguous words , it happens that , in different contexts , we apply it to one and the same object in both senses . We sometimes wish to say of a given object that it has the one property , and sometimes we wish to say of the same object that it has the other property; and hence we apply the same word to the same object , at one time in one sense , and at another in the other . I think , therefore , that , even if there were these two different senses of the word "existence ," it would be very unlikely that we should not commonly , in some contexts , apply it in the sense , in which (as is alleged) it does apply to perceptions , to "contents" which are not perceptions . Indeed , I think , it is quite plain that we constantly do ask , with regard to what is not a perception , whether it exists , in precisely the same sense , in which we ask , with regard to a perception , whether it exists . We ask in precisely the same sense: Was the Roc a real bird , or merely an imaginary one ? and , did Sindbad's perception of the Roc really exist , or is it a fiction that he perceived a Roc ? I think , therefore , that the sense in which these philosophers admit that we do apply the word "existence" to perceptions , is one in which we also commonly apply it to "contents" other than perceptions . But , even if this is not the case , I can set myself right with them by a simple explanation . I need merely explain that the sense in which I am proposing to enquire whether a red patch exists , is precisely the sense in which they admit that my perception of a red patch does exist . And in this sense , it is plain that to suppose that a thing may exist , which is not perceived , or that it may not exist , although it is perceived , is at least not self-contradictory .  But there may be other philosophers who will say that , in the case of a perception also , to say that it exists or is real is to say that it is perceived--either that alone or something more as well . And to these philosophers I would first point out that they are admitting that the proposition "This perception is real" is significant . There is some sense or other in which we may say: "Alexander's perception of an elephant was real or did exist , but Sindbad's perception of a Roc was not real--never did exist": the latter proposition is , in some sense or other , not self-contradictory . And then I would ask of them: When they say , that to call a perception "real" is to assert that it is perceived , do they mean by this that to call it real is to assert that it is really perceived , or not ? If they say "No ," then they are asserting that to call a perception "real" is merely to say that it was perceived in the sense in which Sindbad did perceive a Roc: they are asserting that to call it "real" is not to say , in any sense , that it was really perceived: they are asserting that to call a perception "real" is to say that it was perceived , in some sense quite other than that in which we ordinarily use the word: for we certainly commonly mean , when we say "A was perceived ," that a perception of A was "real": we should commonly say that Sindbad did not perceive a Roc--meaning that no such perception ever did exist . I do not think they do mean this; and , in any case , if they do , I think it is plain that they are wrong . When we say that a perception is "real ," we certainly do not mean merely that it is the object of another perception , which may itself be quite unreal--purely Imaginary . I assume , therefore , that when they say: To call a perception "real" is to say that it is perceived; they mean , what we should naturally understand , namely , that: To call it "real" is to say that it is really perceived--to say that it is the object of another perception , which is also real in the same sense . And , if they mean this , then what they say is certainly untrue . Their definition of reality is circular . It cannot be the case that the only sense in which a perception may be said to be real , is one in which to call it so is to assert that not it alone , but another perception is real also . It cannot be the case that the assertion "A is real" is identical with the assertion "A and B are both real ," where A and B are different , and "real" is used in the same sense as applied to both . If it is to be true that the assertion "A is real" ever , in any sense , includes the assertion "A is really perceived ," there must be another sense of the word "real ," in which to assert "A is real" is to assert less than "A is really perceived"--the sense , namely , in which we here assert that the perception of A is real .  We find , therefore , that the other class of philosophers were at least right in this: they were right in allowing that the sense in which we commonly say that our perceptions exist is one in which "exist" does not include , even as a part of its meaning , "is perceived ." We find that there is a common sense of the word "existence ," in which to say "A exists" must mean less than "A is really perceived": since , otherwise , the only possible definition of the word "existence" would be a circular definition . And I may point out that two other definitions , which have been sometimes suggested by philosophers as giving what we commonly mean by "reality" or "existence" are vitiated by the same fault--they also are circular . Some philosophers have sometimes suggested that when we call a thing "real ," we mean that it is "systematically connected" in some way with other things . But , when we look into their meaning , we find that what they mean is (what , indeed , is alone plausible)--systematically connected with other real things . And it may possibly be the case that we sometimes use the word "real" in this sense: but , at least , it must be certainly the case , that , if we do , we also use it in another and simpler sense--the sense in which it is employed in the proposed definition . And other philosophers have suggested that what we mean by "real" is--"connected in some way with a purpose--helping or hindering , or the object of a purpose ." But if we look into their meaning , we find they mean--connected with a real purpose . And hence , even if we do sometimes mean by "real ," "connected with a real purpose ," it is plain we also sometimes mean by "real" something simpler than this--that namely , which is meant by "real" in the proposed definition .  It is certain , therefore , that we do commonly use the word "existence" in a sense , in which to say "A exists" is not to say "A is perceived ," or "A is systematically connected with other real things ," or "A is purposive ." There is a simpler sense than any of these--the sense in which we say that our own perceptions do exist , and that Sindbad's perceptions did not exist . But when I say this , I am by no means denying that what exists , in this simple sense , may not always also exist in all the others; and that what exists in any of them may not also always exist in this . It is quite possible that what exists is always also perceived , and that what is perceived always also exists . All that I am saying is that , even if this is so , this proposition is significant--is not merely a proposition about the meaning of a word . It is not self-contradictory to suppose that some things which exist are not perceived , and that some things which are perceived do not exist .  But , it may be asked: What is this common simple sense of the word "exists" ? For my own part , it seems to me to be so simple that it cannot be expressed in other words , except those which are recognised as its synonyms . I think we are all perfectly familiar with its meaning: it is the meaning which you understood me to have throughout this paper , until I began this discussion . I think we can perceive at once what is meant by asserting that my perception of black marks on a white ground is "real ," and that no such perception as Sindbad's of a Roc was ever "real": we are perfectly familiar with the property which the one perception is affirmed to possess , and the other to be without . And I think , as I have said , that this property is a simple one . But , whatever it is , this , which we ordinarily mean , is what I mean by "existence" or "reality ." And this property , we have seen , is certainly neither identical with nor inclusive of that complex one which we mean by the words "is perceived ."  I may now , then , at last approach the main question of my paper . Which among the "contents" which I observe will give me reason to suppose that my observation of some of them is generally preceded or accompanied or followed by the existence of certain particular perceptions , thoughts or feelings in another person ? I have explained that the "contents" which I actually observe may be divided into two classes: on the one hand , those which , as we commonly say , we perceive "through the senses"; and , on the other hand , my perceptions of these last , my thoughts , and my feelings . I have explained that if any of these observed contents are to give reason for a generalisation about what exists , they must exist . And I have explained that with regard to both classes of "contents" I am using the word "exist" in precisely the same sense--a sense , in which it is certainly not self-contradictory to suppose that what is perceived , does not exist , and that what is not perceived , does exist; and , in which , therefore , the assumption that a red patch with gold letters on it exists , is a different assumption from the assumption that my perception of a red patch with gold letters on it exists; and the assumption that my perception of a red patch with gold letters on it exists , is a different assumption from the assumption that a red patch with gold letters on it exists .  What , then , that we observe , can give us any reason for believing that anyone else has certain particular perceptions , thoughts or feelings ? It has , I think , been very commonly assumed that the observation of my own perceptions , thoughts , and feelings , can , by itself , give me such a reason . And I propose , therefore , to examine this assumption . If , as I hope to show , it is false; it will then follow , that if our own observation gives us any reason whatever , for believing in the existence of other persons , we must assume the existence , not only of our own perceptions , thoughts and feelings , but also of some , at least , among that other class of data , which I may now , for the sake of brevity , call "sense-contents"; we must assume that some of them exist , in precisely the same sense in which we assume that our perceptions , thoughts , and feelings exist .  The theory which I propose to examine is , then , the following . My observation of my own thoughts , feelings , and perceptions may , it asserts , give me some reason to suppose that another person has thoughts , feelings , and perceptions similar to some of mine . Let us assume , accordingly , that my own thoughts , feelings , and perceptions do exist; but that none of the "sense-contents ," which I also observe , do so . Where among my perceptions am I to look for any which might conceivably give me a reason for supposing the existence of other perceptions similar to my own ? It is obvious where I must look . I have perceptions which I call perceptions of other people's bodies; and these are certainly similar in many respects to other perceptions of my own body . But I also observe that certain kinds of perceptions of my own body are preceded by certain other perceptions , thoughts , or feelings of mine . I may , for instance , observe that when I perceive my hand suddenly catch hold of my foot in a particular way , this perception was preceded by a particular kind of feeling of pain . I may , perhaps , observe this often enough to justify the generalisation that the perception of that particular motion of my body is generally preceded by that particular feeling of pain . And in this way I may perhaps have reason for quite a number of generalisations which assert that particular kinds of perceptions of my own body are generally preceded by other particular kinds of perceptions , thoughts , or feelings of my own .  But I may also , no doubt , have the perception , which I call the perception of another person's hand catching hold of his foot , in a manner similar to that in which I have perceived my own hand catch hold of my own foot . And my perception of another person's hand catching hold of his foot may undoubtedly be similar in many respects to my perception of my own hand catching hold of my own foot . But I shall not observe the same kind of feeling of pain preceding my perception of his hand catching hold of his foot , which I have observed preceding my perception of my hand catching hold of my foot . Will my generalisation , then , give me any reason to suppose that nevertheless my perception of his hand catching hold of his foot is preceded by a similar feeling of pain , not in me but in him ? We undoubtedly do assume that when I perceive another person's body making movements similar to those which I have observed my own body making , this perception has generally been preceded by some feeling or perception of his similar to that which I have observed to precede my perception of similar movements in my own body . We do assume this; and it is precisely the kind of generalisation , which , I have insisted , must be admitted to be true . But my present question is: Will such observations as I have described give any reason for thinking any such generalisation true ? I think it is plain that they will not give the slightest reason for thinking so . In the first place , all the perceptions which I call perceptions of another person's body differ very considerably from any of those which I call perceptions of my own . But I am willing to waive this objection . I am not offering any theory as to what degree of likeness is sufficient to justify a generalisation: and therefore I will allow that the degree of likeness may be sufficient . But there remains an objection which is , I think , quite fatal to the proposed inference . This objection is that the inference in question plainly does not satisfy the third condition which I suggested above as necessary , wherever any generalisation is to be justified by observation . I am willing to allow that my observations of the fact that my perception of a certain movement in my own body is preceded by a certain feeling of pain , will justify the generalisation that my perception of any such movement , whether in my own body or in that of another person , is generally preceded by a similar feeling of pain . And I allow , therefore , that when I perceive a certain movement in another's body , it is probable that the feeling of pain exists , though I do not perceive it . But , if it is probable that such a feeling of pain exists , such a feeling must stand in the same relation to my perception of the movement in another person's body , in which a similar feeling of pain has been observed by me to stand to my perception of such a movement in my own body . That is to say the only kind of feeling of pain , which my observations do justify me in inferring , if (as I admit they may) they justify me in inferring any at all , is a feeling of pain of my own . They cannot possibly justify the belief in the existence of any such feeling except one which stands to my perception in the same relation in which my feelings do stand to my perceptions--one , that is to say , which is my own . I have no more reason to believe that the feeling of pain which probably precedes my perception of a movement in another person's body can be the feeling of another person , than , in my former example , I had reason to suppose that the hen , whose existence probably preceded that of a given egg , could be a hen , which had never been near the egg in question . The two cases are exactly analogous . I observe a feeling of pain of my own preceding a perception of my own . I observe the two , that is to say , as standing to one another , in those relations (whatever they may be) in which any perception of mine stands to any other thought , perception or feeling of mine , and which are , at all events , different from any relation in which a perception or feeling of another person can stand to one of mine . I never perceive the feeling and the perception as standing in any other relation . In any case , therefore , where I do observe something like the perception , but do not observe the feeling , I can only be justified (if justified in inferring any feeling at all) , in inferring an unperceived feeling of my own .  For this reason I think that no observations of my own perceptions , feelings or thoughts can give me the slightest reason for supposing a connection between any of them and any feeling , perception , or thought in another person . The argument is perfectly general , since all my perceptions , feelings and thoughts do have to one another those relations in virtue of which I call them mine; and which , when I talk of a perception , feeling or thought as being another persons , I mean to say that it has not got to any of mine . I can , therefore , merely from observation of this class of data never obtain the slightest reason for belief in the existence of a feeling , perception , or thought which does not stand in these relations to one of mine--which is , that is to say , the feeling , perception or thought , of another person . But how different is the case , if we adopt the hypothesis , which I wish to recommend--if we assume the existence of that other class of data which I have called "sense-contents!" On this hypothesis , that which I perceive , when I perceive a movement of my own body , is real; that which I perceive when I perceive a movement of another's body is real also . I can now observe not merely the relation between my perception of a movement of my body and my own feelings , but also a relation between a real movement of my body and my own feelings . And there is no reason why I should not be justified in inferring that another person's feelings stand in the same relation to the real movements of his body , in which I observe my own feelings to stand to similar real movements of mine .  But there is another argument which may still be urged by those who hold that my own perceptions , thoughts , and feelings , by themselves , may be sufficient to justify a belief in the existence of other persons . It may be said: "Our observation of our own perceptions may be sufficient to verify or confirm the hypothesis that other persons exist . This hypothesis is one which "works ." The assumption that other persons have particular thoughts , feelings and perceptions enables us to predict that they will have others and that our own perceptions will be modified accordingly: it enables us to predict future perceptions of our own; and we find that these predictions are constantly verified . We observe that we do have the perceptions , which the hypothesis leads us to expect we should have . In short , our perceptions occur just as they would do , if the hypothesis were true; our perceptions behave as if other persons had the perceptions , thoughts and feelings which we suppose them to have . Surely , then , they confirm the truth of the hypothesis--they give some reason to think it probably true ?"  All this , which I have supposed an opponent to urge , I admit to be true . I admit that the fact that an hypothesis works may give some reason to suppose it true . I admit that my perceptions occur just as they would do , if other people had the perceptions which I suppose them to have . I admit that that assumption enables me to make predictions as to future perceptions of my own , and that I observe these predictions to come true . I admit all this . But I admit it only in a sense in which it in no way conflicts with the position which I am maintaining . The words , which I have put into the mouth of a supposed opponent , may , in fact , mean three different things , which it is worth while to distinguish . In two of those meanings , which I shall admit to be true and which are what make them seem plausible , they do not deny what I assert . Only in the third sense are they an objection to my position: and in that sense they are false .  One of the meanings which I admit to be true is as follows:--I have not only admitted but insisted that some of my perceptions are just such as would occur if another person had certain particular feelings: I have insisted that I should not have just those perceptions which I do have , unless some other person had certain feelings and perceptions which I suppose him to have . And I admit further that the fact that I have one of the perceptions in question--for instance , that of another person's hand catching hold of his foot--this fact , together with the true assumption that I should not have this perception , unless some other person felt pain , will justify the assertion that another person has felt pain . In this sense , I admit , the fact that I perceive what I do perceive will give me reason to suppose that another person has felt pain . And , on the other hand , I also admit that the fact that I have this perception , together with the true assumption that when I have it another person has felt pain , may help to justify the assumption that the perception in question is one which I should not have had unless another person had felt pain--it helps to justify the generalisation that certain of my perceptions are just what would occur , if another person had felt pain . In general terms , that is to say , I admit that the occurrence of B , together with the assumption that B is just the sort of thing which would occur if A existed , will justify the assertion that A exists in that particular instance . And I also admit that the occurrence of B , together with the assumption that A exists in that particular instance , may help to justify the assumption that B is just the sort of thing which would exist , if A existed . In other words: When it is said that the observation of B's existence confirms or verifies the assumption that A exists , either of two things may be meant . It may be meant that , assuming B to be the sort of thing which would exist if A existed , the observation of B confirms the assumption that A exists in this particular instance . Or , on the other hand , it may be meant that , assuming A to exist in this particular instance , the observation of B may confirm the generalisation , that B is just the sort of thing which would exist , if A existed . Either the one or the other of these two things is , I think , what is generally assumed , when it is assumed that what we do observe confirms or verifies the assumption that there exists some particular thing which we don't observe . And I am admitting that both these assumptions are true .  But neither of them conflicts in any way with the position I am maintaining . What I am maintaining is that no observation of my own perceptions , by itself , can confirm the generalisation that any one of them is just what would occur if another person had a particular feeling . I admit this generalisation to be true; and I admit that my observation of my own perceptions and feelings may give me reason to suppose that if another person has certain perceptions or feelings he will also have certain others . What I deny is that they give me the slightest reason to suppose that the existence of any such feeling or perception in another has any connection with the existence of any perception of my own--to suppose that any perception of my own is the sort of thing which would occur if another person had a particular feeling . What therefore , my opponent must affirm is that the observation of a perception of my own without the assumption (which Reid makes) that in that particular instance any feeling or perception of another person , of any kind whatever , has preceded it , may give me reason to suppose that that perception of my own is of a kind which is generally preceded by a particular kind of feeling in another person . And this , I think , is plainly false .  But there is yet a third thing which may be meant , and which I am willing to admit may be true . It may be said: "I believe many generalisations of the following kind . I believe that when I have a perception A , some other person has generally had a feeling X; I believe that the existence of the feeling X is generally followed , in the same person , by that of the feeling Y; and I believe also that when another person has the feeling Y , I generally have the perception B . I believe all this ." And it must , I think , be admitted that we do believe generalisations of this kind , and generalisations in which there are not merely two steps between A and B , but a great number of steps . "But then ," it may be said , "my belief in this generalisation causes me , when I observe my perception A , to expect that I shall have the perception B; and such expectations , I observe , are constantly realised ." And this also , I think , must be admitted to be true . "But , finally ," it may be said , "beliefs which produce expectations which are constantly realised are generally true . And hence the fact that these beliefs of mine about the connection of feelings in other persons with perceptions of my own do lead to expectations which are realised , gives me reason to suppose that these generalisations are true and hence that other persons do have particular kinds of feelings ." And I am willing to admit that this also is true . I am willing to admit that true predictions can , as a rule , only be produced by true beliefs . The generalisation that this is so , is , indeed , one which can only be justified by the observations of beliefs , which are , in some way , independently proved to be true; and hence , if it is to be justified , without assuming the existence of anything other than my own perceptions , thoughts , and feelings , it can only be justified by my observation that beliefs with regard to the manner in which these succeed one another generally lead to true predictions . Whether the observation of such beliefs alone could give sufficient reason for it , is , I think , doubtful; but I am willing to admit that it may be so . One thing , however , is , I think , quite plain: namely , that this generalisation "Beliefs which lead to true predictions are generally true" cannot be true , unless some other of the "contents" which I observe , beside my own perceptions , thoughts , and feelings , do exist . That is to say , in giving a reason for supposing the existence of other people , this generalisation also gives a reason for the very theory which I am advocating , namely , that some of those data which I have called "sense-contents" do exist . It does this , because it is quite certain that beliefs in generalisations about the existence of sense-contents can (and do) constantly lead to true predictions . The belief that when I have observed a fire of a certain size in my grate , something similar to what I have observed will continue to exist for a certain time , can , and constantly does , lead to the true prediction that , when I come back to my room in half an hour's time , I shall observe a fire of a certain size still burning . We make predictions on such grounds , I think , every day and all day long . And hence unless such beliefs as that what I observe when I see a fire burning does exist , are true , we certainly have no reason to suppose that beliefs which lead to true predictions are generally true . And hence on this hypothesis also it remains true: that , unless some of the contents which I observe other than my own perceptions , thoughts , and feelings , do exist , I cannot have the slightest reason for supposing that the existence of certain perceptions of my own is generally connected with that of certain perceptions , thoughts , or feelings in any other person .  I conclude therefore that , unless some of the observed data which I have called sense-contents do exist , my own observations cannot give me the slightest reason for believing that anybody else has ever had any particular perception , thought , or feeling . And , having arrived so far towards an answer to my first question: How do we know that any other persons exist ? I may now point out that precisely the same answer must be given to my second question: How do we know that any particular kind of thing exists , other than ourselves , our perceptions , thoughts , and feelings , and what we directly perceive ? There is a view concerning what exists , which deserves , I think , much more respect than it generally receives from philosophers nowadays . The view I mean is the view that material objects , such as they are conceived by physical science , do really exist . It is held by some persons (and Reid is among them) that we do know of the existence , not only of other persons , but also of the movements of matter in space . It is held that we do know , with considerable precision , what kinds of movements of matter generally precede my perception , when I have a particular perception . It is held , for instance , that when I perceive a red and blue book side by side on a shelf , at a certain distance from me , there have existed , between two material objects , which may be called books , and another kind of material object , which may be called my eyes , certain wave-like motions of a material medium; that there have existed two different sets of waves , of which the one is connected with my perception of red and the other with my perception of blue; and that the relative heights and breadths of the two different sets of waves , and the relative velocity of their movements are very exactly known . It is held that some men have a vast amount of very precise information about the existence of objects of this kind; and I think the view that this is so deserves a great deal of respect . But what I wish now to point out is that no one's observation of his own perceptions , thoughts and feelings , can , by itself , give him the slightest reason for believing in the existence of any such material objects . All the arguments by which I have tried to show that this kind of observation alone can give me no reason to believe in the existence of any kind of perception or feeling in another person , apply , with at least equal force , to show that it can give me no reason to believe in the existence of any kind of material object . On the other hand , if we are to admit the principle that "Beliefs which lead to true predictions , are generally true ," this principle will give us at least as much reason to believe in the existence of certain kinds of material objects as to believe in the existence of other persons; since one of the most remarkable facts about beliefs in the existence of such objects is that they do so often lead to true predictions . But it must be remembered that we can have no reason for believing this principle itself , unless our own perceptions , thoughts and feelings are not the only kind of observed "content" which really does exist: we can have no reason for it , unless some such things as what I perceive , when I see a red and blue book side by side , do really exist .  It would seem , therefore , that if my own observations do give me any reason whatever for believing in the existence either of any perception in any other person or of any material object , it must be true that not only my own perceptions , thoughts and feelings , but also some of the other kinds of things which I directly perceive--colours , sounds , smells , etc .--do really exist: it must be true that some objects of this kind exist or are real in precisely the same simple sense in which my perceptions of them exist or are real . Is there then any reason to think that this is not true ? Is there any reason to think , for instance , that none of the colours which I perceive as occupying areas of certain shapes and sizes really exist in the areas which they appear to occupy ? This is a question which I wished to discuss at length , because I think that it is one in which there are real difficulties . But I have given so much space to other questions , that I can only deal with it very briefly here .  Some philosophers are very fond of asserting that a colour cannot exist except when it is perceived; and it might possibly be thought that when I suggest that colours do really exist , I am suggesting that they do exist when they are not perceived . I wish , therefore , briefly to point out that the question whether anything does exist , when it is not perceived , is one which I have not argued and shall not attempt to argue in this paper . I have , indeed , tried to show that since "exists" does not mean "is perceived ," it is , at least , conceivable that things should exist , when they are not perceived . But I have admitted that it is quite possible none do so: it may be the case that whenever a thing exists , it is also at the same time perceived , for anything that I have said or shall say to the contrary . I think , indeed , that , if such things as colours do exist , my observation of their behaviour will justify me in concluding that they also exist when I myself am , at least , not aware of perceiving them: but since I have not attempted to determine what kinds of observation are sufficient to justify a generalisation , I do not pretend to say whether this is so or not: and still less do I pretend to say whether , if they exist when I do not perceive them , we are justified in supposing that someone else must be perceiving them . The question whether anything exists , when it is not perceived , and , if so , what things , seems to me to be one which can only be settled by observation; and thus , I conceive , observation might justify us in concluding that certain kinds of things--pains , for example , do not exist , when they are not perceived and that other kinds of things--colours , for example , do exist , when they are not perceived . The only way , in which , so far as I am aware , the theory I am advocating does conflict with ordinary Idealistic conclusions , is that it does suggest that things , which are not "spiritual ," do sometimes exist , as really and as truly , as things which are .  The theory , therefore , that nothing exists , except when it is perceived , is no objection (even if it be true) to the supposition that colours do exist . What objections are there to this supposition ? All serious objections to it are , I think , of one type . They all rest upon the assumption that , if a certain kind of thing exists at a certain time in a certain place , certain other kinds of things cannot exist at the same time in the same place . They are all , that is to say , of the same type as Berkeley's argument: that , though the same body of water may appear to be simultaneously both hot and cold (if one of the hands we plunge into it is warm and the other cold) , yet the heat and the cold cannot both really be in the same body at the same time . And it is worth noticing that anyone who uses this argument must admit that he understands what is meant by "really existing in a given place ," and that he means by it something other than "being perceived as in a given place ." For the argument itself admits that both the heat and the cold are really perceived as being in the same place , and that there is no difficulty in supposing that they are so; whereas It urges that there is a difficulty in supposing that they both really exist in it .  Now there is one obvious defect in this type of argument , if designed to prove that no sensible quality exists at any place where it is perceived as being--a defect , which Berkeley himself admits in his "Principles ," though he omits to notice it where he repeats the argument in his "Hylas ." Even if we assume that the heat and the cold cannot both exist in the same place (and I admit that , in this case , the contrary assumption does seem repugnant to Common Sense) , it does not follow that neither exists there . That is to say this type of argument , even if we grant its initial assumption , will only entitle us to conclude that some sensible qualities which we perceive as being in a certain place at a certain time , do not exist in that place at that time . And this conclusion , I am inclined to think , is true . In the case , for instance , of the so-called "images" which we perceive in a looking-glass , we may very readily admit that the colours and shapes which we perceive do not exist at the places where they appear to be--namely at various distances behind the glass . But yet , so far as I can see , we have no reason whatever for supposing that they do not , except the assumption that our observations give us reason to believe that other sensible qualities do exist in those positions behind the glass; and the assumption that where these other sensible qualities do exist , those which we see in the glass do not exist . I should , therefore , admit that some sensible qualities which we perceive as being in certain places , do not exist in those places , while still retaining my belief that others do . And perhaps this explanation is the one which should also be adopted in the case of sensible qualities which appear to be at a great distance from us . When , for instance , (as we say) , "we see the moon ," what we perceive (if the moon be full) is a round bright silver disc , of a small size , at a place very distant from us . Does that silver disc exist at that place ? With what suppositions does the assumption that it does conflict ? Only , so far as I can see , with the supposition that the place in question is really occupied by a body such as science has taught us to suppose that the moon really is--a spherical body immensely larger than objects , in comparison with which the silver disc which we perceive is small; or else with the supposition that the place in question is really occupied by some part of our atmosphere , or some part of the medium which science supposes to exist between our atmosphere and the moon; or else with the supposition that the place in question is really occupied by what we might see , if the moon were nearer to us by many thousands of miles . Unless we suppose that some other object is in the place , in which the silver disc appears to be , and that this object is of a kind which cannot occupy the same place which is occupied by a silver disc , we have no reason to suppose that the silver disc does not really exist in the place where it appears to be . And , in this case , we perhaps have reason for both suppositions and should therefore conclude that the silver disc , which we perceive , does not exist in any real place .  Part , therefore , of these objections to our theory may , I think , be met by admitting that some of the  . . . sensible qualities which we perceive do not exist at the places where they appear to exist , though ethers do . But there is , I think , another class of cases , in which we may be justified in denying that two things which (it is asserted) cannot occupy the same space , really cannot . I will take an instance which is , I think , typical . When we look at a drop of blood with the naked eye , we perceive a small red spot , uniformly red all over . But when (as we say) we look at the same object under a microscope of a certain power , I am informed that we see a much larger spot , of similar shape , indeed , but not uniformly red--having , in fact , small red spots at different positions in a yellowish field . And if we were again to look at the same object through a microscope of much higher power still , we might perceive yet a third different arrangement of colours . Is there any fatal objection to supposing that all three appearances--the uniform red spot , the yellowish field with reddish spots in it , and the third , whatever that may be--do all really occupy the same real spatial area ? I cannot see that there is . We are familiar with the idea that a given spatial area may contain parts which are invisible to us . And hence , I think it is quite conceivable that parts of a given area may be really occupied by one colour , while the whole is really occupied by another . And this , I think , is what we actually do believe in many cases . At all events , we certainly believe that the area which appears to be occupied by one colour really is the same area as that which appears to be occupied by another . And , unless we assume that the area , in both cases , really is the same , we can certainly have no reason to deny that each colour does really occupy the area which it appears to occupy .  For these reasons I think that the difficulties in the way of supposing that some of the sensible qualities which we perceive as being in certain places , really exist in the places in which we perceive them to be , are not insuperable . I have indeed not done justice to these difficulties; but then , neither have I done justice to what is to be said on the other side . At all events , I think it is plain that we have no reason to assert , in any case whatever , that a perceived colour does not really exist in the place where it is perceived as being , unless we assume that that very same place really is occupied by something else--either by some different sensible qualities or by material objects such as physical science supposes to exist . But what reason can we give for such an assumption ? I have tried to show that our own observations can give us none , unless we assume that some of the sensible qualities , which we observe as occupying certain places , do really exist in those places . And , if this is so , then we must admit that neither he who believes (with Reid) in the existence of other minds and of matter also , nor he who believes in the existence of other minds and denies that of matter , can have , in his own observations , the slightest reason either for his assertion or for his denial: we must admit that he can have no reason for either assertion or denial , except one which consists in the assumption of the existence or nonexistence of something which he does not observe--something , therefore , of the very same kind as that for which he gives it as a reason . I am very unwilling to suppose that this is the case: I am very unwilling to suppose that he who believes that Sindbad the Sailor really saw what the "Arabian Nights" represent him as seeing , has just as good reason (so far as his own observation goes) for believing this as he who denies it has for denying it . Still this may be the case . We must , perhaps , be content to assume as certain that for which our observation gives no reason: to assume such propositions as that Sindbad did not see a Roc , and that you do hear my voice . But if it is said that these things are certain; then it also appears to me to be certain that the colours which I perceive do exist (some of them) where I perceive them . The more I look at objects round me , the more I am unable to resist the conviction that what I see does exist , as truly and as really , as my perception of it The conviction is overwhelming .  This being , then , the state of the case , I think I may at least plead that we have grounds for suspense of judgment as to whether what I see does not really exist; grounds , too , for renewed enquiry , more careful than such enquiry has sometimes been in the past .   [1] Not now in 1921 .     WILLIAM JAMES   My object in this paper is to discuss some of the things which Prof . William James says about truth in the recent book , to which he has given the above name .[1] In Lecture VI he professes to give an account of a theory , which he calls "the pragmatist theory of truth;" and he professes to give a briefer preliminary account of the same theory in Lecture II . Moreover , in Lecture VII , he goes on to make some further remarks about truth . In all these Lectures he seems to me to make statements to which there are very obvious objections; and my main object is to point out , as clearly and simply as I can , what seem to me to be the principal objections to some of these statements .  We may , I think , distinguish three different things which he seems particularly anxious to assert about truth .  (I) In the first place , he is plainly anxious to assert some connection between truth and "verification" or "utility ." Our true ideas , he seems to say , are those that "work ," in the sense that they are or can be "verified ," or are "useful ."  (II) In the second place , he seems to object to the view that truth is something "static" or "immutable ." He is anxious to assert that truths are in some sense "mutable ."  (III) In the third place , he asserts that "to an unascertainable extent our truths are man-made products" (p . 242) .  To what he asserts under each of these three heads there are , I think , serious objections; and I now propose to point out what seem to me to be the principal ones , under each head separately .   (I)  Professor James is plainly anxious to assert some connection between truth and "verification" or "utility ." And that there is some connection between them everybody will admit . That many of our true ideas are verified; that many of them can be verified; and that many of them are useful , is , I take it , quite indisputable . But Professor James seems plainly to wish to assert something more than this . And one more thing which he wishes to assert is , I think , pretty plain . He suggests , at the beginning of Lecture VI , that he is going to tell us in what sense it is that our true ideas "agree with reality ." Truth , he says , certainly means their agreement with reality; the only question is as to what we are to understand by the words "agreement" and "reality" in this proposition . And he first briefly considers the theory , that the sense in which our true ideas agree with reality , is that they "copy" some reality . And he affirms that some of our true ideas really do do this . But he rejects the theory , as a theory of what truth means , on the ground that they do not all do so . Plainly , therefore , he implies that no theory of what truth means will be correct , unless it tells us of some property which belongs to all our true ideas without exception . But his own theory is a theory of what truth means . Apparently , therefore , he wishes to assert that not only many but all our true ideas are or can be verified; that all of them are useful . And it is , I think , pretty plain that this is one of the things which he wishes to assert .  Apparently , therefore , Professor James wishes to assert that all our true ideas are or can be verified--that all are useful . And certainly this is not a truism like the proposition that many of them are so . Even if this were all that he meant , it would be worth discussing . But even this , I think , is not all . The very first proposition in which he expresses his theory is the following . "True ideas ," he says (p . 201) "are those that we can assimilate , validate , corroborate and verify . False ideas are those that we cannot ." And what does this mean ? Let us , for brevity's sake , substitute the word "verify" alone for the four words which Professor James uses , as he himself subsequently seems to do . He asserts , then , that true ideas are those which we can verify . And plainly he does not mean by this merely that some of the ideas which we can verify are true , while plenty of others , which we can verify , are not true . The plain meaning of his words is that all the ideas which we can verify are true . No one would use them who did not mean this . Apparently , therefore , Professor James means to assert not merely that we can verify all our true ideas; but also that all the ideas , which we can verify , are true . And so , too , with utility or usefulness . He seems to mean not merely that all our true ideas are useful; but that all those which are useful are true . This would follow , for one thing , from the fact that he seems to use the words "verification" or "verifiability" and "usefulness" as if they came to the same thing . But , in this case too , he asserts it in words that have but one plain meaning . "The true" he says (p . 222) "is only the expedient in the way of our thinking ." "The true" is the expedient: that is , all expedient thinking is true . Or again: "An idea is 'true' so long as to believe it is profitable to our lives" (p . 75) . That is to say , every idea , which is profitable to our lives , is , while it is so , true . These words certainly have a plain enough meaning . Apparently , therefore , Professor James means to assert not merely that all true ideas are useful , but also that all useful ideas are true .  Professor James' words , then , do at least suggest that he wishes to assert all four of the following propositions . He wishes to assert , it would seem--  (1) That we can verify all those of our ideas , which are true .  (2) That all those among our ideas , which we can verify , are true .  (3) That all our true ideas are useful .  (4) That all those of our ideas , which are useful , are true .  These four propositions are what I propose first to consider . He does mean to assert them , at least . Very likely he wishes to assert something more even than these . He does , in fact , suggest that he means to assert , in addition , that these properties of "verifiability" and "utility" are the only properties (beside that of being properly called "true") which belong to all our true ideas and to none but true ideas . But this obviously cannot be true , unless all these four propositions are true . And therefore we may as well consider them first .  First , then , can we verify all our true ideas ?  I wish only to point out the plainest and most obvious reasons why I think it is doubtful whether we can .  We are very often in doubt as to whether we did or did not do a certain thing in the past . We may have the idea that we did , and also the idea that we did not; and we may wish to find out which idea is the true one . Very often , indeed , I may believe very strongly , that I did do a certain thing; and somebody else , who has equally good reason to know , may believe equally strongly that I did not . For instance , I may have written a letter , and may believe that I used certain words in it . But my correspondent may believe that I did not . Can we always verify either of these ideas ? Certainly sometimes we can . The letter may be produced , and prove that I did use the words in question . And I shall then have verified my idea . Or it may prove that I did not use them . And then we shall have verified my correspondent's idea . But , suppose the letter has been destroyed; suppose there is no copy of it , nor any trustworthy record of what was said in it; suppose there is no other witness as to what I said in it , beside myself and my correspondent ? Can we then always verify which of our ideas is the true one ? I think it is very doubtful whether we can nearly always . Certainly we may often try to discover any possible means of verification , and be quite unable , for a time at least , to discover any . Such cases , in which we are unable , for a time at least , to verify either of two contradictory ideas , occur very commonly indeed . Let us take an even more trivial instance than the last . Bad whist-players often do not notice at all carefully which cards they have among the lower cards in a suit . At the end of a hand they cannot be certain whether they had or had not the seven of diamonds , or the five of spades . And , after the cards have been shuffled , a dispute will sometimes arise as to whether a particular player had the seven of diamonds or not . His partner may think that he had , and he himself may think that he had not . Both may be uncertain , and the memory of both , on such a point , may be well known to be untrustworthy . And , moreover , neither of the other players may be able to remember any better . Is it always possible to verify which of these ideas is the true one ? Either the player did or did not have the seven of diamonds . This much is certain . One person thinks that he did , and another thinks he did not; and both , so soon as the question is raised , have before their minds both of these ideas--the idea that he did , and the idea that he did not . This also is certain . And it is certain that one or other of these two ideas is true . But can they always verify either of them ? Sometimes , no doubt , they can , even after the cards have been shuffled . There may have been a fifth person present , overlooking the play , whose memory is perfectly trustworthy , and whose word may be taken as settling the point . Or the players may themselves be able , by recalling other incidents of play , to arrive at such a certainty as may be said to verify the one hypothesis or the other . But very often neither of these two things will occur . And , in such a case , is it always possible to verify the true idea ? Perhaps , theoretically , it may be still possible . Theoretically , I suppose , the fact that one player , and not any of the other three , had the card in his hand , may have made some difference to the card , which might be discovered by some possible method of scientific investigation . Perhaps some such difference may remain even after the same card has been repeatedly used in many subsequent games . But suppose the same question arises again , a week after the original game was played . Did you , or did you not , last week have the seven of diamonds in that particular hand ? The question has not been settled in the meantime; and now , perhaps , the original pack of cards has been destroyed . Is it still possible to verify either idea ? Theoretically , I suppose , it may be still possible . But even this , I think , is very doubtful . And surely it is plain that , humanly and practically speaking , it will often have become quite impossible to verify either idea . In all probability it never will be possible for any man to verify whether I had the card or not on this particular occasion . No doubt we are here speaking of an idea , which some man could have verified at one time . But the hypothesis I am considering is the hypothesis that we never have a true idea , which we can not verify; that is to say , which we cannot verify after the idea has occurred . And with regard to this hypothesis , it seems to me quite plain that very often indeed we have two ideas , one or other of which is certainly true; and yet that , in all probability , it is no longer possible and never will be possible for any man to verify either .  It seems to me , then , that we very often have true ideas which we cannot verify; true ideas , which , in all probability , no man ever will be able to verify . And , so far , I have given only comparatively trivial instances . But it is plain that , in the same sense , historians are very frequently occupied with true ideas , which it is doubtful whether they can verify . One historian thinks that a certain event took place , and another that it did not; and both may admit that they cannot verify their idea . Subsequent historians may , no doubt , sometimes be able to verify one or the other . New evidence may be discovered or men may learn to make a better use of evidence already in existence . But is it certain that this will always happen ? Is it certain that every question , about which historians have doubted , will some day be able to be settled by verification of one or the other hypothesis ? Surely the probability is that in the case of an immense number of events , with regard to which we should like to know whether they happened or not , it never will be possible for any man to verify either the one hypothesis or the other . Yet it may be certain that either the events in question did happen or did not . Here , therefore , again , we have a large number of ideas--cases where many men doubt whether a thing did happen or did not , and have therefore the idea both of its having happened and of its not having happened--with regard to which it is certain that half of them are true , but where it seems highly doubtful whether any single one of them will ever be able to be verified . No doubt it is just possible that men will some day be able to verify every one of them . But surely it is very doubtful whether they will . And the theory against which I am protesting is the positive assertion that we can verify all our true ideas--that some one some day certainly will be able to verify every one of them . This theory , I urge , has all probability against it .  And so far I have been dealing only with ideas with regard to what happened in the past . These seem to me to be the cases which offer the most numerous and most certain exceptions to the rule that we can verify our true ideas . With regard to particular past events , either in their own lives or in those of other people , men very frequently have ideas , which it seems highly improbable that any man will ever be able to verify . And yet it is certain that a great many of these ideas are true , because in a great many cases we have both the idea that the event did happen and also the idea that it did not , when it is certain that one or other of these ideas is true . And these ideas with regard to past events would by themselves be sufficient for my purpose . If , as seems certain , there are many true ideas with regard to the past , which it is highly improbable that anyone will ever be able to verify , then , obviously , there is nothing in a true idea which makes it certain that we can verify it . But it is , I think , certainly not only in the case of ideas , with regard to the past , that it is doubtful whether we can verify all the true ideas we have . In the case of many generalisations dealing not only with the past but with the future , it is , I think , obviously doubtful whether we shall ever be able to verify all those which are true; although here , perhaps , in most cases , the probability that we shall not is not so great . But is it quite certain , that in all cases where scientific men have considered hypotheses , one or other of which must be true , either will ever be verified ? It seems to be obviously doubtful . Take , for instance , the question whether our actual space is Euclidean or not . This is a case where the alternative has been considered; and where it is certain that , whatever be meant by "our actual space ," it either is Euclidean or is not . It has been held , too , that the hypothesis that it is not Euclidean might , conceivably , be verified by observations . But it is doubtful whether it ever will be . And though it would be rash to say that no man ever will be able to verify either hypothesis; it is also rash to assert positively that we shall--that we certainly can verify the true hypotheses . There are , I believe , ever so many similar cases , where alternative hypotheses , one or other of which must be true , have occurred to men of science , and where yet it is very doubtful whether either ever will be verified . Or take , again , such ideas as the idea that there is a God , or the idea that we are immortal . Many men have had not only contradictory ideas , but contradictory beliefs , about these matters . And here we have cases where it is disputed whether these ideas have not actually been verified . But it seems to me doubtful whether they have been . And there is a view , which seems to me to deserve respect , that , in these matters , we never shall be able to verify the true hypothesis . Is it perfectly certain that this view is a false one ? I do not say that it is true . I think it is quite possible that we shall some day be able to verify either the belief that we are immortal or the belief that we are not . But it seems to me doubtful whether we shall . And for this reason alone I should refuse to assent to the positive assertion that we certainly can verify all our true ideas .  When , therefore , Professor James tells us that "True ideas are those that we can assimilate , validate , corroborate and verify . False ideas are those that we cannot ," there seems to be a serious objection to part of what these words imply . They imply that no idea of ours is true , unless we can verify it . They imply , therefore , that whenever a man wonders whether or not he had the seven of diamonds in the third hand at whist last night , neither of these ideas is true unless he can verify it . But it seems certain that in this , and an immense number of similar cases , one or other of the two ideas is true . Either , he did have the card in his hand or he did not . If anything is a fact , this is one . Either , therefore , Professor James' words imply the denial of this obvious fact , or else he implies that in all such cases we can verify one or other of the two ideas . But to this the objection is that , in any obvious sense of the words , it seems very doubtful whether we can . On the contrary it seems extremely probable that in a very large number of such cases no man ever will be able to verify either of the two ideas . There is , therefore , a serious objection to what Professor James' words imply . Whether he himself really means to assert these things which his words imply I do not know . Perhaps he would admit that , in this sense , we probably cannot verify nearly all our true ideas . All that I have wished to make plain is that there is , at least , an objection to what he says , whether to what he means or not . There is ample reason why we should refuse assent to the statement that none of our ideas are true , except those which we can verify .  But to another part of what he implies by the words quoted above , there is , I think , no serious objection . There is reason to object to the statement that we can verify all our true ideas; but to the statement that all ideas , which we can "assimilate , validate , corroborate and verify ," are true , I see no serious objection . Here , I think , we might say simply that all ideas which we can verify are true . To this , which is the second of the four propositions , which I distinguished above (p . 35) as what Professor James seems to wish to assert , there is , I think , no serious objection , if we understand the word "verify" in its proper and natural sense . We may , no doubt , sometimes say that we have verified an idea or an hypothesis , when we have only obtained evidence which proves it to be probable , and does not prove it to be certain . And , if we use the word in this loose sense for incomplete verification , it is obviously the case that we may verify an idea which is not true . But it seems scarcely necessary to point this out . And where we really can completely verify an idea or an hypothesis , there , undoubtedly , the idea which we can verify is always true . The very meaning of the word "verify" is to find evidence which does really prove an idea to be true; and where an idea can be really proved to be true , it is of course , always true .  This is all I wish to say about Professor James' first two propositions , namely:--  (1) That no ideas of ours are true , except those which we can verify .  (2) That all those ideas , which we can verify , are true .  The first seems to me extremely doubtful--in fact , almost certainly untrue; the second on the other hand , certainly true , in its most obvious meaning . And I shall say no more about them . The fact is , I doubt whether either of them expresses anything which Professor James is really anxious to assert . I have mentioned them , only because his words do , in fact , imply them and because he gives those words a very prominent place . But I have already had occasion to notice that he seems to speak as if to say that we can verify an idea came to the same thing as saying it is useful to us . And it is the connection of truth with usefulness , not its connection with "verification ," that he is , I think , really anxious to assert . He talks about "verification" only , I believe , because he thinks that what he says about it will support his main view that truth is what "works ," is "useful ," is "expedient ," "pays ." It is this main view we have now to consider . We have to consider the two propositions:--  (3) That all our true ideas are useful .  (4) That all ideas , which are useful , are true .  First , then: is it the case that all our true ideas are useful ? Is it the case that none of our ideas are true , except those which are useful ?  I wish to introduce my discussion of this question by quoting a passage in which Professor James seems to me to say something which is indisputably true . Towards the end of Lecture VI , he attacks the view that truths "have an unconditional claim to be recognised ." And in the course of his attack the following passage occurs:--  "Must I ," he says , "constantly be repeating the truth 'twice two are four' because of its eternal claim on recognition ? or is it sometimes irrelevant ? Must my thoughts dwell night and day on my personal sins and blemishes , because I truly have them ?--or may I sink and ignore them in order to be a decent social unit , and not a mass of morbid melancholy and apology ?"  "It is quite evident ," he goes on , "that our obligation to acknowledge truth , so far from being unconditional , is tremendously conditional . Truth with a big T , and in the singular , claims abstractly to be recognised , of course; but concrete truths in the plural need be recognised only when their recognition is expedient ." (pp . 231-232) .  What Professor James says in this passage seems to me so indisputably true as fully to justify the vigour of his language . It is as clear as anything can be that it would not be useful for any man's mind to be always occupied with the true idea that he had certain faults and blemishes; or to be always occupied with the idea that twice two are four . It is clear , that is , that , if there are times at which a particular true idea is useful , there certainly are other times at which it would not be useful , but positively in the way . This is plainly true of nearly all , if not quite all , our true ideas . It is plainly true with regard to nearly all of them that , even if the occasions on which their occurrence is useful are many , the occasions on which their occurrence would not be useful are many more . With regard to most of them it is true that on most occasions they will , as Professor James says elsewhere , "be practically irrelevant , and had better remain latent ."  It is , then , quite clear that almost any particular true idea would not be useful at all times and that the times at which it would not be useful , are many more than the times at which it would . And what we have to consider is whether , in just this sense in which it is so clear that most true ideas would not be useful at most times , it is nevertheless true that all our true ideas are useful . Is this so ? Are all our true ideas useful ?  Professor James , we see , has just told us that there are ever so many occasions upon which a particular true idea , such as that 2 + 2= 4 , would not be useful--when , on the contrary , it would be positively in the way . And this seems to be indisputably clear . But is not something else almost equally clear ? Is it not almost equally clear that cases , such as he says would not be useful , do sometimes actually happen ? Is it not clear that we do actually sometimes have true ideas , at times when they are not useful , but are positively in the way ? It seems to me to be perfectly clear that this does sometimes occur; and not sometimes only , but very commonly . The cases in which true ideas occur at times when they are useful , are , perhaps , far more numerous; but , if we look at men in general , the cases in which true ideas occur , at times when they are not useful , do surely make up positively a very large number . Is it not the case that men do sometimes dwell on their faults and blemishes , when it is not useful for them to do so ? when they would much better be thinking of something else ? Is it not the case that they are often unable to get their minds away from a true idea , when it is harmful for them to dwell on it ? Still more commonly , does it not happen that they waste their time in acquiring pieces of information which are no use to them , though perhaps very useful to other people ? All this seems to me to be undeniable--just as undeniable as what Professor James himself has said; and , if this is so , then , in one sense of the words , it is plainly not true that all , or nearly all , our true ideas are useful . In one sense of the words . For if I have the idea that 2+2=4 on one day , and then have it again the next , I may certainly , in a sense , call the idea I have on one day one idea , and the idea I have on the next another . I have had two ideas that 2+2=4 , and not one only . Or if two different persons both think that I have faults , there have been two ideas of this truth and not one only . And in asking whether all our true ideas are useful , we might mean to ask whether both of these ideas were useful and not merely whether one of them was . In this sense , then , it is plainly not true that all our true ideas are useful . It is not true , that is , that every true idea is useful , whenever it occurs .  In one sense , then , it is plainly not true that all our true ideas are useful . But there still remains a perfectly legitimate sense in which it might be true . It might be meant , that is , not that every occurrence of a true idea is useful , but that every true idea is useful on at least one of the occasions when it occurs . But is this , in fact , the case ? It seems to me almost as plain that it is not , as that the other was not . We have seen that true ideas are not by any means always useful on every occasion when they occur; though most that do occur many times over and to many different people are , no doubt , useful on some of these occasions . But there seems to be an immense number of true ideas , which occur but once and to one person , and never again either to him or to anyone else . I may , for instance , idly count the number of dots on the back of a card , and arrive at a true idea of their number; and yet , perhaps , I may never think of their number again , nor anybody else ever know it . We are all , it seems to me , constantly noticing trivial details , and getting true ideas about them , of which we never think again , and which nobody else ever gets . And is it quite certain that all these true ideas are useful ? It seems to me perfectly clear , on the contrary , that many of them are not . Just as it is clear that many men sometimes waste their time in acquiring information which is useful to others but not to them , surely it is clear that they sometimes waste their time in acquiring information , which is useful to nobody at all , because nobody else ever acquires it . I do not say that it is never useful idly to count the number of dots on the back of a card . Plainly it is sometimes useful to be idle , and one idle employment may often be as good as another . But surely it is true that men sometimes do these things when their time would have been better employed otherwise ? Surely they sometimes get into the habit of attending to trivial truths , which it is as great a disadvantage that they should attend to as that they should constantly be thinking of their own thoughts and blemishes ? I cannot see my way to deny that this is so; and therefore I cannot see my way to assert positively that all our true ideas are useful , even so much as on one occasion . It seems to me that there are many true ideas which occur but once , and which are not useful when they do occur . And if this be so , then it is plainly not true that all our true ideas are useful in any sense at all .  These seem to me to be the most obvious objections to the assertion that all our true ideas are useful . It is clear , we saw to begin with , that true ideas , which are sometimes useful , would not be useful at all times . And it seemed almost equally clear that they do sometimes occur at times when they are not useful . Our true ideas , therefore are not useful at every time when they actually occur . But in just this sense in which it is so clear that true ideas which are sometimes useful , nevertheless sometimes occur at times when they are not , it seems pretty plain that true ideas , which occur but once , are , some of them , not useful . If an idea , which is sometimes useful , does sometimes occur to a man at a time when it is irrelevant and in the way , why should not an idea , which occurs but once , occur at a time when it is irrelevant and in the way ? It seems hardly possible to doubt that this does sometimes happen . But , if this be so , then it is not true that all our true ideas are useful , even so much as on one occasion . It is not true that none of our ideas are true , except those which are useful .  But now , what are we to say of the converse proposition--the proposition that all those among our ideas , which are useful , are true ? That we never have a useful idea , which is not true ?  I confess the matter seems to me equally clear here . The assertion should mean that every idea , which is at any time useful , is true; that no idea , which is not true , is ever useful . And it seems hardly possible to doubt that this assertion is false . It Is , in the first place , commonly held that it is sometimes right positively to deceive another person . In war , for instance it is held that one army is justified in trying to give the enemy a false idea as to where it will be at a given time . Such a false idea is sometimes given , and it seems to me quite clear that it is sometimes useful . In such a case , no doubt , it may be said that the false idea is useful to the party who have given it , but not useful to those who actually believe in it . And the question whether it is useful on the whole will depend upon the question which side it is desirable should win . But it seems to me unquestionable that the false idea is sometimes useful on the whole . Take , for instance , the case of a party of savages , who wish to make a night attack and massacre a party of Europeans but are deceived as to the position in which the Europeans are encamped . It is surely plain that such a false idea is sometimes useful on the whole . But quite apart from the question whether deception is ever justifiable , it is not very difficult to think of cases where a false idea , not produced by deception , is plainly useful--and useful , not merely on the whole , but to the person who has it as well . A man often thinks that his watch is right , when , in fact , it is slow , and his false idea may cause him to miss his train . And in such cases , no doubt , his false idea is generally disadvantageous . But , in a particular case , the train which he would have caught but for his false idea may be destroyed in a railway accident , or something may suddenly occur at home , which renders it much more useful that he should be there , than it would have been for him to catch his train . Do such cases never occur ? And is not the false idea sometimes useful in some of them ? It seems to me perfectly clear that it is sometimes useful for a man to think his watch is right when it is wrong . And such instances would be sufficient to show that it is not the case that every idea of ours , which is ever useful , is a true idea . But let us take cases , not , like these , of an idea , which occurs but a few times or to one man , but of ideas which have occurred to many men at many times . It seems to me very difficult to be sure that the belief in an eternal hell has not been often useful to many men , and yet it may be doubted whether this idea is true . And so , too , with the belief in a happy life after death , or the belief in the existence of a God; it is , I think , very difficult to be sure that these beliefs have not been , and are not still , often useful , and yet it may be doubted whether they are true . These beliefs , of course , are matters of controversy . Some men believe that they are both useful and true; and others , again , that they are neither . And I do not think we are justified in giving them as certain instances of beliefs , which are not true , but , nevertheless , have often been useful . But there is a view that these beliefs , though not true , have , nevertheless , been often useful; and this view seems to me to deserve respect , especially since , as we have seen , some beliefs , which are not true , certainly are sometimes useful . Are we justified in asserting positively that it is false ? Is it perfectly certain that beliefs , which have often been useful to many men , may not , nevertheless , be untrue ? Is it perfectly certain that beliefs , which are not true , have not often been useful to many men ? The certainty may at least be doubted , and in any case it seems certain that some beliefs , which are not true , are , nevertheless , sometimes useful .  For these reasons , it seems to me almost certain that both the assertions which I have been considering are false . It is almost certainly false that all our true ideas are useful , and almost certainly false that all our useful ideas are true . But I have only urged what seem to me to be the most obvious objections to these two statements; I have not tried to sustain these objections by elaborate arguments , and I have omitted elaborate argument , partly because of a reason which I now wish to state . The fact is , I am not at all sure that Professor James would not himself admit that both these statements are false . I think it is quite possible he would admit that they are , and would say that he never meant either to assert or to imply the contrary . He complains that some of the critics of Pragmatism are unwilling to read any but the silliest of possible meanings into the statements of Pragmatism; and , perhaps , he would say that this is the case here . I certainly hope that he would . I certainly hope he would say that these statements , to which I have objected , are silly . For it does seem to me intensely silly to say that we can verify all our true ideas; intensely silly to say that every one of our true ideas is at some time useful; intensely silly to say that every idea which is ever useful is true . I hope Professor James would admit all these things to be silly , for if he and other Pragmatists would admit even as much as this , I think a good deal would be gained . But it by no means follows that because a philosopher would admit a view to be silly , when it is definitely put before him , he has not himself been constantly holding and implying that very view . He may quite sincerely protest that he never has either held or implied it , and yet he may all the time have been not only implying it but holding it--vaguely , perhaps , but really . A man may assure us , quite sincerely that he is not angry; he may really think that he is not , and yet we may be able to judge quite certainly from what he says that he really is angry . He may assure us quite sincerely that he never meant anything to our discredit by what he said--that he was not thinking of anything in the least discreditable to us , and yet it may be plain from his words that he was actually condemning us very severely . And so with a philosopher . He may protest , quite angrily , when a view is put before him in other words than his own , that he never either meant or implied any such thing , and yet it may be possible to judge , from what he says , that this very view , wrapped up in other words , was not only held by him but was precisely what made his thoughts seem to him to be interesting and important . Certainly he may quite often imply a given thing which , at another time , he denies . Unless it were possible for a philosopher to do this , there would be very little inconsistency in philosophy , and surely everyone will admit that other philosophers are very often inconsistent . And so in this case , even if Professor James would say that he never meant to imply the things to which I have been objecting , yet in the case of two of these things , I cannot help thinking that he does actually imply them--nay more , that he is frequently actually vaguely thinking of them , and that his theory of truth owes its interest , in very great part , to the fact that he is implying them . In the case of the two views that all our true ideas are useful , and that all our useful ideas are true , I think this is so , and I do not mean merely that his words imply them . A man's words may often imply a thing , when he himself is in no way , however vaguely , thinking either of that thing or of anything which implies it; he may simply have expressed himself unfortunately . But in the case of the two views that all our true ideas are useful , and all our useful ideas true , I do not think this is so with Professor James . I think that his thoughts seem interesting to him and others , largely because he is thinking , not merely of words , but of things which imply these two views , in the very form in which I have objected to them . And I wish now to give some reasons for thinking this .  Professor James certainly wishes to assert that there is some connection between truth and utility . And the connection which I have suggested that he has vaguely before his mind is this: that every true idea is , at some time or other , useful , and conversely that every idea , which is ever useful , is true . And I have urged that-there are obvious objections to both these views . But now , supposing Professor James does not mean to assert either of these two things , what else can he mean to assert ? What else can he mean , that would account for the interest and importance he seems to attach to his assertion of connection between truth and utility ? Let us consider the alternatives .  And , first of all , he might mean that most of our true ideas are useful , and most of our useful ideas true . He might mean that most of our true ideas are useful at some time or other; and even that most of them are useful , whenever they actually occur . And he might mean , moreover , that if we consider the whole range of ideas , which are useful to us , we shall find that by far the greater number of them are true ones; that true ideas are far more often useful to us , than those which are not true . And all this , I think , may be readily admitted to be true . If this were all that he meant , I do not think that anyone would be very anxious to dispute it . But is it conceivable that this is all that he means ? Is it conceivable that he should have been so anxious to insist upon this admitted commonplace ? Is it conceivable that he should have been offering us this , and nothing more , as a theory of what truth means , and a theory worth making a fuss about , and being proud of ? It seems to me quite inconceivable that this should have been all that he meant . He must have had something more than this in his mind . But , if so , what more ?  In the passage which I quoted at the beginning , as showing that he does mean to assert that all useful ideas are true , he immediately goes on to assert a qualification , which must now be noticed . "The true ," he says , "is only the expedient in the way of our thinking" (p . 222) . But he immediately adds: "Expedient in the long run , and on the whole , of course; for what meets expediently all the experience in sight won't necessarily meet all further experiences equally satisfactorily ." Here , therefore , we have something else that he might mean . What is expedient in the long run , he means to say , is true . And what exactly does this mean ? It seems to mean that an idea , which is not true , may be expedient for some time . That is to say , it may occur once , and be expedient then; and again , and be expedient then; and so on , over a considerable period . But (Professor James seems to prophesy) if it is not true , there will come a time , when it will cease to be expedient . If it occurs again and again over a long enough period , there will at last , if it is not true , come a time when it will (for once at least) fail to be useful , and will (perhaps he means) never be useful again . This is , 1 think , what Professor James means in this passage . He means , I think , that though an idea , which is not true , may for some time be repeatedly expedient , there will at last come a time when its occurrence will , perhaps , never be expedient again , certainly will , for a time , not be generally expedient . And this a view which , it seems to me , may possibly be true . It is certainly possible that a time may come , in the far future , when ideas , which are not true , will hardly ever , if ever , be expedient . And this is all that Professor James seems here positively to mean . He seems to mean that , if you take time enough , false ideas will some day cease to be expedient . And it is very difficult to be sure that this is not true; since it is very difficult to prophesy as to what may happen in the far future . I am sure I hope that this prophesy will come true . But in the meantime (Professor James seems to admit) ideas , which are not true , may , for an indefinitely long time , again and again be expedient . And is it conceivable that a theory , which admits this , is all that he has meant to assert ? Is it conceivable that what interests him , in his theory of truth , is merely the belief that , some day or other , false ideas will cease to be expedient ? "In the long run , of course ," he says , as if this were what he had meant all along . But I think it is quite plain that this is not all that he has meant . This may be one thing which he is anxious to assert , but it certainly does not explain the whole of his interest in his theory of truth .  And , in fact , there is quite a different theory which he seems plainly to have in his mind in other places . When Professor James says , "in the long run , of course ," he implies that ideas which are expedient only for a short run , are very often not true . But in what he says elsewhere he asserts the very opposite of this . He says elsewhere that a belief is true "so long as to believe it is profitable to our lives" (p . 75) . That is to say , a belief will be true , so long as it is useful , even if it is not useful in the long run! This is certainly quite a different theory; and , strictly speaking , it implies that an idea , which is useful even on one occasion , will be true . But perhaps this is only a verbal implication . I think very likely that here Professor James was only thinking of ideas , which can be said to have a run , though only a comparatively short one--of ideas , that is , which are expedient , not merely on one occasion , but for some time . That is to say , the theory which he now suggests , is that ideas , which occur again and again , perhaps to one man only , perhaps to several different people , over some space of time are , if they are expedient on most occasions within that space of time , true . This is a view which he is , I think , really anxious to assert; and if it were true , it would , I think , be important . And it is difficult to find instances which show , with certainty , that it is false . I believe that it is false; but it is difficult to prove it , because , in the case of some ideas it is so difficult to be certain that they ever were useful , and in the case of others so difficult to be certain that they are not true . A belief such as I spoke of before--the belief in eternal hell--is an instance . I think this belief has been , for a long time , useful , and that yet it is false . But it is , perhaps , arguable that it never has been useful; and many people on the other hand , would still assert that it is true . It cannot , therefore , perhaps , fairly be used as an instance of a belief , which is certainly not true , and yet has for some time been useful . But whether this view that all beliefs , which are expedient for some time , are true , be true or false; can it be all that Professor James means to assert ? Can it constitute the whole of what interests him in his theory of truth ?  I do not think it can . I think it is plain that he has in his mind something more than any of these alternatives , or than all of them taken together . And I think so partly for the following reason . He speaks from the outset as if he intended to tell us what distinguishes true ideas from those which are not true; to tell us , that is to say , not merely of some property which belongs to all our true ideas; nor yet merely of some property , which belongs to none but true ideas; but of some property which satisfies both these requirements at once--which both belongs to all our true ideas , and also belongs to none but true ones . Truth , he says to begin with , means the agreement of our ideas with reality; and he adds "as falsity their disagreement ." And he explains that he is going to tell us what property it is that is meant by these words "agreement with reality ." So again in the next passage which I quoted: "True ideas ," he says "are those that we can assimilate , validate , corroborate and verify ." But , he also adds , "False ideas are those that we cannot ." And no one , I think , could possibly speak in this way , who had not in his head the intention of telling us what property it is which distinguishes true ideas from those which are not true , and which , therefore , not only belongs to all ideas which are true , but also to none that are not . And that he has this idea in his head and thinks that the property of being "useful" or "paying" is such a property , is again clearly shown by a later passage . "Our account of truth ," he says (p . 218) "is an account of truths in the plural , of processes of leading , realised in rebus , and having only this quality in common , that they pay ." Only this quality in common! If this be so , the quality must obviously be one , which is not shared by any ideas which are not true; for , if true ideas have any quality in common at all , they must have at least one such quality , which is not shared by those which are not true . Plainly , therefore , Professor James is intending to tell us of a property which belongs both to all true ideas and only to true ideas . And this property , he says , is that of "paying ." But now let us suppose that he means by "paying ," not "paying once at least ," but , according to the alternative he suggests , "paying in the long run" or "paying for some time ." Can he possibly have supposed that these were properties which belonged both to all true ideas and also to none but true ones ? They may , perhaps , be properties which belong to none but true ones . I doubt , as I have said , whether the latter does; but still it is difficult to prove the opposite . But even if we granted that they belong to none but true ones , surely it is only too obvious that they do not fulfil the other requirement--that they do not belong to nearly all true ones . Can anyone suppose that all our true ideas pay "in the long run" or repeatedly for some time ? Surely it is plain that an enormous number do not for the simple reason that an enormous number of them have no run at all , either long or short , but occur but once , and never recur . I believe truly that a certain book is on a particular shelf about 10 .15 p .m . on December 21st , 1907; and this true belief serves me well and helps me to find it But the belief that that book is there at that particular time occurs to no one else , and never again to me . Surely there are thousands of useful true beliefs which , like this , are useful but once , and never occur again; and it would , therefore , be preposterous to say that every true idea is useful "in the long run" or repeatedly for some time . If , therefore , we supposed Professor James to mean that "paying in the long run" or "paying repeatedly over a considerable period" were properties which belonged to all true ideas and to none but true ones , we should be supposing him to mean something still more monstrous than if we suppose him to mean that "paying at least once" was such a property .  To sum up then:  I think there is no doubt that Professor James' interest in "the pragmatist theory of truth" is largely due to the fact that he thinks it tells us what distinguishes true ideas from those which are not true . And he thinks the distinction is that true ideas "pay ," and false ones don't . The most natural interpretation of this view is: That every true idea pays at least once; and that every idea , which pays at least once , is true . These were the propositions I considered first , and I gave reasons for thinking that both are false . But Professor James suggested elsewhere that what he means by "paying" is "paying in the long run ." And here it seems possibly true that all ideas which "pay in the long run" are true; but it is certainly false that all our true ideas "pay in the long run ," if by this be meant anything more than "pay at least once ." Again , he suggested that what he meant by paying was "paying for some time ." And here , again , even if it is true (and it seems very doubtful) that all ideas which pay for some time are true , it is certainly false that all our true ideas pay for some time , if by this be meant anything more than that they pay "at least once ."  This , I think , is the simplest and most obvious objection to Professor James' "instrumental" view of truth--the view that truth is what "works ," "pays ," is "useful ." He seems certainly to have in his mind the idea that this theory tells us what distinguishes true ideas from false ones , and to be interested in it mainly for this reason . He has vaguely in his mind that he has told us of some property which belongs to all true ideas and to none but true ones; and that this property is that of "paying ." And the objection is , that , whatever we understand by "paying ," whether "paying at least once ," or "paying in the long run ," or "paying for some time ," it seems certain that none of these properties will satisfy both requirements . As regards the first , that of "paying at least once ," it seems almost certain that it satisfies neither: it is neither true that all our true ideas "pay at least once ," nor yet that every idea which pays at least once , is true . On the contrary , many true ideas never pay at all; and many ideas , which are not true , do pay on at least one occasion . And as regards the others , "paying in the long run" and "paying for some time ," even if these do belong to none but true ideas (and even this seems very doubtful) , they certainly neither of them satisfy the other requirement--neither of them belong to all our true ideas . For , in order that either of them may belong to an idea , that idea must pay at least once; and , as we have seen , many true ideas do not pay even once , and cannot , therefore , pay either in the long run or for some time . And , moreover , many true ideas , which do pay on one occasion , seem to pay on one occasion and one only .  And , if Professor James does not mean to assert any of these things , what is there left for him to mean ? There is left in the first place , the theory that most of our true ideas do pay; and that most of the ideas which pay are true . This seems to me to be true , and , indeed , to be all that is certainly true in what he says . But is it conceivable that this is all he has meant ? Obviously , these assertions tell us of no property at all which belongs to all true ideas , and to none but true ones; and , moreover , it seems impossible that he should have been so anxious to assert this generally admitted commonplace . What a very different complexion his whole discussion would have worn , had he merely asserted this--this quite clearly , and nothing but this , while admitting openly that many true ideas do not pay , and that many , which do pay , are not true!  And , besides this commonplace , there is only left for him to mean two one-sided and doubtful assertions to the effect that certain properties belong to none but true ideas . There is the assertion that all ideas which pay in the long run are true , and the assertion that all ideas which pay for some considerable time are true . And as to the first , it may be true; but it may also be doubted , and Professor James gives us no reason at all for thinking that it is true . Assuming that religious ideas have been useful in the past , is it quite certain that they may not permanently continue to be useful , even though they are false ? That , in short , even though they are not true , they nevertheless will be useful , not only for a time , but in the long run ? And as for the assertion that all ideas , which pay for a considerable time , are true , this is obviously more doubtful still . Whether certain religious ideas will or will not be useful in the long run , it seems difficult to doubt that many of them have been useful for a considerable time . And why should we be told dogmatically that all of these are true ? This , it seems to me , is by far the most interesting assertion , which is left for Professor James to make , when we have rejected the theory that the property of being useful belongs to all true ideas , as well as to none but true ones . But he has given no reason for asserting it . He seems , in fact , to base it merely upon the general untenable theory , that utility belongs to all true ideas , and to none but true ones; that this is what truth means .  These , then , seem to me the plainest and most obvious objections to what Professor James says about the connection between truth and utility . And there are only two further points , in what he says under this head , that I wish to notice .  In the first place , we have hitherto been considering only whether it is true , as a matter of empirical fact , that all our true ideas are useful , and those which are not true , never . Professor James seems , at least , to mean that , as a matter of fact , this is so; and I have only urged hitherto that as a matter of fact , it is not so . But as we have seen , he also asserts something more than this--he also asserts that this property of utility is the only one which belongs to all our true ideas . And this further assertion cannot possibly be true , if , as I have urged , there are many true ideas which do not possess this property; or if , as I have urged , many ideas , which do possess it , are nevertheless not true . The objections already considered are , then , sufficient to overthrow this further assertion also . If there are any true ideas , which are not useful , or if any , which are useful , are not true , it cannot be the case that utility is the only property which true ideas have in common . There must be some property , other than utility , which is common to all true ideas; and a correct theory as to what property it is that does belong to all true ideas , and to none but true ones , is still to seek . The empirical objections , hitherto given , are then sufficient objections to this further assertion also; but they are not the only objections to it . There is another and still more serious objection to the assertion that utility is the only property which all true ideas have in common . For this assertion does not merely imply that , as a matter of fact , all our true ideas and none but true ideas are useful . It does , indeed , imply this; and therefore the fact that these empirical assertions are not true is sufficient to refute it . But it also implies something more . If utility were the only property which all true ideas had in common , it would follow not merely that all true ideas are useful , but also that any idea , which was useful , would be true no matter what other properties it might have or might fail to have . There can , I think , be no doubt that Professor James does frequently speak as if this were the case; and there is an independent and still more serious objection to this implication . Even if it were true (as it is not) that all our true ideas and none but true ideas are , as a matter of fact , useful , we should still have a strong reason to object to the statement that any idea , which was useful , would be true . For it implies that if such an idea as mine , that Professor James exists , and has certain thoughts , were useful , this idea would be true , even if no such person as Professor James ever did exist . It implies that , if the idea that I had the seven of diamonds in my hand at cards last night , were useful , this idea would be true , even if , in fact , I did not have that card in my hand . And we can , I think , see quite plainly that this is not the case . With regard to some kinds of ideas , at all events--ideas with regard to the existence of other people , or with regard to past experiences of our own--it seems quite plain that they would not be true , unless they "agreed with reality" in some other sense than that which Professor James declares to be the only one in which true ideas must agree with it . Even if my idea that Professor James exists were to "agree with reality ," in the sense that , owing to it , I handled other realities better than I should have done without it , it would , I think , plainly not be true , unless Professor James really did exist--unless he were a reality . And this , I think , is one of the two most serious objections to what he seems to hold about the connection of truth with utility . He seems to hold that any idea , which was useful , would be true , no matter what other properties it might fail to have . And with regard to some ideas , at all events , it seems plain that they cannot be true , unless they have the property that what they believe to exist , really does or did exist . Beliefs in the existence of other people might be useful to me , even if I alone existed; but , nevertheless , in such a case , they would not be true .  And there is only one other point , in what Professor James says in connection with the "instrumental" view of truth , upon which I wish to remark . We have seen that he seems sometimes to hold that beliefs are true , so long as they are "profitable to our lives ." And this implies , as we have seen , the doubtful proposition than any belief which is useful for some length of time , is true . But this is not all that it implies . It also implies that beliefs are true only so long as they are profitable . Nor does Professor James appear to mean by this that they occur , only so long as they are profitable . He seems to hold , on the contrary , that beliefs , which are profitable for some time , do sometimes finally occur at a time when they are not profitable . He implies , therefore , that a belief , which occurs at several different times , may be true at some of the times at which it occurs , and yet untrue at others . I think there is no doubt that this view is what he is sometimes thinking of . And this , we see , constitutes a quite new view as to the connection between truth and utility--a view quite different from any that we have hitherto considered . This view asserts not that every true idea is useful at some time , or in the long run , or for a considerable period; but that the truth of an idea may come and go , as its utility comes and goes . It admits that one and the same idea sometimes occurs at times when it is useful , and sometimes at times when it is not; but it maintains that this same idea is true , at those times when it is useful , and not true , at those when it is not . And the fact that Professor James seems to suggest this view , constitutes , I think , a second most serious objection to what he says about the connection of truth and utility . It seems so obvious that utility is a property which comes and goes--which belongs to a given idea at one time , and does not belong to it at another , that anyone who says that the true is the useful naturally seems not to be overlooking this obvious fact , but to be suggesting that truth is a property which comes and goes in the same way . It is , in this way I think , that the "instrumental" view of truth is connected with the view that truth is "mutable ." Professor James does , I think , imply that truth is mutable in just this sense--namely , that one and the same idea may be true at some of the times at which it occurs , and not true at others , and this is the view which I have next to consider .   (II)  Professor James seems to hold , generally , that "truth" is mutable . And by this he seems sometimes to mean that an idea which , when it occurs at one time , is true , may , when it occurs at another time , not be true . He seems to hold that one and the same idea may be true at one time and false at another . That it may be , for I do not suppose he means that all ideas do actually undergo this change from true to false . Many true ideas seem to occur but once , and , if so , they , at least , will not actually be true at one time and false at another , though , even with regard to these , perhaps Professor James means to maintain that they might be false at another time , if they were to occur at it . But I am not sure that he even means to maintain this with regard to all our true ideas . Perhaps he does not mean to say , with regard to all of them , even that they can change from true to false . He speaks , generally , indeed , as if truth were mutable; but , in one passage , he seems to insist that there is a certain class of true ideas , none of which are mutable in this respect . "Relations among purely mental ideas ," he says (p . 209) , "form another sphere where true and false beliefs obtain , and here the beliefs are absolute or unconditional . When they are true they bear the name either of definitions or of principles . It is either a principle or a definition that 1 and 1 make 2 , that 2 and 1 make 3 , and so on; that white differs less from grey than it does from black; that when the cause begins to act the effect also commences . Such propositions hold of all possible 'ones ,' of all conceivable 'whites ,' 'greys ,' and 'causes .' The objects here are mental objects . Their relations are perceptually obvious at a glance , and no sense-verification is necessary . Moreover , once true , always true , of those same mental objects . Truth here has an 'eternal' character . If you can find a concrete thing anywhere that is 'one' or 'white' or 'grey' or an 'effect ,' then your principles will everlastingly apply to it ." Professor James does seem here to hold that there are true ideas , which once true , are always true . Perhaps , then , he does not hold that all true ideas are mutable . Perhaps he does not even hold that all true ideas , except ideas of this kind , are so . But he does seem to hold at least that many of our true ideas are mutable . And even this proposition seems to me to be disputable . It seems to me that there is a sense in which it is the case with every true idea that , if once true , it is always true . That is to say , that every idea , which is true once , would be true at any other time at which it were to occur; and that every idea which does occur more than once , if true once , is true at every time at which it does occur . There seems to me , I say , to be a sense in which this is so . And this seems to me to be the sense in which it is most commonly and most naturally maintained that all truths are "immutable ." Professor James seems to mean to deny it , even in this sense . He seems to me constantly to speak as if there were no sense in which all truths are immutable . And I only wish to point out what seems to me to be the plainest and most obvious objection to such language .  And , first of all , there is one doctrine , which he seems to connect with this of his that "truths are mutable ," with regard to which I fully agree with him . He seems very anxious to insist that reality is mutable: that it does change , and that it is not irrational to hope that in the future it will be different from and much better than it is now . And this seems to me to be quite undeniable . It seems to me quite certain that I do have ideas at one time which I did not have at another; that change , therefore , does really occur . It seems to me quite certain that in the future many things will be different from what they are now; and I see no reason to think that they may not be much better . There is much misery in the world now; and I think it is quite possible that some day there will really be much less . This view that reality is mutable , that facts do change , that some things have properties at one time which they do not have at other times , seems to me certainly true . And so far , therefore , as Professor James merely means to assert this obvious fact , I have no objection to his view . Some philosophers , I think , have really implied the denial of this fact . All those who deny the reality of time do seem to me to imply that nothing really changes or can change--that , in fact , reality is wholly immutable . And so far as Professor James is merely protesting against this view , I should , therefore , agree with him .  But I think it is quite plain that he does not mean merely this , when he says that truth is mutable . No one would choose this way of expressing himself if he merely meant to say that some things are mutable . Truth , Professor James has told us , is a property of certain of our ideas . And those of our ideas , which are true or false , are certainly only a part of the Universe . Other things in the Universe might , therefore , change , even if our ideas never changed in respect of this property . And our ideas themselves do undoubtedly change in some respects . A given idea exists in my mind at one moment and does not exist in it at another . At one moment it is in my mind and not in somebody else's , and at another in somebody else's and not in mine . I sometimes think of the truth that twice two are four when I am in one mood , and sometimes when I am in another . I sometimes think of it in connection with one set of ideas and sometimes in connection with another set . Ideas , then , are constantly changing in some respects . They come and go; and at one time they stand in a given relation to other things or ideas , to which at another time they do not stand in that relation . In this sense , any given idea may certainly have a property at one time which it has not got at another time . All this seems obvious; and all this cannot be admitted , without admitting that reality is mutable--that some things change . But obviously it does not seem to follow from this that there is no respect in which ideas are immutable . It does not seem to follow that because ideas , and other things , change some of their properties , they necessarily change that one which we are considering--namely , "truth ." It does not follow that a given idea , which has the property of truth at one time , ever exists at any other time without having that property . And yet that this does happen seems to be part of what is meant by saying that truth is mutable . Plainly , therefore , to say this is to say something quite different from saying that some things are mutable . Even , therefore , if we admit that some things are mutable , it is still open to consider whether truth is so . And this is what I want now to consider . Is it the case that an idea which exists at one time , and is true then , ever exists at any other time , without being true ? Is it the case that any idea ever changes from true to false ? That it has the property of being true on one of the occasions when it exists , and that it has not this property , but that of being false instead , on some other occasion when it exists ?  In order to answer this question clearly , it is , I think , necessary to make still another distinction . It does certainly seem to be true , in a sense , that a given idea may be true on one occasion and false on another . We constantly speak as if there were cases in which a given thing was true on one occasion and false on another; and I think it cannot be denied that , when we so speak , we are often expressing in a perfectly proper and legitimate manner something which is undeniably true . It is true now , I might say , that I am in this room; but to-morrow this will not be true . It is true now that men are often very miserable; but perhaps in some future state of society this will not be true . These are perfectly natural forms of expression , and what they express is something which certainly may be true . And yet what they do apparently assert is that something or other , which is true at one time , will not , or perhaps will not , be true at another . We constantly use such expressions , which imply that what is true at one time is not true at another; and it is certainly legitimate to use them . And hence , I think , we must admit that , in a sense , it is true that a thing may be true at one time which is not true at another; in that sense , namely , in which we use these expressions . And it is , I think , also plain that these things , which may be true at one time and false at another , may , in a sense , be ideas . We might even say: The idea that I am in this room , is true now; but to-morrow it will not be true . We might say this without any strain on language . In any ordinary book--indeed , in any philosophical book , where the subject we are at present discussing was not being expressly discussed--such expressions do , I think , constantly occur . And we should pass them , without any objection . We should at once understand what they meant , and treat them as perfectly natural expressions of things undeniably true . We must , then , I think , admit that , in a sense , an idea may be true at one time , and false at another . The question is: In what sense ? What is the truth for which these perfectly legitimate expressions stand ?  It seems to me that in all these cases , so far as we are not merely talking of facts , but of true ideas , that the "idea" which we truly say to be true at one time and false at another , is merely the idea of a sentence--that is , of certain words . And we do undoubtedly call words "true ." The words "I am at a meeting of the Aristotelian Society" are true , if I use them now; but if I use the same words to-morrow , they would not be true . The words "George III is king of England" were true in 1800 , but they are not true now . That is to say , a given set of words may undoubtedly be true at one time , and false at another; and since we may have ideas of words as well as of other things , we may , in this sense , say the same of certain of our "ideas ." We may say that some of our "ideas" (namely those of words) are true at one time and not true at another .  But is it conceivable that Professor James merely meant to assert that the same words are sometimes true at one time and false at another ? Can this be all he means by saying that truth is mutable ? I do not think it can possibly be so . No one , I think , in definitely discussing the mutability of truth , could say that true ideas were mutable , and yet mean (although he did not say so) that this proposition applied solely to ideas of words . Professor James must , I think , have been sometimes thinking that other ideas , and not merely ideas of words , do sometimes change from true to false . And this is the proposition which I am concerned to dispute . It seems to me that if we mean by an idea , not merely the idea of certain words , but the kind of idea which words express , it is very doubtful whether such an idea ever changes from true to false--whether any such idea is ever true at one time and false at another .  And plainly , in the first place , the mere fact that the same set of words , as in the instances I have given , really are true at one time and false at another , does not afford any presumption that anything which they stand for is true at one time and false at another . For the same words may obviously be used in different senses at different times; and hence though the same words , which formerly expressed a truth , may cease to express one , that may be because they now express a different idea , and not because the idea which they formerly expressed has ceased to be true . And that , in instances such as I have given , the words do change their meaning according to the time at which they are uttered or thought of , is I think , evident . If I use now the words "I am in this room ," these words certainly express (among other things) the idea that my being in this room is contemporary with my present use of the words; and if I were to use the same words to-morrow , they would express the idea that my being in this room to-morrow , was contemporary with the use of them then . And since my use of them then would not be the same fact as my use of them now , they would certainly then express a different idea from that which they express now . And in general , whenever we use the present tense in its primary sense , it seems to me plain that we do mean something different by it each time we use it . We always mean (among other things) to express the idea that a given event is contemporary with our actual use of it; and since our actual use of it on one occasion is always a different fact from our actual use of it on another , we express by it a different idea each time we use it . And similarly with the past and future tenses . If anybody had said in 1807 "Napoleon is dead ," he would certainly have meant by these words something different from what I mean by them when I use them now . He would have meant that Napoleon's death occurred at a time previous to his use of those words; and this would not have been true . But in this fact there is nothing to show that if he had meant by them what I mean now , his idea would not have been as true then as mine is now . And so , if I say "It will rain to-morrow ," these words have a different meaning to-day from what they would have if I used them to-morrow . What we mean by "to-morrow" is obviously a different day , when we use the word on one day , from what we mean by it when we use it on another . But in this there is nothing to show that if the idea , which I now mean by "It will rain to-morrow ," were to occur again to-morrow , it would not be true then , if it is true now . All this is surely very obvious . But , if we take account of it , and if we concentrate our attention not on the words but on what is meant by them , is it so certain that what we mean by them on any one occasion ever changes from true to false ? If there were to occur to me to-morrow the very same idea which I now express by the words "I am in this room ," is it certain that this idea would not be as true then as it is now ? It is perhaps true that the whale of what I mean by such a phrase as this never does recur . But part of it does , and that a part which is true . Part of what I mean is Certainly identical with part of what I should mean to-morrow by saying "I was in that room last night ." And this part would be as true then , as it is now . And is there any part , which , if it were to recur at any time , would not then be true , though it Is true now ? In the case of all ideas or parts of ideas , which ever do actually recur , can we find a single instance of one , which is plainly true at one of the times when it occurs , and yet not true at another ? I cannot think of any such instance . And on the other hand this very proposition that any idea (other than mere words) which is true once , would be true at any time , seems to me to be one of those truths of which Professor James has spoken as having an "eternal ," "absolute ," "unconditional" character--as being "perceptually obvious at a glance" and needing "no sense-verification ." Just as we know that , if a particular colour differs more from black than from grey at one time , the same colour would differ more from black than from grey at any time , so , it seems to me , we can see that , if a particular idea is true at one time , the same idea would be true at any time .  It seems to me , then , that if we mean by an idea , not mere words , but the kind of idea which words express , any idea , which is true at one time when it occurs , would be true at any time when it were to occur; and that this is so , even though it is an idea , which refers to facts which are mutable . My being in this room is a fact which is now , but which certainly has not been at every time and will not be at every time . And the words "I am in this room ," though they express a truth now , would not have expressed one if I had used them yesterday , and will not if I use them to-morrow . But if we consider the idea which these words now express--namely , the idea of the connection of my being in this room with this particular time--it seems to me evident that anybody who had thought of that connection at any time in the past , would have been thinking truly , and that anybody who were to think of it at any time in the future would be thinking truly . This seems to me to be the sense in which truths are immutable--in which no idea can change from true to false . And I think Professor James means to deny of truths generally , if not of all truths , that they are immutable even in this sense . If he does not mean this there seems nothing left for him to mean , when he says that truths are mutable , except (1) that some facts are mutable , and (2) that the same words may be true at one time and false at another . And it seems to me impossible that he could speak as he does , if he meant nothing more than these two things . I believe , therefore , that he is really thinking that ideas which have been once true (ideas , and not merely words) do sometimes afterwards become false: that the very same idea is at one time true and at another false . But he certainly gives no instance which shows that this does ever occur . And how far does he mean his principle to carry him ? Does he hold that this idea that Julius Caesar was murdered in the Senate-House , though true now , may , at some future time cease to be true , if it should be more profitable to the lives of future generations to believe that he died in his bed ? Things like this are what his words seem to imply; and , even if he does hold that truths like this are not mutable , he never tries to tell us to what kinds of truths he would limit mutability , nor how they differ from such as this .   (III)  Finally , there remains the view that "to an unascertainable extent our truths are man-made products ." And the only point I want to make about this view may be put very briefly .  It is noticeable that all the instances which Professor James gives of the ways in which , according to him , "our truths" are "made" are instances of ways in which our beliefs come into existence . In many of these ways , it would seem , false beliefs sometimes come into existence as well as true ones; and I take it Professor James does not always wish to deny this . False beliefs , I think he would say , are just as much "man-made products" as true ones: it is sufficient for his purpose if true beliefs do come into existence in the ways he mentions . And the only point which seems to be illustrated by all these instances , is that in all of them the existence of a true belief does depend in some way or other upon the previous existence of something in some man's mind . They are all of them cases in which we may truly say: This man would not have had just that belief , had not some man previously had such and such experiences , or interests , or purposes . In some cases they are instances of ways in which the existence of a particular belief in a man depends upon his own previous experiences or interests or volitions . But this does not seem to be the case in all . Professor James seems also anxious to illustrate the point that one man's beliefs often depend upon the previous experiences or interests or volitions of other men . And , as I say , the only point which seems to be definitely illustrated in all cases is that the existence of a true belief does depend , in some way or other , upon something which has previously existed in some man's mind . Almost any kind of dependence , it would seem , is sufficient to illustrate Professor James' point .  And as regards this general thesis that almost all our beliefs , true as well as false , depend , in some way or other , upon what has previously been in some human mind , it will , I think , be readily admitted . It is a commonplace , which , so far as I know , hardly anyone would deny . If this is all that is to be meant by saying that our true beliefs are "man-made ," it must , I think , be admitted that almost all , If not quite all , really are man-made . And this is all that Professor James' instances seem to me , in fact , to show .  But is this all that Professor James means , when he says that our truths are man-made ? Is it conceivable that he only means to insist upon this undeniable , and generally admitted , commonplace ? It seems to me quite plain that this is not all that he means . I think he certainly means to suggest that , from the fact that we "make" our true beliefs , something else follows . And I think it is not hard to see one thing more which he does mean . I think he certainly means to suggest that we not only make our true beliefs , but also that we make them true . At least as much as this is certainly naturally suggested by his words . No one would persistently say that we make our truths , unless he meant , at least , not merely that we make our true beliefs , but also that we make them true--unless he meant not merely that the existence of our true beliefs , but also that their truth , depended upon human conditions . This , it seems to me , is one consequence which Professor James means us to draw from the commonplace that the existence of our true beliefs depends upon human conditions . But does this consequence , in fact , follow from that commonplace ? From the fact that we make our true beliefs , does it follow that we make them true ?  In one sense , undoubtedly , even this does follow . If we say (as we may say) that no belief can be true , unless it exists , then it follows that , in a sense , the truth of a belief must always depend upon any conditions upon which its existence depends . If , therefore , the occurrence of a belief depends upon human conditions , so , too , must its truth . If the belief had never existed , it would never have been true; and therefore its truth must , in a sense , depend upon human conditions in exactly the same degree in which its existence depends upon them . This is obvious . But is this all that is meant ? Is this all that would be suggested to us by telling us that we make our beliefs true ?  It is easy to see that it is not . I may have the belief that it will rain to-morrow . And I may have "made" myself have this belief . It may be the case that I should not have had it , but for peculiarities in my past experiences , in my interests and my volitions . It may be the case that I should not have had it , but for a deliberate attempt to consider the question whether it will rain or not . This may easily happen . And certainly this particular belief of mine would not have been true , unless it existed . Its truth , therefore , depends , in a sense , upon any conditions upon which its existence depends . And this belief may be true . It will be true , if It does rain to-morrow . But , in spite of all these reasons , would anyone think of saying that , in case it is true , I had made it true ? Would anyone say that I had had any hand at all in making it true ? Plainly no one would . We should say that I had a hand in making it true , if and only If I had a hand in making the rain fall . In every case in which we believe in the existence of anything , past or future , we should say that we had helped to make the belief true , if and only if we had helped to cause the existence of the fact which , in that belief , we believed did exist or would exist . Surely this is plain . I may believe that the sun will rise to-morrow . And I may have had a hand in "making" this belief; certainly it often depends for its existence upon what has been previously in my mind . And if the sun does rise , my belief will have been true . I have , therefore , had a hand in making a true belief . But would anyone say that , therefore , I had a hand in making this belief true ? Certainly no one would . No one would say that anything had contributed to make this belief true , except those conditions (whatever they may be) which contributed to making the sun actually rise .  It is plain , then , that by "making a belief true ," we mean something quite different from what Professor James means by "making" that belief . Conditions which have a hand in making a given true belief , may (it appears) have no hand at all in making it true; and conditions which have a hand in making it true may have no hand at all in making it . Certainly this is how we use the words . We should never say that we had made a belief true , merely because we had made the belief . But now , which of these two things does Professor James mean ? Does he mean merely the accepted commonplace that we make our true beliefs , in the sense that almost all of them depend for their existence on what has been previously in some human mind ? Or does he mean also that we make them true--that their truth also depends on what has been previously in some human mind ?  I cannot help thinking that he has the latter , and not only the former in his mind . But , then , what does this involve ? If his instances of "truth-making" are to be anything to the purpose , it should mean that , whenever I have a hand in causing one of my own beliefs , I always have to that extent a hand in making it true . That , therefore , I have a hand in actually making the sun rise , the wind blow , and the rain fall , whenever I cause my beliefs in these things . Nay , more , it should mean that , whenever I "make" a true belief about the past , I must have had a hand in making this true . And if so , then certainly I must have had a hand in causing the French Revolution , in causing my father's birth , in making Professor James write this book . Certainly he implies that some man or other must have helped in causing almost every event , in which any man ever truly believed . That it was we who made the planets revolve round the sun , who made the Alps rise , and the floor of the Pacific sink--all these things , and others like them , seem to be involved . And it is these consequences which seem to me to justify a doubt whether , in fact "our truths are to an unascertainable extent man-made ." That some of our truths are man-made--indeed , a great many--I fully admit . We certainly do make some of our beliefs true . The Secretary probably had a belief that I should write this paper , and I have made his belief true by writing it . Men certainly have the power to alter the world to a certain extent; and , so far as they do this , they certainly "make true" any beliefs , which are beliefs in the occurrence of these alterations . But I can see no reason for supposing that they "make true" nearly all those of their beliefs which are true . And certainly the only reason which Professor James seems to give for believing this--namely , that the existence of almost all their beliefs depends on them--seems to be no reason for it at all . For unquestionably a man does not "make true" nearly every belief whose existence depends on him; and if so , the question which of their beliefs and how many , men do "make true" must be settled by quite other considerations .  In conclusion , I wish to sum up what seems to me to be the most important points about this "pragmatist theory of truth ," as Professor James represents it . It seems to me that , in what he says about it , he has in his mind some things which are true and others which are false; and I wish to tabulate separately the principal ones which I take to be true , and the principal ones which I take to be false . The true ones seem to me to be these:--  That most of our true beliefs are useful to us; and that most of the beliefs that are useful to us are true .  That the world really does change in some respects; that facts exist at one time , which didn't and won't exist at others; and that hence the world may be better at some future time than it is now or has been in the past .   That the very same words may be true at one time and false at another--that they may express a truth at one time and a falsehood at another .  That the existence of most , if not all , of our beliefs , true as well as false , does depend upon previous events in our mental history; that we should never have had the particular beliefs we do have , had not our previous mental history been such as it was .  That the truth , and not merely the existence , of some of our beliefs , does depend upon us . That we really do make some alterations in the world , and that hence we do help to "make true" all those of our beliefs which are beliefs in the existence of these alterations .   To all of these propositions I have no objection to offer . And they seem to me to be generally admitted commonplaces . A certain class of philosophers do , indeed , imply the denial of every one of them--namely , those philosophers who deny the reality of time . And I think that part of Professor James' object is to protest against the views of these philosophers . All of these propositions do constitute a protest against such views; and so far they might be all that Professor James meant to assert . But I do not think that anyone , fairly reading through what he says , could get the impression that these things , and nothing more , were what he had in his mind . What gives colour and interest to what he says , seems to be obviously something quite different . And , if we try to find out what exactly the chief things are which give his discussion its colour and interest , it seems to me we may distinguish that what he has in his mind , wrapped up in more or less ambiguous language , are the following propositions , to all of which I have tried to urge what seem to me the most obvious objections:--   That utility is a property which distinguishes true beliefs from those which are not true; that , therefore , all true beliefs are useful , and all beliefs , which are useful , are true--by "utility" being sometimes meant "utility on at least one occasion ," sometimes "utility in the long run ," sometimes "utility for some length of time ."  That all beliefs which are useful for some length of time are true .  That utility is the only property which all true beliefs have in common: that , therefore , if it were useful to me to believe in Professor James' existence , this belief would be true , even if he didn't exist; and that , if it were not useful to me to believe this , the belief would be false , even if he did .  That the beliefs , which we express by words , and not merely the words themselves , may be true at one time and not true at another; and that this is a general rule , though perhaps there may be some exceptions .  That whenever the existence of a belief depends to some extent on us , then also the truth of that belief depends to some extent on us; in the sense in which this implies , that , when the existence of my belief that a shower will fall depends upon me , then , if this belief is true , I must have had a hand in making the shower fall: that , therefore , men must have had a hand in making to exist almost every fact which they ever believe to exist .   [1] Pragmatism: A New Name for some Old Ways of Thinking: Popular Lectures on Philosophy . By William James . Longmans , Green , and Co . , 1907     HUME'S PHILOSOPHY   In both of his two books on the Human Understanding , Hume had , I think , one main general object . He tells us that it was his object to discover "the extent and force of human understanding ," to give us "an exact analysis of its powers and capacity ." And we may , I think , express what he meant by this in the following way . He plainly held (as we all do) that some men sometimes entertain opinions which they cannot know to be true . And he wished to point out what characteristics are possessed by those of our opinions which we can know to be true , with a view of persuading us that any opinion which does not possess any of these characteristics is of a kind which we cannot know to be so . He thus tries to lay down certain rules to the effect that the only propositions which we can , any of us , know to be true are of certain definite kinds . It is in this sense , I think , that he tries to define the limits of human understanding .  With this object he , first of all , divides all the propositions , which we can even so much as conceive , into two classes . They are all , he says , either propositions about "relations of ideas" or else about "matters of fact ." By propositions about "relations of ideas" he means such propositions as that twice two are four , or that black differs from white; and it is , I think , easy enough to see , though by no means easy to define , what kind of propositions it is that he means to include in this division . They are , he says , the only kind of propositions with regard to which we can have "intuitive" or "demonstrative" certainty . But the vast majority of the propositions in which we believe and which interest us most , belong to the other division: they are propositions about "matters of fact ." And these again he divides into two classes . So far as his words go , this latter division is between "matters of fact , beyond the present testimony of our senses , or the records of our memory ," on the one hand , and matters of fact for which we have the evidence of our memory or senses , on the other . But it is , I think , quite plain that these words do not represent quite accurately the division which he really means to make . He plainly intends to reckon along with facts for which we have the evidence of our senses all facts for which we have the evidence of direct observation--such facts , for instance , as those which I observe when I observe that I am angry or afraid , and which cannot be strictly said to be apprehended by my senses . The division , then , which he really intends to make is (to put it quite strictly) into the two classes--(1) propositions which assert some matter of fact which I am (in the strictest sense) observing at the moment , or which I have so observed in the past and now remember; and (2) propositions which assert any matter of fact which I am not now observing and never have observed , or , if I have , have quite forgotten .  We have , then , the three classes--(1) propositions which assert "relations of ideas"; (2) propositions which assert "matters of fact" for which we have the evidence of direct observation or personal memory; (3) propositions which assert "matters of fact" for which we have not this evidence . And as regards propositions of the first two classes , Hume does not seem to doubt our capacity for knowledge . He does not doubt that we can know some (though , of course , not all) propositions about "relations of ideas" to be true; he never doubts , for instance , that we can know that twice two are four . And he generally assumes also that each of us can know the truth of all propositions which merely assert some matter of fact which we ourselves are , in the strictest sense , directly observing , or which we have so observed and now remember . He does , indeed , in one place , suggest a doubt whether our memory is ever to be implicitly trusted , but he generally assumes that it always can . It is with regard to propositions of the third class that he is chiefly anxious to determine which of them (if any) we can know to be true and which not . In what cases can any man know any matter of fact which he himself has not directly observed ? It is Hume's views on this question which form , I think , the main interest of his philosophy .  He proposes , first of all , by way of answer to it , a rule , which may , I think , be expressed as follows: No man , he says , can ever know any matter of fact , which he has not himself observed , unless he can know that it is connected by "the relation of cause and effect ," with some fact which he has observed . And no man can ever know that any two facts are connected by this relation , except by the help of his own past experience . In other words , if I am to know any fact , A , which I have not myself observed , my past experience must give me some foundation for the belief that A is causally connected with some fact , B , which I have observed . And the only kind of past experience which can give me any foundation for such a belief is , Hume seems to say , as follows: I must , he says , have found facts like A "constantly conjoined" in the past with facts like B . This is what he says; but we must not , I think , press his words too strictly . I may , for instance , know that A is probably a fact , even where the conjunction of facts like it with facts like B has not been quite constant . Or instead of observing facts like A conjoined with facts like B , I may have observed a whole series of conjunctions--for instance , between A and C , C and D , D and E , and E and B; and such a series , however long , will do quite as well to establish a causal connection between A and B , as if I had directly observed conjunctions between A and B themselves . Such modifications as this , Hume would , I think , certainly allow . But , allowing for them , his principle is , I think , quite clear . I can , he holds , never know any fact whatever , which I have not myself observed , unless I have observed similar facts in the past and have observed that they were "conjoined" (directly or indirectly) with facts similar to some fact which I do now observe or remember . In this sense , he holds , all our knowledge of facts , beyond the reach of our own observation , is founded on experience .  This is Hume's primary principle . But what consequences does he think will follow from it , as to the kind of facts , beyond our own observation , which we can know ? We may , I think , distinguish three entirely different views as to its consequences , which he suggests in different parts of his work .  In the first place , where he is specially engaged in explaining this primary principle , he certainly seems to suppose that all propositions of the kind , which we assume most universally in everyday life , may be founded on experience in the sense required . He supposes that we have this foundation in experience for such beliefs as that "a stone will fall , or fire burn"; that Julius Caesar was murdered; that the sun will rise to-morrow; that all men are mortal He speaks as if experience did not merely render such beliefs probable , but actually proved them to be true . The "arguments from experience" in their favour are , he says , such as "leave no room for doubt or opposition ." The only kinds of belief , which he definitely mentions as not founded on experience , are "popular superstitions" on the one hand , and certain religious and philosophical beliefs , on the other . He seems to suppose that a few (a very few) religious beliefs may , perhaps , be founded on experience . But as regards most of the specific doctrines of Christianity , for example , he seems to be clear that they are not so founded . The belief in miracles is not founded on experience; nor is the philosophical belief that every event is caused by the direct volition of the Deity . In short , it would seem , that in this doctrine that our knowledge of unobserved facts is confined to such as are "founded on experience ," he means to draw the line very much where it is drawn by the familiar doctrine which is called "Agnosticism ." We can know such facts as are asserted in books on "history , geography or astronomy ," or on "politics , physics and chemistry ," because such assertions may be "founded on experience"; but we cannot know the greater part of the facts asserted in books "of divinity or school metaphysics ," because such assertions have no foundation in experience .  This , I think , was clearly one of Hume's views . He meant to fix the limits of our knowledge at a point which would exclude most religious propositions and a great many philosophical ones , as incapable of being known; but which would include all the other kinds of propositions , which are most universally accepted by common-sense , as capable of being known . And he thought that , so far as matters of fact beyond the reach of our personal observation are concerned , this point coincided with that at which the possibility of "foundation on experience" ceases .  But , if we turn to another part of his work , we find a very different view suggested . In a quite distinct section of both his books , he investigates the beliefs which we entertain concerning the existence of "external objects ." And he distinguishes two different kinds of belief which may be held on this subject . "Almost all mankind , and philosophers themselves , for the greatest part of their lives ," believe , he says , that "the very things they feel and see" are external objects , in the sense that they continue to exist , even when we cease to feel or see them . Philosophers , on the other hand , have been led to reject this opinion and to suppose (when they reflect) that what we actually perceive by the senses never exists except when we perceive it , but that there are other external objects , which do exist independently of us , and which cause us to perceive what we do perceive . Hume investigates both of these opinions , at great length in the Treatise , and much more briefly in the Enquiry , and comes to the conclusion , in both books , that neither of them can be "founded on experience ," in the sense he has defined . As regards the first of them , the vulgar opinion , he does seem to admit in the Treatise that it is , in a sense , founded on experience; but not , he insists , in the sense defined . And he seems also to think that , apart from this fact , there are conclusive reasons for holding that the opinion cannot be true . And as regards the philosophical opinion , he says that any belief in external objects , which we never perceive but which cause our perceptions , cannot possibly be founded on experience , for the simple reason that if it were , we should need to have directly observed some of these objects and their "conjunction" with what we do perceive , which ex hypothesi , we cannot have done , since we never do directly observe any external object .  Hume , therefore , concludes , in this part of his work , that we cannot know of the existence of any "external object" whatever . And though in all that he says upon this subject , he is plainly thinking only of material objects , the principles by which he tries to prove that we cannot know these must , I think , prove equally well that we cannot know any "external object" whatever--not even the existence of any other human mind . His argument is: We cannot directly observe any object whatever , except such as exist only when we observe them; we cannot , therefore , observe any "constant conjunctions" except between objects of this kind: and hence we can have no foundation in experience for any proposition which asserts the existence of any other kind of object , and cannot , therefore , know any such proposition to be true . And this argument must plainly apply to all the feelings , thoughts and perceptions of other men just as much as to material objects . I can never know that any perception of mine , or anything which I do observe , must have been caused by any other man , because I can never directly observe a "constant conjunction" between any other man's thoughts or feelings or intentions and anything which I directly observe: I cannot , therefore , know that any other man ever had any thoughts or feelings--or , in short , that any man beside myself ever existed . The view , therefore , which Hume suggests in this part of his work , flatly contradicts the view which he at first seemed to hold . He now says we cannot know that a stone will fall , that fire will burn , or the sun will rise to-morrow . All that I can possibly know , according to his present principles , is that I shall see a stone fall , shall feel the fire burn , shall see the sun rise to-morrow . I cannot even know that any other men will see these things; for I cannot know that any other men exist . For the same reason , I cannot know that Julius Caesar was murdered , or that all men are mortal . For these are propositions asserting "external" facts--facts which don't exist only at the moment when I observe them; and , according to his present doctrine , I cannot possibly know any such proposition to be true . No man , in short , can know any proposition about "matters of fact" to be true , except such as merely assert something about his own states of mind , past , present or future--about these or about what he himself has directly observed , is observing , or will observe .  Here , therefore , we have a very different view suggested , as to the limits of human knowledge . And even this is not all . There is yet a third view , inconsistent with both of these , which Hume suggests in some parts of his work .  So far as we have yet seen , he has not in any way contradicted his original supposition that we can know some matters of fact , which we have never ourselves observed . In the second theory , which I have just stated , he does not call in question the view that I can know all such matters of fact as I know to be causally connected with facts which I have observed , nor the view that I can know some facts to be thus causally connected . All that he has done is to question whether I can know any external fact to be causally connected with anything which I observe; he would still allow that I may be able to know that future states of my own , or past states , which I have forgotten , are causally connected with those which I now observe or remember; and that I may know therefore , in some cases , what I shall experience in the future , or have experienced in the past but have now forgotten . But in some parts of his work he does seem to question whether any man can know even as much as this: he seems to question whether we can ever know any fact whatever to be causally connected with any other fact . For , after laying it down , as we saw above , that we cannot know any fact , A , to be causally connected with another , B , unless we have experienced in the past a constant conjunction between facts like A and facts like B , he goes on to ask what foundation we have for the conclusion that A and B are causally connected , even when we have in the past experienced a constant conjunction between them . He points out that from the fact that A has been constantly conjoined with B in the past , it does not follow that it ever will be so again . It does not follow , therefore , that the two really are causally connected in the sense that , when the one occurs , the other always will occur also . And he concludes , for this and other reasons , that no argument can assure us that , because they have been constantly conjoined in the past , therefore they really are causally connected . What , then , he asks , is the foundation for such an inference ? Custom , he concludes , is the only foundation . It is nothing but custom which induces us to believe that , because two facts have been constantly conjoined on many occasions , therefore they will be so on all occasions . We have , therefore , no better foundation than custom for any conclusion whatever as to facts which we have not observed . And can we be said really to know any fact , for which we have no better foundation than this ? Hume himself , it must be observed , never says that we can't . But he has been constantly interpreted as if the conclusion that we can't really know any one fact to be causally connected with any other , did follow from this doctrine of his . And there is , I think , certainly much excuse for this interpretation in the tone in which he speaks . He does seem to suggest that a belief which is merely founded on custom , can scarcely be one which we know to be true . And , indeed , he owns himself that , when he considers that this is our only foundation for any such belief , he is sometimes tempted to doubt whether we do know any fact whatever , except those which we directly observe . He does , therefore , at least suggest the view that every man's knowledge is entirely confined to those facts , which he is directly observing at the moment , or which he has observed in the past , and now remembers . We see , then , that Hume suggests , at least , three entirely different views as to the consequences of his original doctrine . His original doctrine was that , as regards matters of fact beyond the reach of our own actual observation , the knowledge of each of us is strictly limited to those for which we have a basis in our own experience . And his first view as to the consequences of this doctrine was that it does show us to be incapable of knowing a good many religious and philosophical propositions , which many men have claimed that they knew; but that it by no means denies our capacity of knowing the vast majority of facts beyond our own observation , which we all commonly suppose that we know . His second view , on the other hand , is that it cuts off at once all possibility of our knowing the vast majority of these facts; since he implies that we cannot have any basis in experience for asserting any external fact whatever--any fact , that is , except facts relating to our own actual past and future observations . And his third view is more sceptical still , since it suggests that we cannot really know any fact whatever , beyond the reach of our present observation or memory , even where we have a basis in experience for such a fact: it suggests that experience cannot ever let us know that any two things are causally connected , and therefore that it cannot give us knowledge of any fact based on this relation . What are we to think of these three views , and of the original doctrine from which Hume seems to infer them ? As regards the last two views , it may perhaps be thought that they are too absurd to deserve any serious consideration . It is , in fact , absurd to suggest that I do not know any external facts whatever; that I do not know , for instance , even that there are any men beside myself . And Hume himself , it might seem , does not seriously expect or wish us to accept these views . He points out , with regard to all such excessively sceptical opinions that we cannot continue to believe them for long together--that , at least , we cannot , for long together , avoid believing things flatly inconsistent with them . The philosopher may believe , when he is philosophising , that no man knows of the existence of any other man or of any material object; but at other times he will inevitably believe , as we all do , that he does know of the existence of this man and of that , and even of this and that material object . There can , therefore , be no question of making all our beliefs consistent with such views as this of never believing anything that is inconsistent with them . And it may , therefore , seem useless to discuss them . But in fact , it by no means follows that , because we are not able to adhere consistently to a given view , therefore that view is false; nor does it follow that we may not sincerely believe it , whenever we are philosophising , even though the moment we cease to philosophise , or even before , we may be forced to contradict it . And philosophers do , in fact , sincerely believe such things as this--things which flatly contradict the vast majority of the things which they believe at other times . Even Hume , I think , does sincerely wish to persuade us that we cannot know of the existence of external material objects--that this is a philosophic truth , which we ought , if we can , so long as we are philosophising , to believe . Many people , I think , are certainly tempted , in their philosophic moments , to believe such things; and , since this is so , it is , I think , worth while to consider seriously what arguments can be brought against such views . It is worth while to consider whether they are views which we ought to hold as philosophical opinions , even if it be quite certain that we shall never be able to make the views which we entertain at other times consistent with them . And it is the more worth while , because the question how we can prove or disprove such extreme views as these , has a bearing on the question how we can , in any case whatever , prove or disprove that we do really know , what we suppose ourselves to know . What arguments , then , are there for or against the extreme view that no man can know any external fact whatever; and the still more extreme view that no man can know any matter of fact whatever , except those which he is directly observing at the moment , or has observed in the past and now remembers ? It may be pointed out , in the first place , that , if these views are true , then at least no man can possibly know them to be so . What these views assert is that I cannot know any external fact whatever . It follows , therefore , that I cannot know that there are any other men , beside myself , and that they are like me in this respect . Any philosopher who asserts positively that other men , equally with himself , are incapable of knowing any external facts , is , in that very assertion , contradicting himself , since he implies that he does know a great many facts about the knowledge of other men . No one , therefore , can be entitled to assert positively that human knowledge is limited in this way , since , in asserting it positively , he is implying that his own knowledge is not so limited . It cannot be proper , even in our philosophic moments , to take up such an attitude as this . No one , therefore , can know positively that men in general , are incapable of knowing external facts . But still , although we cannot know it , it remains possible that the view should be a true one . Nay , more , it remains possible that a man should know that he himself is incapable of knowing any external facts , and that , if there are any other men whose faculties are only similar to his own , they also must be incapable of knowing any . The argument just used obviously does not apply against such a position as this . It only applies against the position that men in general positively are incapable of knowing external facts: it does not apply against the position that the philosopher himself is incapable of knowing any , or against the position that there are possibly other men in the same case , and that , if their faculties are similar to the philosopher's , they certainly would be in it . I do not contradict myself by maintaining positively that I know no external facts , though I do contradict myself if I maintain that I am only one among other men , and that no man knows any external facts . So far , then , as Hume merely maintains that he is incapable of knowing any external facts , and that there may be other men like him in this respect , the argument just used is not valid against his position . Can any conclusive arguments be found against it ? It seems to me that such a position must , in a certain sense , be quite incapable of disproof . So much must be granted to any sceptic who feels inclined to hold it . Any valid argument which can be brought against it must be of the nature of a petitio principii: it must beg the question at issue . How is the sceptic to prove to himself that he does know any external facts ? He can only do it by bringing forward some instance of an external fact , which he does know; and , in assuming that he does know this one , he is , of course , begging the question . It is therefore quite impossible for any one to prove , in one strict sense of the term , that he does know any external facts . I can only prove that I do , by assuming that in some particular instance , I actually do know one . That is to say , the so-called proof must assume the very thing which it pretends to prove . The only proof that we do know external facts lies in the simple fact that we do know them . And the sceptic can , with perfect internal consistency , deny that he does know any . But it can , I think , be shown that he has no reason for denying it . And in particular it may , I think , be easily seen that the arguments which Hume uses in favour of this position have no conclusive force . To begin with , his arguments , in both cases , depend upon the two original assumptions , (1) that we cannot know any fact , which we have not observed , unless we know it to be causally connected with some fact which we have observed , and (2) that we have no reason for assuming any causal connection , except where we have experienced some instances of conjunction between the two facts connected . And both of these assumptions may , of course , be denied . It is just as easy to deny them , as to deny that I do know any external facts . And , if these two assumptions did really lead to the conclusion that I cannot know any , it would , I think , be proper to deny them: we might fairly regard the fact that they led to this absurd conclusion as disproving them . But , in fact , I think it may be easily seen that they do not lead to it . Let us consider , first of all , Hume's most sceptical argument (the argument which he merely suggests) . This argument suggests that , since our only reason for supposing two facts to be causally connected is that we have found them constantly conjoined in the past , and since it does not follow from the fact that they have been conjoined ever so many times , that they always will be so , therefore we cannot know that they always will be so , and hence cannot know that they are causally connected . But obviously the conclusion does not follow . We must , I think , grant the premiss that , from the fact that two things have been conjoined , no matter how often , it does not strictly follow that they always are conjoined . But it by no means follows from this that we may not know that , as a matter of fact , when two things are conjoined sufficiently often , they are also always conjoined . We may quite well know many things which do not logically follow from anything else which we know . And so , in this case , we may know that two things are causally connected , although this does not logically follow from our past experience , nor yet from anything else that we know . And , as for the contention that our belief in causal connections is merely based on custom , we may , indeed , admit that custom would not be a sufficient reason for concluding the belief to be true . But the mere fact (if it be a fact) that the belief is only caused by custom , is also no sufficient reason for concluding that we can not know it to be true . Custom may produce beliefs , which we do know to be true , even though it be admitted that it does not necessarily produce them . And as for Hume's argument to prove that we can never know any external object to be causally connected with anything which we actually observe , it is , I think , obviously fallacious . In order to prove this , he has , as he recognises , to disprove both of two theories . He has , first of all , to disprove what he calls the vulgar theory--the theory that we can know the very things which we see or feel to be external objects; that is to say , can know that these very things exist at times when we do not observe them . And even here , I think , his arguments are obviously inconclusive . But we need not stay to consider them , because , in order to prove that we cannot know any external objects , he has also to disprove what he calls the philosophic theory--the theory that we can know things which we do observe , to be caused by external objects which we never observe . If , therefore , his attempt to disprove this theory fails , his proof that we cannot know any external objects also fails; and I think it is easy to see that his disproof does fail . It amounts merely to this: That we cannot , ex hypothesi , ever observe these supposed external objects , and therefore cannot observe them to be constantly conjoined with any objects which we do observe . But what follows from this ? His own theory about the knowledge of causal connection is not that in order to know A to be the cause of B , we must have observed A itself to be conjoined with B; but only that we must have observed objects like A to be constantly conjoined with objects like B . And what is to prevent an external object from being like some object which we have formerly observed ? Suppose I have frequently observed a fact like A to be conjoined with a fact like B: and suppose I now observe B , on an occasion when I do not observe anything like A . There is no reason , on Hume's principles , why I should not conclude that A does exist on this occasion , even though I do not observe it; and that it is , therefore , an external object . It will , of course , differ from any object which I have ever observed , in respect of the simple fact that it is not observed by me , whereas they were . There is , therefore , this one respect in which it must be unlike anything which I have ever observed . But Hume has never said anything to show that unlikeness in this single respect is sufficient to invalidate the inference . It may quite well be like objects which I have observed in all other respects; and this degree of likeness may , according to his principles , be quite sufficient to justify us in concluding its existence . In short , when Hume argues that we cannot possibly learn by experience of the existence of any external objects , he is , I think , plainly committing the fallacy of supposing that , because we cannot , ex hypothesis have ever observed any object which actually is "external ," therefore we can never have observed any object like an external one . But plainly we may have observed objects like them in all respects except the single one that these have been observed whereas the others have not . And even a less degree of likeness than this would , according to his principles , be quite sufficient to justify an inference of causal connection . Hume does not , therefore , bring forward any arguments at all sufficient to prove either that he cannot know any one object to be causally connected with any other or that he cannot know any external fact . And , indeed , I think it is plain that no conclusive argument could possibly be advanced in favour of these positions . It would always be at least as easy to deny the argument as to deny that we do know external facts . We may , therefore , each one of us , safely conclude that we do know external facts; and , if we do , then there is no reason why we should not also know that other men do the same . There is no reason why we should not , in this respect , make our philosophical opinions agree with what we necessarily believe at other times . There is no reason why I should not confidently assert that I do really know some external facts , although I cannot prove the assertion except by simply assuming that I do . I am , in fact , as certain of this as of anything; and as reasonably certain of it . But just as I am certain that I do know some external facts , so I am also certain that there are others which I do not know . And the question remains: Does the line between the two fall , where Hume says it falls ? Is it true that the only external facts I know are facts for which I have a basis in my own experience ? And that I cannot know any facts whatever , beyond the reach of my own observation and memory , except those for which I have such a basis ? This , it seems to me , is the most serious question which Hume raises . And it should be observed that his own attitude towards it is very different from his attitude towards the sceptical views which we have just been considering . These sceptical views he did not expect or wish us to accept , except in philosophic moments . He declares that we cannot , in ordinary life , avoid believing things which are inconsistent with them; and , in so declaring , he , of course , implies incidentally that they are false: since he implies that he himself has a great deal of knowledge as to what we can and cannot believe in ordinary life . But , as regards the view that our knowledge of matters of fact beyond our own observation is entirely confined to such as are founded on experience , he never suggests that it is impossible that all our beliefs should be consistent with this view , and he does seem to think it eminently desirable that they should be . He declares that any assertion with regard to such matters , which is not founded on experience , can be nothing but "sophistry and illusion"; and that all books which are composed of such assertions should be "committed to the flames ." He seems , therefore , to think that here we really have a test by which we may determine what we should or should not believe , on all occasions: any view on such matters , for which we have no foundation in experience , is a view which we cannot know to be even probably true , and which we should never accept , if we can help it . Is there any justification for this strong view ? It is , of course , abstractly possible that we do really know , without the help of experience , some matters of fact , which we never have observed . Just as we know matters of fact , which we have observed , without the need of any further evidence , and just as we know , for instance , that 2+2=4 , without the need of any proof , it is possible that we may know , directly and immediately , without the need of any basis in experience , some facts which we never have observed . This is certainly possible , in the same sense in which it is possible that I do not really know any external facts: no conclusive disproof can be brought against either position . We must make assumptions as to what facts we do know and do not know , before we can proceed to discuss whether or not all of the former are based on experience; and none of these assumptions can , in the last resort , be conclusively proved . We may offer one of them in proof of another; but it will always be possible to dispute the one which we offer in proof . But there are , in fact , certain kinds of things which we universally assume that we do know or do not know , just as we assume that we do know some external facts; and if among all the things which we know as certainly as this , there should turn out to be none for which we have no basis in experience , Hume's view would I think , be as fully proved as it is capable of being . The question is: Can it be proved in this sense ? Among all the facts beyond our own observation , which we know most certainly , are there any which are certainly not based upon experience ? For my part , I confess , I cannot feel certain what is the right answer to this question: I cannot tell whether Hume was right or wrong . But if he was wrong--if there are any matters of fact , beyond our own observation , which we know for certain , and which yet we know directly and immediately , without any basis in experience , we are , I think , faced with an eminently interesting problem . For it is , I think , as certain as anything can be that there are some kinds of facts with regard to which Hume was right--that there are some kinds of facts which we cannot know without the evidence of experience . I could not know , for instance , without some such evidence , such a fact as that Julius Caesar was murdered . For such a fact I must , in the first instance , have the evidence of other persons; and if I am to know that their evidence is trustworthy , I must have some ground in experience for supposing it to be so . There are , therefore , some kinds of facts which we cannot know without the evidence of experience and observation . And if it is to be maintained that there are others , which we can know without any such evidence , it ought to be pointed out exactly what kind of facts these are , and in what respects they differ from those which we cannot know without the help of experience . Hume gives us a very clear division of the kinds of propositions which we can know to be true . There are , first of all , some propositions which assert "relations of ideas "; there are , secondly , propositions which assert "matters of fact" which we ourselves are actually observing , or have observed and now remember; and there are , thirdly , propositions which assert "matters of fact" which we have never actually observed , but for believing in which we have some foundation in our past observations . And it is , I think , certain that some propositions , which we know as certainly as we know anything , do belong to each of these three classes . I know , for instance , that twice two are four; I know by direct observation that I am now seeing these words , that I am writing , and by memory that this afternoon I saw St . Paul's; and I know also that Julius Caesar was murdered , and I have some foundation in experience for this belief , though I did not myself witness the murder . Do any of those propositions , which we know as certainly as we know these and their like , not belong to either of these three classes ? Must we add a fourth class consisting of propositions which resemble the two last , in respect of the fact that they do assert "matters of fact ," but which differ from them , in that we know them neither by direct observation nor by memory , nor yet as a result of previous observations ? There may , perhaps , be such a fourth class; but , if there is , it is , I think , eminently desirable that it should be pointed out exactly what propositions they are which we do know in this way; and this , so far as I know , has never yet been done , at all clearly , by any philosopher . THE STATUS OF SENSE-DATA The term "sense-data" is ambiguous; and therefore I think I had better begin by trying to explain what the class of entities is whose status I propose to discuss . There are several different classes of mental events , all of which , owing to their intrinsic resemblance to one another in certain respects , may , in a wide sense , be called "sensory experiences ," although only some among them would usually be called "sensations ." There are (1) those events , happening in our minds while we are awake , which consist in the experiencing of one of those entities , which are usually called "images ," in the narrowest sense of the term . Everybody distinguishes these events from sensations proper; and yet everybody admits that "images" intrinsically resemble the entities which are experienced in sensations proper in some very important respect . There are (2) the sensory experiences we have in dreams , some of which would certainly be said to be experiences of images , while others might be said to be sensations . There are (3) hallucinations , and certain classes of illusory sensory experiences . There are (4) those experiences , which used to be called the having of "after-images ," but which psychologists now say ought rather to be called "after-sensations ." And there are , finally , (5) that class of sensory experiences , which are immensely commoner than any of the above , and which may be called sensations proper , if we agree to use this term in such a way as to exclude experiences of my first four sorts . Every event , of any one of these five classes , consists in the fact that an entity , of some kind or other , is experienced . The entity which is experienced may be of many different kinds; it may , for instance , be a patch of colour , or a sound , or a smell , or a taste , etc; or it may be an image of a patch of colour , an image of a sound , an image of a smell , an image of a taste , etc . But , whatever be its nature , the entity which is experienced must in all cases be distinguished from the fact or event which consists in its being experienced; since by saying that it is experienced we mean that it has a relation of a certain kind to something else . We can , therefore , speak not only of experiences of these five kinds , but also of the entities which are experienced in experiences of these kinds; and the entity which is experienced in such an experience is never identical with the experience which consists in its being experienced . But we can speak not only of the entities which are experienced in experiences of this kind , but also of the sort of entities which are experienced in experiences of this kind; and these two classes may again be different . For a patch of colour , even if it were not actually experienced , would be an entity of the same sort as some which are experienced in experiences of this kind: and there is no contradiction in supposing that there are patches of colour , which yet are not experienced; since by calling a thing a patch of colour we merely make a statement about its intrinsic quality , and in no way assert that it has to anything else any of the relations which may be meant by saying that it is experienced . In speaking , therefore , of the sort of entities which are experienced in experiences of the five kinds I have mentioned , we do not necessarily confine ourselves to those which actually are experienced in some such experience: we leave it an open question whether the two classes are identical or not . And the class of entities , whose status I wish to discuss , consists precisely of all those , whether experienced or not , which are of the same sort as those which are experienced in experiences of these five kinds . I intend to call this class of entities the class of sensibles; so that the question I am to discuss can be expressed in the form: What is the status of sensibles ? And it must be remembered that images and after-images are just as much "sensibles ," in my sense of the term , as the entities which are experienced in sensations proper; and so , too , are any patches of colour , or sounds , or smells , etc , (if such there be) , which are not experienced at all . In speaking of sensibles as the sort of entities which are experienced in sensory experiences I seem to imply that all the entities which are experienced in sensory experiences have some common characteristic other than that which consists in their being so experienced . And I cannot help thinking that this is the case , in spite of the fact that it is difficult to see what intrinsic character can be shared in common by entities so different from one another as are patches of colour , sounds , smells , tastes , etc . For , so far as I can see , some non-sensory experiences may be exactly similar to sensory ones in all intrinsic respects , except that what is experienced in them is different in kind from what is experienced in any sensory experience: the relation meant by saying that in them something is experienced may be exactly the same in kind , and so may the experient . And , if this be so , it seems to compel us to admit that the distinction between sensory and non-sensory experiences is derived from that between sensibles , and non-sensibles and not vice versâ . I am inclined , therefore , to think that all sensibles , in spite of the great differences between them , have some common intrinsic property , which we recognise , but which is unanalysable; and that , when we call an experience sensory , what we mean is not only that in it something is experienced in a particular way , but also that this something has this unanalysable property . If this be so , the ultimate definition of "sensibles" would be merely all entities which have this unanalysable property . It seems to me that the term "sense-data" is often used , and may be correctly used , simply as a synonym for "sensibles"; and everybody , I think , would expect me , in discussing the status of sense-data , to discuss , among other things , the question whether there are any sensibles which are not "given ." It is true that the etymology of the term "sense-data" suggests that nothing should be called a sense-datum , but what is given; so that to talk of a non-given sense-datum would be a contradiction in terms . But , of course , etymology is no safe guide either as to the actual or the correct use of terms; and it seems to me that the term "sense-data" is often , and quite properly , used merely for the sort of entities that are given in sense , and not in any way limited to those which are actually given . But though I think I might thus have used "sense-data" quite correctly instead of "sensibles ," I think the latter term is perhaps more convenient; because though nobody ought to be misled by etymologies , so many people in fact are so . Moreover the term "sense-data" is sometimes limited in yet another way , viz , to the sort of sensibles which are experienced in sensations proper; so that in this sense "images" would not be "sense-data ." For both these reasons , I think it is perhaps better to drop the term "sense-data" altogether , and to speak only of "sensibles ." My discussion of the status of sensibles will be divided into two parts . I shall first consider how , in certain respects , they are related to our minds; and then I shall consider how , in certain respects , they are related to physical objects . (I) (1) We can , I think , distinguish pretty clearly at least one kind of relation which sensibles , of all the kinds I have mentioned , do undoubtedly sometimes have to our minds . I do now see certain blackish marks on a whitish ground , and I hear certain sounds which I attribute to the ticking of my clock . In both cases I have to certain sensibles--certain blackish marks , in the one case , and certain sounds , in the other--a kind of relation with which we are all perfectly familiar , and which may be expressed , in the one case , by saying that I actually see the marks , and in the other , by saying that I actually hear the sounds . It seems to me quite evident that the relation to the marks which I express by saying that I see them , is not different in kind from the relation to the sounds which I express by saying that I hear them . "Seeing" and "hearing ," when thus used as names for a relation which we may have to sensibles , are not names for different relations , but merely express the fact that , in the one case , the kind of sensible to which I have a certain kind of relation is a patch of colour , while , in the other case , the kind of sensible to which I have the same kind of relation is a sound . And similarly when I say that I feel warm or smell a smell these different verbs do not express the fact that I have a different kind of relation to the sensibles concerned , but only that I have the same kind of relation to a different kind of sensible . Even when I call up a visual image of a sensible I saw yesterday , or an auditory image of a sound I heard yesterday , I have to those images exactly the same kind of relation which I have to the patches of colour I now see and which I had yesterday to those I saw then . But this kind of relation , which I sometimes have to sensibles of all sorts of different kinds , images as well as others , is evidently quite different in kind from another relation which I may also have to sensibles . After looking at this black mark , I may turn away my head or close my eyes , and then I no longer actually see the mark I saw just now . I may , indeed , have (I myself actually do have at this moment) a visual image of the mark before my mind; and to this image I do now have exactly the same kind of relation which I had just now to the mark itself . But the image is not identical with the mark of which it is an image; and to the mark itself it is quite certain that I have not now got the same kind of relation as I had just now , when I was actually seeing it . And yet I certainly may now have to that mark itself a kind of relation , which may be expressed by saying that I am thinking of it or remembering it . I can now make judgments about it itself--the very sensible which I did see just now and am no longer seeing: as , for instance , that I did then see it and that it was different from the image of it which I am now seeing . It is , therefore , quite certain that there is a most important difference between the relation I have to a sensible when I am actually seeing or hearing it , and any relation (for there may be several) which I may have to the same sensible when I am only thinking or or remembering it . And I want to express this difference by using a particular term for the former relation . I shall express this relation , which I certainly do have to a sensible when I actually see or hear it , and most certainly do not have to it , when I only think of or remember it , by saying that there is in my mind a direct apprehension of it . I have expressly chosen this term because , so far as I know , it has not been used hitherto as a technical term; whereas all the terms which have been so used , such as "presented ," "given ," "perceived ," seem to me to have been spoilt by ambiguity . People sometimes , no doubt , use these terms as names for the kind of relation I am concerned with . But you can never be sure , when an entity is said to be "given" or "presented" or "perceived ," that what is meant is simply and solely that it has to someone that relation which sensibles do undoubtedly have to me when I actually see or hear them , and which they do not have to me when I only think of or remember them . I have used the rather awkward expression "There is in my mind a direct apprehension of this black mark ," because I want to insist that though , when I see the mark , the mark certainly has to something the fundamental relation which I wish to express by saying that it is directly apprehended , and though the event which consists in its being directly apprehended by that something is certainly a mental act of mine or which occurs in my mind , yet the something which directly apprehends it may quite possibly not be anything which deserves to be called "I" or "me ." It is quite possible , I think , that there is no entity whatever which deserves to be called "I" or "me" or "my mind"; and hence that nothing whatever is ever directly apprehended by me . Whether this is so or not , depends on the nature of that relation which certainly does hold between all those mental acts which are mine , and does not hold between any of mine and any of yours; and which holds again between all those mental acts which are yours , but does not hold between any of yours and any of mine . And I do not feel at all sure what the correct analysis of this relation is . It may be the case that the relation which unites all those acts of direct apprehension which are mine , and which is what we mean to say that they have to one another when we say they are all mine , really does consist in the fact that one and the same entity is what directly apprehends in each of them: in which case this entity could properly be called "me ," and it would be true to say that , when I see this black mark , I directly apprehend it . But it is also quite possible (and this seems to me to be the view which is commonest amongst psychologists) that the entity which directly apprehends , in those acts of direct apprehension which are mine , is numerically different in every different act; and that what I mean by calling all these different acts mine is either merely that they have some kind of relation to one another or that they all have a common relation to some other entity , external to them , which may or may not be something which deserves to be called "me ." On any such view , what I assert to be true of this black mark , when I say that it is seen by me , would not be simply that it is directly apprehended by me , but something more complex in which , besides direct apprehension , some other quite different relation was also involved . I should be asserting both (1) that the black mark is being directly apprehended by something , and (2) that this act of direct apprehension has to something else , external to it , a quite different relation , which is what makes it an act of mine . I do not know how to decide between these views , and that is why I wished to explain that the fundamental relation which I wish to call direct apprehension , is one which quite possibly never holds between me and any sensible . But , once this has been explained , I think no harm can result from using the expression "I directly apprehend A" as a synonym for "A direct apprehension of A occurs in my mind ." And in future I shall so speak , because it is much more convenient . The only other point , which seems to me to need explanation , in order to make it quite clear what the relation I call "direct apprehension" is , concerns its relation to attention; and as to this I must confess I don't feel clear . In every case where it is quite clear to me that I am directly apprehending a given entity , it seems also clear to me that I am , more or less , attending to it; and it seems to me possible that what I mean by "direct apprehension" may be simply identical with what is meant by "attention ," in one of the senses in which that word can be used . That it can , at most , only be identical with one of the relations meant by attention seems to me clear , because I certainly can be said to attend , in some sense or other , to entities , which I am not directly apprehending: I may , for instance , think , with attention , of a sensible , which I saw yesterday , and am certainly not seeing now . It is , therefore , clear that to say I am attending to a thing and yet am not directly apprehending it , is not a contradiction in terms: and this fact alone is sufficient to justify the use of the special term "direct apprehension ." But whether to say that I am directly apprehending a given thing and yet am not attending to it , in any degree at all , is or is not a contradiction in terms , I admit I don't feel clear . However that may be , one relation , in which sensibles of all sorts do sometimes stand to our minds , is the relation constituted by the fact that we directly apprehend them: or , to speak more accurately , by the fact that events which consist in their being directly apprehended are in our minds , in the sense in which to say that an event is in our minds means merely that it is a mental act of ours--that it has to our other mental acts that relation (whatever it may be) which we mean by saying that they are all mental acts of the same individual . And it is clear that to say of a sensible that it is directly apprehended by me , is to say of it something quite different from what I say of a mental act of mine , when I say that this mental act is in my mind: for nothing is more certain than that an act of direct apprehension or belief may be in my mind , without being itself directly apprehended by me . If , therefore , by saying that a sensible is in our minds or is ours , we mean merely that it is directly apprehended by us , we must recognise that we are here using the phrases "in our minds" or "ours" in quite a different sense from that in which we use them when we talk of our mental acts being "in our minds" or "ours ." And why I say this is because I think that these two relations are very apt to be confused . When , for instance , we say of a given entity that it is "experienced ," or when the Germans say that it is "erlebt ," it is sometimes meant , I think , merely that it is directly apprehended , but sometimes that it is in my mind , in the sense in which , when I entertain a belief , this act of belief is in my mind . But (2) it seems to me to be commonly held that sensibles are often in our minds in some sense quite other than that of being directly apprehended by us or that of being thought of by us . This seems to me to be often what is meant when people say that they are "immediately experienced" or are "subjective modifications"; though , of course , both expressions are so ambiguous , that when people say that a given entity is immediately experienced or is a subjective modification , they may mean merely that it is directly apprehended . And since I think this view is held , I want to explain that I see no reason whatever for thinking that sensibles ever are experienced by us in any other sense than that of being directly apprehended by us . Two kinds of argument , I think , are sometimes used to show that they are . (a) It is a familiar fact that , when , for instance , we are in a room with a ticking clock , we may seem suddenly to become aware of the ticks , whereas , so far as we can tell , we had previously not heard them at all . And it may be urged that in these cases , since the same kind of stimulus was acting on our ears all the time , we must have experienced the same kind of sensible sounds , although we did not directly apprehend them . But I think most psychologists are now agreed that this argument is quite worthless . There seem to me to be two possible alternatives to the conclusion drawn . It may , I think , possibly be the case that we did directly apprehend the ticks all the time , but that we cannot afterwards remember that we did , because the degree of attention (if any) with which we heard them was so small , that in ordinary life we should say that we did not attend to them at all . But , what , I think , is much more likely is that , though the same stimulus was acting on our ears , it failed to produce any mental effect whatever , because our attention was otherwise engaged . (b) It is said that sometimes when we suddenly become aware , say , of the eighth stroke of a striking clock , we can remember earlier strokes , although we seem to ourselves not to have directly apprehended them . I cannot say that I have ever noticed this experience in myself , but I have no doubt that it is possible . And people seem inclined to argue that , since we can remember the earlier strokes , we must have experienced them , though we did not directly apprehend them . But here again , the argument does not seem to me at all conclusive . I should say , again , that it is possible that we did directly apprehend them , but only with a very slight degree of attention (if any) . And , as an alternative , I should urge that there is no reason why we should not be able to remember a thing , which we never experienced at all . I do not know what other arguments can be used to show that we sometimes experience sensibles in a sense quite other than that of directly apprehending them . But I do not know how to show that we do not; and since people whose judgment I respect , seem to hold that we do , I think it is worth while to say something as to what this sense of "experience" can be , in case it does occur . I have said that sometimes when people say that a given entity is "experienced" they seem to mean that it belongs to some individual , in the sense in which my acts of belief belong to me . To say that sensibles were experienced by me in this sense would , therefore , be to say that they sometimes have to my acts of belief and acts of direct apprehension the same relation which these have to one another--the relation which constitutes them mine . But that sensibles ever have this kind of relation to my mental acts , is a thing which I cannot believe . Those who hold that they are ever experienced at all , in some sense other than that of being directly apprehended , always hold , I think , that , whenever they are directly apprehended by us , they also , at the same time , have to us this other relation as well . And it seems to me pretty clear that when I do directly apprehend a sensible , it does not have to me the same relation which my direct apprehension of it has . If , therefore , sensibles are ever experienced by us at all , in any sense other than that of being directly apprehended by us , we must , I think , hold that they are so in an entirely new sense , quite different both from that in which to be experienced means to be directly apprehended , and from that in which to be experienced means to occur in some individual's mind . And I can only say that I see no reason to think that they ever are experienced in any such sense . If they are , the fact that they are so is presumably open to the inspection of us all; but I cannot distinguish any such fact as occurring in myself , as I can distinguish the fact that they are directly apprehended . On the other hand , I see no way of showing that they are not experienced in some such sense; and perhaps somebody will be able to point it out to me . I do not wish to assume , therefore , that there is no such sense; and hence , though I am inclined to think that the only sense in which they are experienced is that of being directly apprehended , I shall , in what follows , use the phrase "experienced" to mean either directly apprehended or having to something this supposed different relation , if such a relation there be . (3) We may now , therefore , raise the question: Do sensibles ever exist at times when they are not being experienced at all ? To this question it is usual to give a negative answer , and two different a priori reasons may be urged in favour of that answer . The first is what should be meant by Berkeley's dictum that the esse of sensibles is percipi . This should mean , whatever else it may mean , at least this: that to suppose a sensible to exist and yet not to be experienced in self-contradictory . And this at least seems to me to be clearly false . Anything which was a patch of colour would be a sensible; and to suppose that there are patches of colour which are not being experienced is clearly not self-contradictory , however false it may be . It may , however , be urged (and this is the second argument) that , though to suppose a thing to be a sensible and yet not experienced is not self-contradictory , yet we can clearly see that nothing can have the one property without having the other . And I do not see my way to deny that we may be able to know , a priori that such a connection holds between two such properties . In the present case , however , I cannot see that it does hold , and therefore , so far as a priori reasons go , I conclude that there is no reason why sensibles should not exist at times when they are not experienced . It may , however , be asked: Is there any reason to suppose that they ever do ? And the reason , which weighs with me most , is one which applies , I think , to a certain class of sensibles only; a class which I will try to define by saying that it consists of those which would (under certain conditions which actually exist) be experienced in a sensation proper , if only a living body , having a certain constitution , existed under those conditions in a position in which no such body does actually exist . I think it is very probable that this definition does not define at all accurately the kind of sensibles I mean; but I think that what the definition aims at will become clearer when I proceed to give my reasons for supposing that sensibles , of a kind to be defined in some such way , do exist unexperienced . The reason is simply that , in Hume's phrase , I have "a strong propensity to believe" that , e .g . , the visual sensibles which I directly apprehend in looking at this paper , still exist unchanged when I merely alter the position of my body by turning away my head or closing my eyes , provided that the physical conditions outside my body remain unchanged . In such a case it is certainly true in some sense that I should see sensibles like what I saw the moment before , if only my head were still in the position it was at that moment or my eyes unclosed . But if , in such a case , there is reason to think that sensibles which I should see , if the position of my body were altered , exist in spite of the fact that I do not experience them , there is , I think , an equal reason to suppose it in other cases . We must , for instance , suppose that the sensibles which I should see now , if I were at the other end of the room , or if I were looking under the table , exist at this moment , though they are not being experienced . And similarly we must suppose that the sensibles which you would see , if you were in the position in which I am now , exist at this moment , in spite of the fact that they may be more or less different from those which I see , owing to the different constitution of our bodies . All this implies of course , that a vast number of sensibles exist at any moment , which are not being experienced at all . But still it implies this only with regard to sensibles of a strictly limited class , namely sensibles which would be experienced in a sensation proper , if a body , having a certain constitution , were in a position in which it is not , under the given physical conditions . It does not , for instance , imply that any images , of which it may be true that I should have them , under present physical conditions , if the position of my body were altered , exist now; nor does it imply that sensibles which would be experienced by me now in a sensation proper , if the physical conditions external to my body were different from what they are , exist now . I feel , of course , that I have only succeeded in defining miserably vaguely the kind of sensibles I mean; and I do not know whether the fact that I have a strong propensity to believe that sensibles of a kind to be defined in some such way , do exist unexperienced , is any good reason for supposing that they actually do . The belief may , of course , be a mere prejudice . But I do not know of any certain test by which prejudices can be distinguished from reasonable beliefs . And I cannot help thinking that there may be a class of sensibles , capable of definition in some such way , which there really is reason to think exist unexperienced . But , if I am not mistaken , there is an empirical argument which , though , even if it were sound , it would have no tendency whatever to show that no sensibles exist unexperienced , would , if it were sound , show that this very class of sensibles , to which alone my argument for unexperienced existence applies , certainly do not so exist . This , it seems to me , is the most weighty argument which can be used upon the subject; and I want , therefore , to give my reasons for thinking that it is fallacious . The argument is one which asserts that there is abundant empirical evidence in favour of the view that the existence of the sensibles which we experience at any time , always depends upon the condition of our nervous system: so that , even where it also depends upon external physical conditions , we can safely say that sensibles , which we should have experienced , if only our nervous system had been in a different condition , certainly do not exist , when it is not in that condition . And the fallacy of this argument seems to me to lie in the fact that it does not distinguish between the existence of the sensibles which we experience and the fact that we experience them . What there is evidence for is that our experience of sensibles always depends upon the condition of our nervous system; that , according as the condition of the nervous system changes , different sensibles are experienced , even where other conditions are the same . But obviously the fact that our experience of a given sensible depends upon the condition of our nervous system does not directly show that the existence of the sensible experienced always also so depends . The fact that I am now experiencing this black mark is certainly a different fact from the fact that this black mark now exists . And hence the evidence which does tend to show that the former fact would not have existed if my nervous system had been in a different condition , has no tendency to show that the latter would not have done so either . I am sure that this distinction ought to be made; and hence , though I think there may be other reasons for thinking that the very existence of the sensibles , which we experience , and not merely the fact that we experience them does always depend upon the condition of our nervous systems , it seems to me certain that this particular argument constitutes no such reason . And I think that those who suppose that it does are apt to be influenced by an assumption , for which also , so far as I can see , there is no reason . I have admitted that the only reason I can see for supposing that sensibles which we experience ever exist unexperienced , seems to lead to the conclusion that the sensibles which would be seen by a colour-blind man , if he occupied exactly the position which I , who am not colour-blind , now occupy , exist now , just as much as those which I now see . And it may be thought that this implies that the sensibles , which he would see , and which would certainly be very different from those which I see , are nevertheless at this moment in exactly the same place as those which I see . Now , for my part , I am not prepared to admit that it is impossible they should be in the same place . But the assumption against which I wish to protest , is the assumption that , if they exist at all , they must be in the same place . I can see no reason whatever for this assumption . And hence any difficulties there may be in the way of supposing that they could be in the same place at the same time as the sensibles which I see , do not at all apply to my hypothesis , which is only that they exist now , not that they exist in the same place in which mine do . On this question , therefore , as to whether sensibles ever exist at times when they are not experienced , I have only to say (1) that I think there is certainly no good reason whatever for asserting that no sensibles do; and (2) that I think perhaps a certain amount of weight ought to be attached to our instinctive belief that certain kinds of sensibles do; and that here again any special arguments which may be brought forward to show that , whether some sensibles exist unexperienced or not , this kind certainly do not , are , so far as I can see , wholly inconclusive . (II) I now pass to the question how sensibles are related to physical objects . And here I want to say , to begin with , that I feel extremely puzzled about the whole subject . I find it extremely difficult to distinguish clearly from one another the different considerations which ought to be distinguished; and all I can do is to raise , more or less vaguely , certain questions as to how certain particular sensibles are related to certain particular physical objects , and to give the reasons which seem to me to have most weight for answering these questions in one way rather than another . I feel that all that I can say is very tentative . To begin with , I do not know how "physical object" is to be defined , and I shall not try to define it . I shall , instead , consider certain propositions , which everybody will admit to be propositions about physical objects , and which I shall assume that I know to be true . And the question I shall raise is as to how these propositions are to be interpreted--in what sense they are true; in considering which , we shall at the same time consider how they are related to certain sensibles . I am looking at two coins , one of which is a half-crown , the other a florin . Both are lying on the ground; and they are situated obliquely to my line of sight , so that the visual sensibles which I directly apprehend in looking at them are visibly elliptical , and not even approximately circular . Moreover , the half-crown is so much farther from me than the florin that its visual sensible is visibly smaller than that of the florin . In these circumstances I am going to assume that I know the following propositions to be true; and no one , I think , will deny that we can know such propositions to be true , though , as we shall see , extremely different views may be taken as to what they mean . I know (a) that , in the ordinary sense of the word "see" I am really seeing two coins; an assertion which includes , if it is not identical with , the assertion that the visual experiences , which consist in my direct apprehension of those two elliptical patches of colour , are sensations proper , and are not either hallucinations nor mere experiences of "images"; (b) that the upper sides of the coins are really approximately circular , and not merely elliptical like the visual sensibles; (c) that the coins have another side , and an inside , though I don't see it; (d) that the upper side of the half-crown is really larger than that of the florin , though its visual sensible is smaller than the visual sensible of the upper side of the florin: (e) that both coins continue to exist , even when I turn away my head or shut my eyes; but in saying this , I do not , of course , mean to say that there is absolutely no change in them; I daresay there must be some change , and I do not know how to define exactly what I do mean . But we can , I think , say at least this: viz . , that propositions (h) , (c) , and (d) will still be true , although proposition (a) has ceased to be true . Now all these propositions are , I think , typical propositions of the sort which we call propositions about physical objects; and the two coins themselves are physical objects , if anything is . My question is: In what sense are these propositions true ? And in considering this question , there are , I think , two principles which we can lay down as certain to begin with; though they do not carry us very far . The one is (a) that the upper side of the coin , which I am said to see , is not simply identical with the visual sensible which I directly apprehend in seeing it . That this is so might be thought to follow absolutely from each of the two facts which I have called (b) and (d); but I am not quite sure that it does follow from either of these or from both together: for it seems to me just possible that the two sensibles in question , though not circular in my private space , may yet be circular in physical space; and similarly that though the sensible of the half-crown is smaller than that of the florin in my private space , it may be larger in physical space . But what I think it does follow from is the fact that another person may be seeing the upper side of the coin in exactly the same sense in which I am seeing it , and yet his sensible be certainly different from mine . From this it follows absolutely that the upper side of the coin cannot be identical with both sensibles , since they are not identical with one another . And though it does not follow absolutely that it may not be identical with one of the two , yet it does follow that we can get a case in which it is not identical with mine and I need only assume that the case I am taking is such a case . From this it follows that we must distinguish that sense of the word "see" in which we can be said to "see" a physical object , from that sense of the word in which "see" means merely to directly apprehend a visual sensible . In a proposition of the form "I see A ," where A is a name or description of some physical object , though , if this proposition is to be true , there must be some visual sensible , B , which I am directly apprehending , yet the proposition "I see A" is certainly not always , and probably never , identical in meaning with the proposition "I directly apprehend B ." In asserting "I see A" we are asserting not only that we directly apprehend some sensible but also something else about this sensible--it may be only some proposition of the form , "and this sensible has certain other properties ," or it may be some proposition of the form "and I know this sensible to have certain other properties ." Indeed we have not only to distinguish that sense of the word "perceive" in which it is equivalent to "directly apprehend ," from one sense in which we can be said to perceive a physical object; we have also to distinguish at least two different senses in which we can be said to perceive physical objects , different both from one another and from "directly apprehend ." For it is obvious that though I should be said to be now seeing the half-crown , there is a narrower , and more proper , sense , in which I can only be said to see one side of it--not its lower side or its inside , and not therefore the whole half-crown . The other principle , which we can lay down to start with is (β) that my knowledge of all the five propositions (a) to (e) , is based , in the last resort , on experiences of mine consisting in the direct apprehension of sensibles and in the perception of relations between directly apprehended sensibles . It is based on these , in at least this sense , that I should never have known any of these propositions if I had never directly apprehended any sensibles nor perceived any relations between them . What , in view of these two principles , can be the sense in which my five propositions are true ? (1) It seems to me possible that the only true interpretation which can be given to any of them is an interpretation of a kind which I can only indicate rather vaguely as follows: Namely , that all of them express only a kind of fact which we should naturally express by saying that , if certain conditions were fulfilled , I or some other person , should directly apprehend certain other sensibles . For instance the only true thing that can be meant by saying that I really see coins may be some such thing as that , if I were to move my body in certain ways , I should directly apprehend other sensibles , e .g . tactual ones , which I should not directly apprehend as a consequence of these movements , if these present visual experiences of mine were mere hallucinations or experiences of "images ." Again , the only true thing that can be meant by saying that the upper sides of the coins are really approximately circular may be some such thing as that , if I were looking straight at them , I should directly apprehend circular sensibles . And similarly , the only true interpretation of (c) may be some such fact as that , if I were to turn the coins over , or break them up , I should have certain sensations , of a sort I can imagine very well; of (d) that if I were at an equal distance from the half-crown and the florin , the sensible , I should then see corresponding to the half-crown would be bigger than that corresponding to the florin , whereas it is now smaller; of (e) that , if , when my eyes were closed , they had been open instead , I should have seen certain sensibles . It is obvious , indeed , that if any interpretation on these lines is the only true interpretation of our five propositions , none of those which I have vaguely suggested comes anywhere near to expressing it in its ultimate form . They cannot do so for the simple reason that , in them , the conditions under which I should experience certain other sensibles are themselves expressed in terms of physical objects , and not in terms of sensibles and our experience of them . The conditions are expressed in such terms as "if I were to move my body ," "if I were to look straight at the coins ," "if I were to turn the coins over ," etc .; and all these are obviously propositions , which must themselves again be interpreted in terms of sensibles , if our original five propositions need to be so . It is obvious , therefore , that any ultimate interpretation of our five propositions , on these lines , would be immensely complicated; and I cannot come anywhere near to stating exactly what it would be . But it seems to me possible that some such interpretation could be found , and that it is the only true one . The great recommendation of this view seems to me to be that it enables us to see , more clearly than any other view can , how our knowledge of physical propositions can be based on our experience of sensibles , in the way in which principle (β) asserts it to be . If , when I know that the coins are round , all that I know is some such thing as that if , after experiencing the sensibles I do now experience , I were to experience still others , I should finally experience a third set , we can understand , as clearly as we can understand how any knowledge can be obtained by induction at all , how such a knowledge could be based on our previous experience of sensibles , and how it could be verified by our subsequent experience . On the other hand , apart from the difficulty of actually giving any interpretation on these lines , which will meet the requirements , the great objection to it seems to me to be this . It is obvious that , on this view , though we shall still be allowed to say that the coins existed before I saw them , are circular etc . , all these expressions , if they are to be true , will have to be understood in a Pickwickian sense . When I know that the coins existed before I saw them , what I know will not be that anything whatever existed at that time , in the sense in which those elliptical patches of colour exist now . All that I know will be simply that , since the elliptical patches exist now , it is true , that , if certain unrealised conditions had been realised , I should have had certain sensations that I have not had; or , if certain conditions , which may or may not be realised in the future , were to be so , I should have certain experiences . Something like this will actually be the only true thing that can be meant by saying that the coins existed before I saw them . In other words , to say of a physical object that it existed at a given time will always consist merely in saying of some sensible , not that it existed at the time in question , but something quite different and immensely complicated . And thus , though , when I know that the coins exist , what I know will be merely some proposition about these sensibles which I am directly apprehending , yet this view will not contradict principle (a) by identifying the coins with the sensibles . For it will say that to assert a given thing of the coins is not equivalent to asserting the same thing of the sensibles , but only to asserting of them something quite different . The fact that these assertions that the coins exist , are round , etc . , will , on this view , only be true in this outrageously Pickwickian sense , seems to me to constitute the great objection to it . But it seems to me to be an objection only , so far as I can see , because I have a "strong propensity to believe" that , when I know that the coins existed before I saw them , what I know is that something existed at that time , in the very same sense in which those elliptical patches now exist . And , of course , this belief may be a mere prejudice . It may be that when I believe that I now have , in my body , blood and nerves and brain , what I believe is only true , if it does not assert , in the proper sense of the word "existence ," the present existence of anything whatever , other than sensibles which I directly apprehend , but only makes assertions as to the kind of experiences a doctor would have , if he dissected me . But I cannot feel at all sure that my belief , that , when I know of the present Existence of these things (as I think I do) , I am knowing of the present existence (in the proper sense) of things other than any sensibles which I or any one else am now directly apprehending , is a mere prejudice . And therefore I think it is worth while to consider what , if it is not , these things , of whose existence I know , can be . (2) It is certain that if , when I know that that half-crown existed before I saw it , I am knowing that something existed at that time in other than a Pickwickian sense , I only know this something by description; and it seems pretty clear that the description by which I know it is as the thing which has a certain connection with this sensible which I am now directly apprehending . But what connection ? We cannot simply say , as many people have said , that by "that half-crown" I mean the thing which caused my experience of this sensible; because events which happen between the half-crown and my eyes , and events in my eyes , and optic nerves , and brains are just as much causes of my experiences as the half-crown itself . But it may perhaps be the case that the half-crown has some particular kind of causal relation to my experience , which these other events have not got--a kind which may be expressed , perhaps , by saying that it is its "source ." And hence , when I know that that half-crown is circular , I may perhaps be knowing that the source of this experience is circular . But what sort of a thing can this "source" be ? One kind of view , which I think is very commonly held , is that it is something "spiritual" in its nature , or something whose nature is utterly unknown to us . And those who hold this view are apt to add , that it is not really "circular ," in any sense at all; nor is the "source" of my half-crown experience , in any sense at all , "bigger" than that of my florin experience . But if this addition were seriously meant , it would , of course , amount to saying that propositions (b) and (d) are not true , in any sense at all; and I do not think that those who make it , really mean to say this . I think that what they mean is only that the only sense in which those "sources" are circular , and one bigger than the other , is one in which to say this merely amounts to saying that the sensibles , which they would cause us to experience , under certain conditions , would be circular , and one bigger than the other . In other words , in order to give a true interpretation to the propositions that the coins are circular and one bigger than the other , they say that we must interpret them in the same kind of way in which view (1) interpreted them; and the only difference between their view and view (1) , is that , whereas that said that you must give a Pickwickian interpretation both to the assertion that the coins exist , and to the assertion that they are circular , they say that you must not give it to the former assertion , and must to the latter . To this view my objection is only that any reason there may be for saying that the "sources" exist in other than a Pickwickian sense , seems to me to be also a reason for saying that they are "circular" in a sense that is not Pickwickian . I have just as strong a propensity to believe that they are really circular , in a simple and natural sense , as that they exist in such a sense: and I know of no better reason for believing either . (3) It may be suggested , next , that these "sources ," instead of being something spiritual in their nature or something of a nature utterly unknown , consist simply of sensibles , of a kind which I have previously tried to define; namely of all those sensibles , which anybody would , under the actual physical conditions , experience in sensations proper of which the half-crown and the florin were the source , if their bodies were in any of the positions relatively to those coins , in which they would get sensations from them at all . We saw before that it seems possible that all these sensibles do really exist at times when they are not experienced , and that some people , at all events , seem to have a strong propensity to believe that they do . And in favour of the view that some such huge collection of sensibles is the upper side of the half-crown , is the fact that we do seem to have a strong propensity to believe that any particular sensible , which we directly apprehend in looking at the upper side of the half-crown , and of our direct apprehension of which the upper side is the source , is in the place in which the upper side is . And that some sense might be given to the expression "in the same place as ," in which it could be true that sensibles of all sorts of different shapes and sizes , and of all sorts of different colours , were in the same place at the same time , seems to me to be possible . But the objection to this view seems to me to be the same as to the last; namely that if the upper side of the half-crown were identical with such a collection of sensibles , then the only sense in which it could be said to be "circular ," or bigger than that of the florin , would certainly be very Pickwickian , though not the same as on that view . (4) If , for the reasons given , we reject both (1) , (2) , and (3) as interpretations of our five propositions , the only alternative I can think of that remains , is one which is roughly identical , so far as I can see , with Locke's view . It is a view which asserts that the half-crown and the florin really did exist (in the natural sense) before I saw them; that they really are approximately circular (again in the natural sense); that , therefore , they are not composed of sensibles which I or others should directly apprehend under other conditions; and that therefore also neither these sensibles (even if such do now exist) nor those which I am now directly apprehending are in the place in which the coins are . It holds , therefore , that the coins do really resemble some sensibles , in respect of the "primary" qualities which these have; that they really are round , and one larger than the other , in much the same sense in which some sensibles are round and some larger than others . But it holds also that no sensibles which we ever do directly apprehend , or should directly apprehend , if at a given time we were in other positions , are parts of those coins; and that , therefore , there is no reason to suppose that any parts of the coins have any of the "secondary qualities"--colour , etc .--which any of these sensibles have . On this view , it is plain , there is nothing to prevent us from holding that , as suggested in I (3) , all sorts of unexperienced sensibles do exist . We are only prevented from holding that , if they do , those which have the same source all exist in the same place as their source . And the natural view to take as to the status of sensibles generally , relatively to physical objects , would be that none of them , whether experienced or not , were ever in the same place as any physical object . That none , therefore , exist "anywhere" in physical space; while , at the same time , we can also say , as argued in I (2) , that none exist "in the mind ," except in the sense that some are directly apprehended by some minds . And the only thing that would need to be added , is that some , and some only , resemble the physical objects which are their source , in respect of their shape . To this view I can see no objection except the serious one that it is difficult to answer the questions: How can I ever come to know that these sensibles have a "source" at all ? And how do I know that these "sources" are circular ? It would seem that , if I do know these things at all , I must know immediately , in the case of some sensibles , both that they have a source and what the shape of this source is . And to this it may be objected that this is a kind of thing which I certainly cannot know immediately . The argument in favour of an interpretation of type (i) seems to me to rest wholly on the assumption that there are only certain kinds of facts which I can know immediately; and hence that if I believe I know a fact , which is not of this kind , and which also I cannot have learnt immediately , my belief must be a mere prejudice . But I do not know how it can be shown that an assertion of the form: Facts of certain kinds are the only ones you can know immediately; is itself not a prejudice . I do not think , therefore , that the fact that , if this last view were true , we should have to admit that we know immediately facts of a kind which many people think we cannot know immediately , is a conclusive objection to it . THE CONCEPTION OF REALITY The fourth chapter of Mr . Bradley's Appearance and Reality is a chapter headed "Space and Time ," and he begins the chapter as follows:-- "The object of this chapter is far from being an attempt to discuss fully the nature of space or of time . It will content itself with stating our main justification for regarding them as appearances . It will explain why we deny that , in the character which they exhibit , they either have or belong to reality ."[1] Here , it will be seen , Mr . Bradley states that , in his opinion , Time , in a certain character , neither has nor belongs to reality; this is the conclusion he wishes to maintain . And to say that Time has not reality would seem to be plainly equivalent to saying that Time is not real . However , if anybody should doubt whether the two phrases are meant to be equivalent , the doubt may be easily set at rest by a reference to the concluding words of the same chapter , where Mr . Bradley uses the following very emphatic expression: "Time ," he says , "like space , has most evidently proved not to be real , but to be a contradictory appearance" (p . 43) . Mr . Bradley does , then , say here , in so many words , that Time is not real . But there is one other difference between this statement at the end of the chapter , and the statement at the beginning of it , which we must not forget to notice . In the statement at the beginning he carefully qualifies the assertion "Time neither has nor belongs to reality" by saying "Time , in the character which it exhibits , neither has nor belongs to reality ," whereas in the final statement this qualification is not inserted; here he says simply "Time is not real ." This qualification , which is inserted in the one place and omitted in the other , might , of course , be meant to imply that , in some other character--some character which it does not exhibit--Time has reality and does belong to it . And I shall presently have something to say about this distinction between Time in one character and Time in another , because it might be thought that this distinction is the explanation of the difficulty as to Mr . Bradley's meaning , which I am going to point out . However , so far it is clear that Mr . Bradley holds that in some sense , at all events , the whole proposition "Time is not real" can be truly asserted . And , now , I want to quote a passage in which he says things which , at first sight , seem difficult to reconcile with this view . This new passage is a passage in which he is not talking of Time in particular , but of "appearances" in general . But , as we have seen , he does regard Time as one among appearances , and I think there is no doubt that what he here declares to be true of all appearances is meant to be true of Time , among the rest . This new passage is as follows:-- "For the present ," he says ,[2] "we may keep a fast hold upon this , that appearances exist . That is absolutely certain , and to deny it is nonsense . And whatever exists must belong to reality . This is also quite certain , and its denial once more is self-contradictory . Our appearances , no doubt , may be a beggarly show , and their nature to an unknown extent may be something which , as it is , is not true of reality . That is one thing , and it is quite another thing to speak as if these facts had no actual existence , or as if there could be anything but reality to which they might belong . And I must venture to repeat that such an idea would be sheer nonsense . What appears , for that sole reason , most indubitably is; and there is no possibility of conjuring its being away from it ." That is the passage which seems to me to raise a difficulty as to his meaning when contrasted with the former passage . And the reason why it seems to me to raise one is this . In the former passage Mr . Bradley declared most emphatically that Time is not real; he said: "Time has most evidently proved not to be real ." Whereas in this one he seems to declare equally emphatically that Time does exist , and is . And his language here again is as strong as possible . He says it is sheer nonsense to suppose that Time does not exist , is not a fact , does not belong to reality . It looks , therefore , as if he meant to make a distinction between "being real" on the one hand , and "existing ," "being a fact ," and "being" on the other hand--as if he meant to say that a thing may exist , and be , and be a fact , and yet not be real . And I think there is , at all events , some superficial difficulty in understanding this distinction . We might naturally think that to say "Time exists , is a fact , and is ," is equivalent to saying that it is real . What more , we might ask , can a man who says that Time is real mean to maintain about it than that it exists , is a fact , and is ? All that most people would mean by saying that time is real could , it would seem , be expressed by saying "There is such a thing as Time ." And it might , therefore , appear from this new passage as if Mr . Bradley fully agreed with the view that most people would express by saying "Time is real"--as if he did not at all mean to contradict anything that most people believe about Time . But , if so , then what are we to make of his former assertion that , nevertheless , Time is not real ? He evidently thinks that , in asserting this , he is asserting something which is not mere nonsense; and he certainly would not have chosen this way of expressing what he means , unless he had supposed that what he is here asserting about Time is incompatible with what people often mean when they say "Time is real ." Yet , we have seen that he thinks that what he is asserting is not incompatible with the assertions that Time is , and is a fact , and exists . He must , therefore , think that when people say "Time is real" they often , at least , mean something more than merely that there is such a thing as Time , something therefore , which may be denied , without denying this . All the same , there is , I think , a real difficulty in seeing that they ever do mean anything more , and , if they do , what more it is that they can mean . The two expressions "There is such a thing as so and so" and "So and so is real" are certainly sometimes and quite naturally used as equivalents , even if they are not always so used . And Mr . Bradley's own language implies that this is so . For , as we have seen , in the first passage , he seems to identify belonging to reality with being real . The conclusion which he expresses in one place by saying that Time does not belong to reality he expresses in another by saying that it is not real; whereas in the second passage he seems to identify the meaning of the same phrase "belonging to reality" with existing; he says that whatever exists must belong to reality , and that it is self-contradictory to deny this . But if both being real and existing are identical with belonging to reality , it would seem they must be identical with one another . And , indeed , in another passage in the Appendix to the 2nd Edition (p . 555) we find Mr . Bradley actually using the following words: "Anything ," he says , "that in any sense is , qualifies the absolute reality and so is real ." Moreover , as we have seen , he declares it to be nonsense to deny that Time is; he must , therefore , allow that , in a sense , at all events , it is nonsense to deny that Time is real . And yet this denial is the very one he has made . Mr . Bradley , therefore , does seem himself to allow that the word "real" may , sometimes at all events , be properly used as equivalent to the words "exists ," "is a fact ," "is ." And yet his two assertions cannot both be true , unless there is some sense in which the whole proposition "Time is real" is not equivalent to and cannot be inferred from "Time is ," or "Time exists ," or "Time is a fact ." It seems , then , pretty clear that Mr . Bradley must be holding that the statement "Time is real" is in one sense , not equivalent to "Time exists"; though he admits that , in another sense , it is . And I will only quote one other passage which seems to make this plain . "If ," he says later on (p . 206) "Time is not unreal , I admit that our Absolute is a delusion; but , on the other side , it will be urged that time cannot be mere appearance . The change in the finite subject , we are told , is a matter of direct experience; it is a fact , and hence it cannot be explained away . And so much of course is indubitable . Change is a fact and , further , this fact , as such , is not reconcilable with the Absolute . And , if we could not in any way perceive how the fact can be unreal , we should be placed , I admit , in a hopeless dilemma . . . . But our real position is very different from this . For time has been shown to contradict itself , and so to be appearance . With this , its discord , we see at once , may pass as an element into a wider harmony . And with this , the appeal to fact at once becomes worthless ." "It is mere superstition to suppose that an appeal to experience can prove reality . That I find something in existence in the world or in my self , shows that this something exists , and it cannot show more . Any deliverance of consciousness--whether original or acquired--is but a deliverance of consciousness . It is in no case an oracle and a revelation which we have to accept as it is a fact , like other facts , to be dealt with; and there is no presumption anywhere that any fact is better than appearance ." Here Mr . Bradley seems plainly to imply that to be "real" is something more and other than to be a fact or to exist . This is the distinction which I think he means to make , and which , I think , is the real explanation of his puzzling language , and this is the distinction which I am going presently to discuss . But I want first to say something as to that other distinction , which I said might be supposed to be the explanation of the whole difficulty--the distinction implied by the qualification "Time , in the character which it exhibits"; the suggestion that , when we talk of "Time ," we may sometimes mean Time in one character , sometimes in another , and that what is true of it in the one character may not be true of it in the other . It might , I think , be suggested that this is the explanation of the whole difficulty . And I want briefly to point out why I think it cannot be the only explanation . Stated very badly and crudely , the difficulty which requires explanation is this: Mr . Bradley says , "It is sheer nonsense to say Time is not real ." But this thing which he says it is sheer nonsense to say is the very thing which he himself had formerly said . He had said , "Time has most evidently proved not to be real ." Now , Mr . Bradley certainly does not mean to say that this proposition of his own is sheer nonsense; and yet he says , in words , that it is sheer nonsense . This is the difficulty . What is the explanation ? Quite obviously , the explanation can only take one possible form . Mr . Bradley must be holding that the words "Time is real" may have two different senses . In one sense , the denial of them is sheer nonsense; in the other sense , so far from being sheer nonsense , denial of them is , according to him , evidently true . Now , what are these two different senses , between which the difference is so enormous ? It is here that the two different explanations come in . The first and , as I think , the wrong explanation (though I think Mr . Bradley's words do give some colour to it) is this . It might be said: "The whole business is perfectly easy to explain . When Mr . Bradley says that Time is not real , what he means is that Time , in the character which it exhibits , is not real . Whereas , when he says , Time does exist , is a fact , and is , and that it is nonsense to deny this , what he means is that Time does exist , in some other character--some character other than that which it exhibits . He does not mean to make any distinction , such as you suppose , between two meanings of the word I real '--the one of them merely equivalent to 'exists ,' 'is ,' 'is a fact ,' and the other meaning something very different from this . The only distinction he means to make is a distinction between two meanings of 'Time' or of the whole sentence 'Time is real .' He distinguishes between the meaning of this sentence , when it means , 'Time in the character which it exhibits , is real ,' which meaning , he says , is evidently false; and its meaning when it means , 'Time in some other character , is real ,' and this meaning , he says , is evidently true . This is the complete explanation of your supposed puzzle , which is , in fact , therefore , very easy to solve ." This , I think , might be offered as an explanation of Mr . Bradley's meaning . And it must be admitted that it would furnish a complete explanation of the particular puzzle I have just stated , it would completely absolve Mr . Bradley from the charge of inconsistency; and would show that where he appears to contradict himself about the reality of Time , the contradiction is verbal only and not real . We might , indeed , object to this distinction between Time in one character and Time in another; on the ground that anything which has not got the character which Time exhibits , but only some other character , ought not to be called Time at all . We are , indeed , perfectly familiar with the conception that one and the same thing may at one time possess a character which it does not possess at another , so that what is true of it at one time may not be true of it at another . We are , that is , familiar with the idea of a thing changing its character . But Time itself as a whole obviously cannot change its character in this sense . Mr . Bradley cannot mean to say that it possesses the character "which it exhibits" and in which it is unreal at one time , and possesses some other character , in which it is real , at some other time . And hence we might say it is certainly wrong to speak as if Time itself could have two incompatible characters; since nothing can have two incompatible characters , unless it has them at different times . And this is an objection which does seem to apply to Mr . Bradley's doctrine in any case , since he does in any case seem to imply this distinction between Time in one character and Time in another , whether this distinction is the complete explanation of our particular puzzle or not . Yet this objection would not necessarily be more than an objection to Mr . Bradley's words; it would not necessarily be an objection to his meaning . Where he seems to imply that Time , in some character other than that which it exhibits , may be fully real , he may only mean that something completely different from Time , but which does in some sense correspond to it , is fully real; and if he does mean this , our objection would only amount to an objection to his giving the name of "Time" to this supposed counterpart of Time; we might say , and I think justly , that it is misleading to speak of this counterpart of Time as if it were Time itself in some other character; but this would go no way at all to show that there may not really be such a counterpart of Time , which is real , while Time itself is unreal . We might ask , too , what this supposed counterpart of Time is like , or (to put it in Mr . Bradley's way) what the precise character is , in which Time Areal ? And I think Mr . Bradley would admit that he cannot tell us . But this , you see , would also be no objection to his actual doctrine . He might quite well know , and be right in saying , that there is and must be a real counterpart of Time , completely different in character from Time , as we know it , even though he has not the least idea what this counterpart is like . We must , therefore , admit that this proposed explanation of our puzzle would be a complete explanation of it . It would completely vindicate Mr . Bradley from the charge of inconsistency , and would give us , as his doctrine , a doctrine to which we have hitherto found no objection except verbal ones . But , nevertheless , I think it is a wrong explanation , and I want to explain why . If we were to suppose that this distinction between Time in one character and Time in another were the only one on which Mr . Bradley meant to rely , we should have as his doctrine this: We should have to suppose him to affirm most emphatically that Time , in the character which it exhibits , neither is real , nor exists , nor is a fact , nor is . We should have to suppose him to be using all these four expressions always as strict equivalents , and to mean that it is only in its other character that Time either exists , or is a fact , or is . And if he did mean this , there would , of course , be no doubt whatever that he does mean to contradict the common view with regard to Time; since , of course , what most people mean by "Time" is what he chooses to call "Time in the character which it exhibits ." Yet , his language , even in the passages that I quoted , seems to me to indicate that he does not mean this . I think , on the contrary , he means to affirm emphatically that Time even in the character which it exhibits , does exist , is a fact , and indubitably is , though it is not real in that character . In the second passage , for instance , where he insists so emphatically that appearances do exist , are facts , and indubitably are , he is , I think , plainly talking of appearances , in the character which they exhibit--or , as he there puts it , their nature , as it is--he does , I think , mean that appearances , even in this character , are facts , exist , and are , though , in this character , they are not "true of reality ." And , so again in the third passage , where he says , Change is a fact , and this fact , as such , is not reconcilable with the Absolute; this language is surely quite inexcusable , unless he means that Change , as such--change , in the character which it exhibits--change , as it is , is a fact: though , of course , he holds that in this character it certainly is not real . I think , therefore , we have to assume that Mr . Bradley means to make a distinction not merely between Time , in one character , and Time in another , but also between "real ," in one sense , and "real" in another . His meaning is not so simple as it would be , if he were merely making a distinction between Time in one character and Time in another , and it is not , after all , at all plain whether he means to contradict what ordinary people hold about Time or not . He does not mean to assert that Time , as such , neither is real , nor exists , nor is a fact , nor is; but , on the contrary , that Time , even as such , does exist , is a fact , and is; but , nevertheless , is not real . This , at least , is what I am going to assume him to mean . And on this assumption , we are brought face to face with the question as to the meaning of the word "real ," and also as to the meaning of these other words "exists ," "is a fact ," and "is ." Mr . Bradley seems to admit , we have seen , that "real" may sometimes be properly used as merely equivalent to these other phrases . We are , however , now supposing that he also holds that in another sense they are not equivalent , but that "real" means something more than the others , so that it is quite consistent to maintain that Time is not "real ," and yet does exist , is a fact , and is . In holding this I think he is mistaken; and what I want to do is to explain , as clearly as I can , what sort of a mistake I take him to be making , and what seems to me to be the source of this mistake . I may , perhaps , be quite wrong in thinking that Mr Bradley has made this mistake , and that it is in any degree the source of the distinction he seems to draw between "reality" and "existence ." To maintain that it is so is no part of my main object . My main object is simply to make clear the nature of this particular mistake , whether committed by Mr . Bradley or not , and that it is a mistake; because it seems to me that it is a mistake which it is very easy to make , and very important to avoid . I am , of course , not concerned at all to discuss the question whether Time is real or not , but only to discuss the question what sort of things would have to be true , if it were unreal , and whether if those things were true it could still be true that Time either exists , or is , or is a fact . Now , to begin with , I think I know pretty well , in part at least , what Mr . Bradley means when he says that it is unreal . I think that part at least of what he means is just what he ought to mean--just what anyone else would mean if he said that Time was unreal , and what any ordinary person would understand to be meant , if he heard those words . But I can conceive that , when I have explained as well as I can what this is that he ought to mean , some people may be inclined to dispute whether he means any such thing at all . They may say that he is using the word "real" exclusively in some highly unusual and special sense , so that in asserting that "Time is unreal" he is by no means denying any part of what ordinary people would mean by saying that "Time is real ." And that some special sense may come in to his meaning I am prepared to admit . I do think it is possible that part of what Mr . Bradley is asserting may be something which no unsophisticated person would think of expressing in the same way , and I will admit , therefore , that he does not , very likely , mean by "Time is unreal" merely what other people would mean by this phrase , but something else as well . What , however , I cannot help thinking is that , even if he means something more , he does mean what ordinary people would mean as well: that what they would mean is at least a part of his meaning . And if even this is disputed , if it is maintained that he is using the words exclusively in some special sense , I own I do not know how to argue the question . If anybody really does take the view that , when he says "Time is unreal ," absolutely all that he means is something which is in no way incompatible with what most people would mean by saying "Time is real ," I do not know how to show that this view is wrong . I can only say that if this had been all that he meant , I cannot believe that he would have expressed his view in the form "Time is unreal ." The only further argument I shall bring in favour of my view that he does mean what he ought to mean will take the form of an answer to one possible argument which might be brought against it . When I nave explained what he ought to mean by saying that "Time is unreal ," it will be quite clear that this is something which is in fact incompatible with the truth of the propositions that Time is , or exists , or is a fact . And it might be urged that the fact that it is thus incompatible is a strong argument against the view that Mr . Bradley does mean what he ought to mean , since , if he had meant it , he could hardly have failed to perceive that what he meant was inconsistent with these propositions , whereas , as we have seen , he certainly does not perceive this . I have an answer to that argument , which consists in giving an explanation , which I think a plausible one , as to how he could come to think that the propositions are not inconsistent , when in fact they are . What , then , ought Mr . Bradley to mean by "Time is unreal" ? What would most people mean by this proposition ? I do not think there is much difficulty in discovering what sort of thing they would mean by it . Of course , Time , with a big T , seems to be a highly abstract kind of entity , and to define exactly what can be meant by saying of an entity of that sort that it is unreal does seem to offer difficulties . But if you try to translate the proposition into the concrete , and to ask what it implies , there is , I think , very little doubt as to the sort of thing it implies . The moment you try to do this , and think what it really comes to , you at once begin thinking of a number of different kinds of propositions , all of which plainly must be untrue , if Time is unreal . If Time is unreal , then plainly nothing ever happens before or after anything else; nothing is ever simultaneous with anything else; it is never true that anything is past; never true that anything will happen in the future; never true that anything is happening now; and so on . You can at once think of a considerable number of kinds of propositions (and you could easily add to the list) , the falsehood of all of which is plainly implied by saying that Time is unreal . And it is clear , also , that to say that the falsehood of all propositions of these kinds is implied is equivalent to saying that there are no facts of certain corresponding kinds--no facts which consist in one event happening before another; none which consist in an event being past or future , and so on . That is to say , what "Time is unreal" implies is that , in the case of a large number of different properties which are such that , if they did belong to anything , what they belonged to would be facts having some common characteristic , which we might express by calling them "temporal facts ," the properties in question do , in fact , belong to nothing . It implies that the property of being a fact which consists in one event following another belongs to nothing; that that of being a past event belongs to nothing , and so on . And why it implies that all those different special properties belong to nothing is , I think we may say , because what it means is that the general property which I have called that of being a "temporal fact" belongs to nothing . To say that the property of being a temporal fact belongs to nothing does imply that such special properties as that of being a fact which consists in one event following another , or that of being a fact which consists in something being past , also belong to nothing; in exactly the same way as to say that the property of being "coloured" belongs to nothing implies with regard to the special properties "being red ," "being blue ," etc . , that they also belong to nothing . We may , then , I think , say that what "Time is unreal" means is simply "The property of being a temporal fact belongs to nothing ," or , to express this in the way in which it would be expressed in ordinary life , "There are no temporal facts ." And this being so , we have explained the usage of "unreal ," where it is predicated of Time with a capital T , by reference to a much more common and perfectly familiar usage of the term . The use of "is unreal" in the phrase "Time is unreal" has been defined by reference to its use in the phrase "Temporal facts are unreal ." And its use in this phrase is , so far as I can see , exactly the same as in hosts of phrases with which we are perfectly familiar; it is , I think , the commonest and by far the most important use of the term "unreal ." The use is that in which we use it when we say , "Unicorns are unreal ," "Griffins are unreal ," "Chimæras are unreal ," and so on . It is the usage in which unreal is equivalent to "imaginary"; and in which to say "Unicorns are unreal" means the same as "There are no unicorns" or "Unicorns do not exist ." In just the same way the proposition "Temporal facts are unreal ," into which we have translated "Time is unreal ," means the same as "There are no temporal facts ," or "Temporal facts do not exist ," or "Temporal facts are imaginary ." I think , then , that what Mr . Bradley ought to mean by "Time is unreal" can be defined by reference to one particular usage of the word "real" --or , if you like to put it that way , to one particular one among the conceptions for which the term "reality" may stand . And this particular conception seems to me to be by far the commonest and most important of those for which the term does stand . I want , therefore , before going on , to dwell a little upon its nature; although I daresay that all that I have to say is perfectly familiar and perfectly well understood by every one here . Of course , it has often been said before , but I think it is still very far from being generally understood . I think , perhaps , the point I want to insist on can be brought out in this way . I have just said that we have pointed out one particular one , and that the most important , among the conceptions for which the term "reality" may stand; and that is an excusable way of saying what we have done . But it would , I think , be more correct to say that we have pointed out one particular , and that the most important , usage of the terms "real" and "unreal ," and that one of the peculiarities of this usage is that it is such that the terms "real" and "unreal" cannot , when used in this way , be properly said to stand for any conception whatever . I will try to explain what I mean . We have said that what "Lions are real" means is that some particular property or other--I will say , for the sake of brevity , the property of being a lion , though that is not strictly accurate , does In fact belong to some-thing--that there are things which have it , or , to put it in another way , that the conception of being a lion is a conception which does apply to some things--that there are things which fall under it . And similarly what "Unicorns are unreal" means is that the property of being a unicorn belongs to nothing . Now , if this is so , then it seems to me , in a very important sense , "real" and "unreal" do not in this usage stand for any conceptions at all . The only conceptions which occur in the proposition "Lions are real" are , on this interpretation , plainly , (1) the conception of being a lion , and (2) the conception of belonging to something , and perfectly obviously "real" does not stand for either of these . In the case of the first that is obvious; but it is worth while pointing out that it is also true of the second . For if "is real" did stand for "belongs to something ," then the proposition "Lions are real" would stand , not for the assertion that the property of "being a lion" belongs to something , but for the assertion that lions themselves are properties which belong to something; and it is quite obvious that what we mean to assert is not any such nonsense as this . "Real ," therefore , does not , in this proposition , stand for the conception of "belonging to something" nor yet , quite plainly , does it stand for the conception of "being a lion ." And hence , since these are the only two conceptions which do occur in the proposition , we may , I think , say that "real ," in this usage , does not stand for any conception at all . To say that it did would be to imply that it stood for some property of which we are asserting that everything which has the property of "being a lion" also has this other property . But we are not , in fact , asserting any such thing . We are not asserting of any property called "reality" that it belongs to lions , as in the proposition "Lions are mammalian" we are asserting of the property of "being a mammal" that it belongs to lions . The two propositions "Lions are real" and "Lions are mammalian ," though grammatically similar , are in reality of wholly different forms; and one difference between them may be expressed by saying that whereas "mammalian" does stand for a property or conception , the very point of this usage of "real" is that it does not . To return to Mr . Bradley . "Time is unreal" ought to mean , according to me , "Temporal facts are unreal ," in the sense I have tried to explain . And I cannot help thinking that this which he ought to mean is , in part at least , what Mr . Bradley does mean when he says "Time is unreal ," though possibly be also means something else as well . But if so , it is quite clear , I think , that what he means is inconsistent with its being true that Time exists or that there is such a thing as Time . To say that Time exists or that there is such a thing , is to assert at least , that there are some temporal facts: it may assert more than this , but it does assert this , at least . And this , we have seen , is exactly what is denied when it is said that Time is unreal . "Time is unreal" just means "Temporal facts are unreal ," or "there are no temporal facts ," or "Temporal facts do not exist ." And just this is also what is meant by "Time does not exist" or "There is no such thing as Time ." There is , in fact , nothing , else for these expressions to mean . What , therefore , Mr . Bradley ought to mean and (according to me) does mean by "Time is unreal" is , in fact , inconsistent with what he ought to mean by "Time exists" or by "Time is ." And yet plainly he does not think that it is so . Is it possible to explain why he should have failed to perceive the inconsistency ? I think his failure can be explained as follows . It may have been noticed that , in the passages I quoted from him , he insists in one place , that to deny that appearances exist is not merely false but self-contradictory , and in another appeals to the principle that "any deliverance of consciousness is but a deliverance of consciousness" in support of his contention that what is a fact need , nevertheless , not be real . And the fact that he does these two things does , I think , give colour to the suggestion that the reason why he thinks that what is unreal may yet exist , and be a fact , and be , is the following . It is undoubtedly the case that , even if temporal facts are unreal , i .e . , there are no such things , we can and do think of them , just as it is undoubtedly the case that , though unicorns are unreal , we can and do imagine them . In other words , "temporal facts" and "unicorns" are both quite certainly "deliverances of consciousness ," at least in the sense that they are "objects of thought"; being "objects of thought" they are , in a wide sense , "appearances" also , and I cannot help thinking that Mr . Bradley supposes that , merely because they are so , they must at least BE . "How" (I imagine he would ask) "can a thing 'appear' or even 'be thought of' unless it is there to appear and to be thought of ? To say that it appears or is thought of , and that yet there is no such thing , is plainly self-contradictory . A thing cannot have a property , unless it is there to have it , and , since unicorns and temporal facts do have the property of being thought of , there certainly must be such things . When I think of a unicorn , what I am thinking of is certainly not nothing; if it were nothing , then , when I think of a griffin , I should also be thinking of nothing , and there would be no difference between thinking of a griffin and thinking of a unicorn . But there certainly is a difference; and what can the difference be except that in the one case what I am thinking of is a unicorn , and in the other a griffin ? And if the unicorn is what I am thinking of , then there certainly must be a unicorn , in spite of the fact that unicorns are unreal . In other words , though in one sense of the words there certainly are no unicorns--that sense , namely , in which to assert that there are would be equivalent to asserting that unicorns are real--yet there must be some other sense in which there are such things; since , if there were not , we could not think of them ." Perhaps , it may be thought that the fallacy involved in this argument is too gross for it to be possible that Mr . Bradley should have been guilty of it . But there are other passages in Appearance and Reality--particularly what he says about Error --which look to me as if he certainly was guilty of it . I suppose it will be quite obvious to everyone here that it is a fallacy; that the fact that we can think of unicorns is not sufficient to prove that , in any sense at all , there are any unicorns . Yet , I am not sure that I know myself what is the mistake involved in thinking that it is sufficient , and I am going , therefore , to try to put as clearly as I can , what I think it is , in the hope that somebody may be able , if I am wrong , to correct me . The main mistake , I suppose , is the mistake of thinking that the proposition "Unicorns are thought of" is a proposition of the same form as "Lions are hunted"; or the proposition "I am thinking of a unicorn" of the same form as "I am hunting a lion"; or the proposition "Unicorns are objects of thought" of the same form as "Lions are objects of the chase ." Of the second proposition in each of these three pairs , it is in fact the case that it could not be true unless there were lions--at least one . Each of them does , in fact , assert both with regard to a certain property--which we will call that of "being a lion"--that there are things which possess it , and also with regard to another--that of being hunted--that some of the things which possess the former possess this property too . But it is obvious enough to common sense that the same is by no means true of the first proposition in each pair , in spite of the fact that their grammatical expression shows no trace of the difference . It is perfectly obvious that if I say "I am thinking of a unicorn ," I am not saying both that there is a unicorn and that I am thinking of it , although , if I say "I am hunting a lion ," I am saying both that there is a lion , and that I am hunting it . In the former case , I am not asserting that the two properties of being a unicorn and of being thought of by me both belong to one and the same thing; whereas , in the latter case , I am asserting that the two properties of being a lion and of being hunted by me do belong to one and the same thing . It is quite clear that there is in fact , this difference between the two propositions; although no trace of it appears in their verbal expression . And why we should use the same form of verbal expression to convey such different meanings is more than I can say . It seems to me very curious that language , in this , as in the other instance which we have just considered of "Lions are real" and "Lions are mammalian ," should have grown up just as if it were expressly designed to mislead philosophers; and I do not know why it should have . Yet , it seems to me there is no doubt that in ever so many instances it has . Moreover , exactly what is meant by saying "I am thinking of a unicorn" is not by any means clear to me . I think we can assert at least this: In order that this proposition should be true , it is necessary (1) that I should be conceiving , with regard to a certain property , the hypothesis that there Is something which possesses it , and (2) that the property in question should be such that , if anything did possess it there would be a unicorn . Although this is plainly true , it does not give us completely what is meant by the statement , "I am thinking of a unicorn"; and I do not know what the complete meaning is . It is certainly not that I am conceiving with regard to the property of "being a unicorn ," that there is something which possesses it; since I may be thinking of a unicorn , without ever having conceived the property of "being a unicorn" at all . Whatever it does mean , the point which concerns us is that it is certainly not necessary for its truth , that the property of being a unicorn should , in fact , belong to anything whatever , or , therefore , that there should in any sense whatever be a unicorn . And the fallacy I am attributing to Mr . Bradley is that of supposing that , in some sense , it must imply this latter . This , then , is what I imagine to be at least one of the reasons which have led Mr . Bradley to suppose that the proposition "Time is unreal ," must be consistent with the proposition "There is such a thing as Time ." Put shortly , it is that he sees (what is perfectly true) that "Time is unreal" must be consistent with "We do think of Time;" he thinks (falsely) that "We do think of Time" must imply , in some sense , "There is such a thing as Time;" and finally , infers (correctly) from this true and this false premiss , that there must be some sense of the proposition "There is such a thing as Time" which is consistent with "Time is unreal ." It follows , then , that if Mr . Bradley means what he ought mean both by "Time is unreal" and by "Time exists ," he is contradicting himself when he combines these two propositions . And I have said I feel convinced that he does mean what he ought to mean by the former . But I feel a good deal of doubt as to whether , all the same , he is contradicting himself , because it does seem to me doubtful whether he means what he ought to mean by the latter . The kind of thing which I imagine may be happening to him when he insists so strongly that Time does exist , is a fact , and is , is that , properly speaking , he is not attaching to these phrases any meaning whatever--not , therefore , that which they properly bear . It seems to me very possible that he has so strongly convinced himself of the false proposition that there must be some sense in which , if I think of a unicorn , there must be a unicorn , that wherever he knows the former proposition holds , he allows himself to use the latter form of words , without attaching any meaning to them . What he is really asserting so emphatically may , I think , be not anything which his words stand for , but simply this verbal proposition that there must be some sense in which they are true .

SOME JUDGMENTS OF PERCEPTION I want to raise some childishly simple questions as to what we are doing when we make judgments of a certain kind , which we all do in fact exceedingly commonly make . The kind of judgments I mean are those which we make when , with regard to something which we are seeing , we judge such things as '"That is an inkstand ," "That is a tablecloth ," "That is a door ," etc . , etc .; or when , with regard to something which we are feeling with our hands , we judge such things as "This is cloth ," "This is a finger ," "This is a coin ," etc . , etc . It is scarcely possible , I think , to exaggerate the frequency with which we make such judgments as these , nor yet the certainty with which we are able to make vast numbers of them . Any man , who is not blind , can , at almost any moment of his waking life , except when he is in the dark , make a large number of judgments of the first kind , with the greatest certainty . He has only to look about him , if he is indoors , to judge with regard to various things which he is seeing , such things as "That is a window ," "That is a chair ," "This is a book"; or , if he is out-of-doors , such things as "That is a house ," "That is a motor-car ," "That is a man ," or "That is a stone ," "That is a tree ," "That is a cloud ." And all of us , who are not blind , do in fact constantly make such judgments , even if , as a rule , we only make them as parts of more complicated judgments . What I mean is that , when we make such judgments as "Hullo! that clock has stopped ," or "This chair is more comfortable than that one ," or "That man looks like a foreigner ," judgments of the simpler kind with which I am concerned are , so far as I can see , actually a part of what we are judging . In judging "That clock has stopped ," part of what I am actually judging is , so far as I can see , "That is a clock;" and similarly if I judge "That tree is taller than this one ," my judgment actually contains the two simpler judgments "That is a tree ," and "This is a tree ." Perhaps most judgments which we make , of the kind I mean , are , in this way , only parts of more complicated judgments: I do not know whether this is so or not . But in any case there can be no doubt that we make them exceedingly commonly . And even a blind man , or a man in the dark , can and does , very frequently , make judgments of the second kind--judgments about things which he is feeling with his hands . All of us , for instance , at almost any moment of our waking life , whether we are in the dark or not , have only to feel certain parts of our own bodies or of our clothes , in order to make , with great certainty , such judgments as "This is a finger ," "This is a nose ," "This is cloth ." And similarly I have only to feel in my pockets to judge , with regard to objects which I meet with there , such things as "This is a coin ," "This is a pencil ," "This is a pipe ." Judgments of this kind would , I think , commonly , and rightly , be taken to be judgments , the truth of which involves the existence of material things or physical objects . If I am right in judging that this is an inkstand , it follows that there is at least one inkstand in the Universe; and if there is an inkstand in the Universe , it follows that there is in it at least one material thing or physical object . This may , of course , be disputed . Berkeley , if I understand him rightly , was clearly of opinion that there was no inconsistency in maintaining that there were in the Universe thousands of inkstands and trees and stones and stars , and that yet there was in it no such thing as matter . And perhaps the definition of matter , which he adopted , was such that there really was no inconsistency in maintaining this . Perhaps , similarly , other philosophers have sometimes adopted definitions of the expressions "material things" and "physical objects ," which were such that all the judgments of this kind that we make might quite well be true , without its being true that there are in the Universe any material things whatever . Perhaps , even , there may be some justification for adopting definitions of those terms which would yield the surprising result that we may , with perfect consistency , maintain that the world is full of minerals and vegetables and animals , of all sorts of different kinds , and that yet there is not to be found in it a single material thing . I do not know whether there is or is not any utility in using the terms "material thing" or "physical object" in such a sense as this . But , whether there is or not , I cannot help thinking that there is ample justification for using them in another sense--a sense in which from the proposition that there are in the Universe such things as inkstands or fingers or clouds , it strictly follows that there are in it at least as many material things , and in which , therefore , we can not consistently maintain the existence of inkstands , fingers , and clouds , while denying that of material things . The kinds of judgment which I have mentioned , and thousands of others which might easily be mentioned , are obviously all of the same sort in one very important respect--a respect in which , for instance , such judgments as "This is an emotion ," "This is a judgment ," "This is a colour ," are not of the same sort as they are . And it seems to me that we are certainly using the term "material thing" in a correct and useful way , if we express this important common property which they have , by saying that of each of them the same can truly be said as was said of the judgment "That is an inkstand": that , just as from the proposition "There is an inkstand" it follows that there is at least one material thing , so from the proposition "There is a tablecloth ," it follows that there is at least one material thing; and similarly in all the other cases . We can certainly use the expression "Things such as inkstands , tablecloths , fingers , clouds , stars , etc . ," to mean things such as these in a certain very important respect , which we all understand , though we may not be able to define it . And the term "material thing" certainly is and can be correctly used to mean simply things such as these in that respect--whatever it may be . Some term is certainly required to mean merely things such as these in that important respect; and , so far as I can see , there is no term which can be naturally used in this sense except the term "material things" and its equivalents . Thus understood , the term "material thing" certainly does stand for an important notion , which requires a name . And , if we agree to use the term in this sense , then it is obvious that no more can be necessary for the truth of the assertion that there are material things , than is necessary for the truth of judgments of the kind with which I propose to deal . But no more can be necessary for the truth of these judgments than is actually asserted in or logically implied by them . And if we approach the question what is necessary for the truth of the assertion that there are material things , by asking what it is that we actually assert when we make such judgments as these , certain reasons for doubting how much is necessary are , I think , brought out much more clearly , than if we approach the question in any other way . Many philosophers have told us a very great deal as to what they suppose to be involved in the existence of material things; and some , at least , among them seem to have meant by "material things" such things as inkstands , fingers and clouds . But I can think of only one type of view as to the constitution of material things , which is such that it is tolerably clear what answer those who hold it would give to the simple question; What is it that I am judging , when I judge , as I now do , that that is an inkstand ? The type of view I mean is that to which the view that Mill suggests , when he explains what he means by saying that Matter is a Permanent Possibility of Sensation , and also the view or views which Mr . Russell seems to suggest in his "Our Knowledge of the External World ," seem to belong . In the case of views of this kind , it is , I think , tolerably clear what answer those who hold them would give to all the questions I want to raise about judgments of the kind I have described . But it does not seem to me at all certain that any view of this type is true; and certainly many philosophers have held and do hold that all views of this type are false . But in the case of those who do hold them to be false , I do not know , in any single case , what answer would be given to all the questions which I want to raise . In the case of philosophers , who do not accept any view of the Mill-Russell type , none , so far as I know , has made it clear what answer he would give to all my questions: some have made it clear what answer they would give to some of them; but many , I think , have not even made it clear what answer they would give to any . Perhaps there is some simple and satisfactory answer , which has escaped me , that such philosophers could give to all my questions; but I cannot help thinking that assumptions as to the nature of material things have too often been made , without its even occurring to those who made them to ask , what , if they were true , we could be judging when we make such judgments as these; and that , if this question had been asked , it would have become evident that those assumptions were far less certain than they appeared to be . I do not know that there is any excuse whatever for calling all judgments of the kind I mean "judgments of perception ." All of them are , of course , judgments about things which we are at the moment perceiving , since , by definition , they are judgments about things which we are seeing or feeling with our hands; and all of them are , no doubt , also based upon something which we perceive about the thing in question . But the mere fact that a judgment is both about a thing which I am perceiving , and also based upon something which I perceive about that thing , does not seem to be a sufficient reason for calling it a judgment of perception; and I do not know that there is any other reason than this for calling all judgments of the kind I mean judgments of perception . I do not want therefore , to assert that all of them are so . But it seems to me quite plain that enormous numbers of them are so , in a perfectly legitimate sense . This judgment , which I now make , to the effect that that is a door , seems to me quite plainly to be a judgment of perception , in the simple sense that I make it because I do , in fact , see that that is a door , and assert in it no more than what I see; and what I see I , of course , perceive . In every case in which I judge , with regard to something which I am seeing or feeling with my hands , that it is a so-and-so , simply because I do perceive , by sight or touch , that it is in fact a thing of that kind , we can , I think , fairly say that the judgment in question is a judgment of perception . And enormous numbers of judgments of the kind I mean are , quite plainly , judgments of perception in this sense . They are not all , for the simple reason that some of them are mistaken . I may , for instance , judge , with regard to an animal which I see at a distance , that it is a sheep , when in fact it is a pig . And here my judgment is certainly not due to the fact that I see it to be a sheep; since I cannot possibly see a thing to be a sheep , unless it is one . It , therefore , is not a judgment of perception in this sense . And moreover , even where such a judgment is true , it may not always be a judgment of perception , for the reason that , whereas I only see the thing in question , the kind of thing which I judge it to be is of such a nature , that it is impossible for any one , by sight alone , to perceive anything to be of that kind . How to draw the line between judgments of this kind , which are judgments of perception , and those which are not , I do not know . That is to say , I do not know what conditions must be fulfilled in order that I may be truly said to be perceiving , by sight or touch , such things as that that is a door , this is a finger , and not merely inferring them . Some people may no doubt think that it is very unphilosophical in me to say that we ever can perceive such things as these . But it seems to me that we do , in ordinary life , constantly talk of seeing such things , and that , when we do so , we are neither using language incorrectly , nor making any mistake about the facts--supposing something to occur which never does in fact occur . The truth seems to me to be that we are using the term "perceive" in a way which is both perfectly correct and expresses a kind of thing which constantly does occur , only that some philosophers have not recognised that this is a correct usage of the term and have not been able to define it . I am not , therefore , afraid to say that I do now perceive that that is a door , and that that is a finger . Only , of course , when I say that I do , I do not mean to assert that part of what I "perceive ," when I "perceive" these things , may not be something which , in an important sense , is known to me only by inference . It would be very rash to assert that "perception ," in this sense of the word , entirely excludes inference . All that seems to me certain is that there is an important and useful sense of the word "perception ," which is such that the amount and kind of inference , if inference there be , which is involved in my present perception that that is a door , is no bar to the truth of the assertion that I do perceive that it is one . Vast numbers , then , of the kind of judgments with which I propose to deal seem to me to be , in an important and legitimate sense , judgments of perception; although I am not prepared to define , any further than I have done , what that sense is . And though it is true that the questions which I shall raise apply just as much to those of them which are not judgments of perception as to those which are , it is , of course , also true that they apply just as much to those which are as to those which are not; so that I shall be really dealing with a large and important class among judgments of perception . It is true that , if certain views which , if I understand them rightly , some Philosophers have seriously entertained , were true ones , it would be quite impossible that any of them should be judgments of perception . For some philosophers seem to me to have denied that we ever do in fact know such things as these , and others not only that we ever know them but also that they are ever true . And , if , in fact , I never do know such a thing , or if it is never true , it will of course , follow that I never perceive such a thing; since I certainly cannot , in this sense , perceive anything whatever , unless I both know it and it is true . But it seems to me a sufficient refutation of such views as these , simply to point to cases in which we do know such things . This , after all , you know , really is a finger: there is no doubt about it: I know it , and you all know it . And I think we may safely challenge any philosopher to bring forward any argument in favour either of the proposition that we do not know it , or of the proposition that it is not true , which does not at some point , rest upon some premiss which is , beyond comparison , less certain than is the proposition which it is designed to attack . The questions whether we do ever know such things as these , and whether there are any material things , seem to me , therefore , to be questions which there is no need to take seriously: they are questions which it is quite easy to answer , with certainty , in the affirmative . What does , I think , need to be taken seriously , and what is really dubious , is not the question , whether this is a finger , or whether I know that it is , but the question what , in certain respects , I am knowing , when I know that it is . And this is the question to which I will now address myself . To begin with there is one thing which seems to me to be very certain indeed about such judgments . It is unfortunately a thing which I do not know how properly to express . There seem to me to be objections to every way of expressing it which I can think of . But I hope I may be able to make my meaning clear , in spite of the inadequacy of my expression . The thing I mean is a thing which may to some people seem so obvious as to be scarcely worth saying . But I cannot help thinking that it is not always clearly recognised , and even that some philosophers , to judge from what they say , might perhaps dispute it . It seems to me to be an assumption which is silently made in many treatments of the subject , and , as I say , it seems to me to be very certain indeed . But I think it is at all events worth while to try to make the assumption explicit , in case it should be disputed . If it really is not true , then the other questions to which I shall go on , and which seem to me really dubious and difficult , do not , I think , arise at all . I will try to express this fundamental assumption , which seems to me so very certain , by saying it is the assumption that , in all cases in which I make a judgment of this sort , I have no difficulty whatever in picking out a thing , which is , quite plainly , in a sense in which nothing else is , the thing about which I am making my judgment; and that yet , though this thing is the thing about which I am judging , I am , quite certainly , not , in general , judging with regard to it , that it is a thing of that kind for which the term , which seems to express the predicate of my judgment , is a name . Thus , when I judge , as now , that That is an inkstand , I have no difficulty whatever in picking out , from what , if you like , you can call my total field of presentation at the moment , an object , which is undoubtedly , in a sense in which nothing else is , the object about which I am making this judgment; and yet it seems to me quite certain that of this object I am not judging that it is a whole inkstand . And similarly when I judge , with regard to something which I am feeling in my pocket , "This is a coin ," I have no difficulty in picking out , from my field of presentation , an object , which is undoubtedly the object with which my judgment is concerned; and yet I am certainly not judging with regard to this object that it is a whole coin . I say that alwayst when I make such a judgment , I can pick out the one , among the objects presented to me at the time , about which I am making it; but I have only said that in general I am not judging with regard to this object that it is a thing of the kind , for which the term , which seems to express the predicate of my judgment , is a name . And I have limited my second proposition in this way , because there are cases , in which it does not , at first sight , seem quite so certain that I am not doing this , as in the two instances I have just given . When , for instance , I judge with regard to something , which I am seeing , "This is a soap-bubble ," or "This is a drop of water ," or even when I judge "This is a spot of ink ," it may not seem quite so plain , that I may not be judging , with regard to the very object presented to me , that it is , itself , a whole soap-bubble , a whole drop of water , or a whole spot of ink , as it always is , in the case of an inkstand , or a coin , that I never take the presented object , about which I am judging , to be a whole inkstand , or a whole coin . The sort of reason why I say this will , of course , be obvious to any one , and it is obviously of a childish order . But I cannot say that it seems to me quite obvious that in such a case I am not judging of the presented object that it is a whole drop of water , in the way in which it does seem to be obvious that I am not judging of this presented object that it is an inkstand . That is why I limit myself to saying that , in general , when I judge "That is a so-and-so" I am not judging with regard to the presented object , about which my judgment is that it is a thing of the kind in question . As much as this seems to me to be a thing which any child can see . Nobody will suppose , for a moment , that when he judges such things as "This is a sofa ," or "This is a tree ," he is judging , with regard to the presented object about which his judgment plainly is , that it is a whole sofa or a whole tree: he can , at most , suppose that he is judging it to be a part of the surface of a sofa or a part of the surface of a tree . And certainly in the case of most judgments of this kind which we make , whether in the case of all or not , this is plainly the case: we are not judging , with regard to the presented object about which our judgment plainly is , that it is a thing of the kind , for which the term which appears to express the predicate of our judgment , is a name . And that this should be true of most judgments of this kind , whether of all or not , is quite sufficient for my purpose . This much , then , seems to me to be very certain indeed . But I will try to make clearer exactly what I mean by it , by mentioning a ground on which I imagine it might perhaps be disputed . The object of which I have spoken as the object , about which , in each particular case , such a judgment as this always is a judgment , is , of course , always an object of the kind which some philosophers would call a sensation , and others would call a sense-datum . Whether all philosophers , when they talk of sensations , mean to include among them such objects as these , I do not know . Some , who have given a great deal of attention to the subject , and for whom I have a great respect , talk of sensations in such a way , that I cannot be sure what they are talking about at all or whether there are such things . But many , I think , undoubtedly do mean to include such subjects as these . No doubt , in general , when they call them sensations , they mean to attribute to them properties , which it seems to me extremely doubtful whether they possess . And perhaps even those who call them sense-data , may , in part , be attributing to them properties which it may be doubtful whether they possess . If we want to define a sensation or a sense-datum , in a manner which will leave it not open to doubt what sort of things we are talking of , and that there are such things , I do not know that we can do it better than by saying that sense-data are the sort of things , about which such judgments as these always seem to be made--the sort of things which seem to be the real or ultimate subjects of all such judgments . Such a way of defining how the term "sense-datum" is used , may not seem very satisfactory; but I am inclined to think it may be as satisfactory as any which can be found . And it is certainly calculated to obviate some misunderstandings which may arise; since everybody can see , I think , what the thing is which I am describing as the thing about which he is making his judgment , when he judges "That is an inkstand ," and that there is such a thing , even if he does not agree that this description applies to it . I can , in fact , imagine that some of those who would call this thing a sensation would deny that my judgment is about it at all . It would sometimes be spoken of as the sensation which mediates my perception of this inkstand in this instance . And I can imagine that some of those who would so speak of it might be inclined to say that when I judge "This is an inkstand ," my judgment is about this inkstand which I perceive , and not , in any sense at all , about the sensation which mediates my perception of it . They may perhaps imagine that the sensation mediates my perception of the inkstand only in the sense that it brings the inkstand before my mind in such a way that , once it is before my mind , I can make a judgment about it , which is not a judgment about the mediating sensation at all; and that such a judgment is the one I am actually expressing when I say "This is an inkstand ." Such a view , if it is held , seems to me to be quite certainly false , and is what I have intended to deny . And perhaps I can put most clearly the reason why it seems to me false , by saying that , if (which may be doubted) there is anything which is this inkstand , that thing is certainly not given to me independently of this sense-datum , in such a sense that I can possibly make a judgment about it which is not a judgment about this sense-datum . I am not , of course , denying that I do perceive this inkstand , and that my judgment is , in a sense , a judgment about it . Both these things seem to me to be quite obviously true . I am only maintaining that my judgment is also , in another sense , a judgment about this sense-datum which mediates my perception of the inkstand . Those who say that this sense-datum does mediate my perception of the inkstand , would , of course , admit that my perception of the inkstand is , in a sense , dependent upon the sense-datum; that it is dependent is implied in the mere statement that it is mediated by it . But it might be maintained that it is dependent on it only in the sense in which , when the idea of one object is called up in my mind , through association , by the idea of another , the idea which is called up is dependent on the idea which calls it up . What I wish to maintain , and what seems to me to be quite certainly true , is that my perception of this inkstand is dependent on this sense-datum , in a quite different and far more intimate sense than this . It is dependent on it in the sense that , if there is anything which is this inkstand , then , in perceiving that thing , I am knowing it only as the thing which stands in a certain relation to this sense-datum . When the idea of one object is called up in my mind by the idea of another , I do not know the second object only as the thing which has a certain relation to the first: on the contrary , I can make a judgment about the second object , which is not a judgment about the first . And similarly in the case of two sense-data which are presented to me simultaneously , I do not know the one only as a thing which has a certain relation to the other . But in the case of this sense-datum and this inkstand the case seems to me to be plainly quite different . If there be a thing which is this inkstand at all , it is certainly only known to me as the thing which stands in a certain relation to this sense-datum . It is not given to me , in the sense in which this sense-datum is given . If there be such a thing at all , it is quite certainly only known to me by description , in the sense in which Mr . Russell uses that phrase; and the description by which it is known is that of being the thing which stands to this sense-datum in a certain relation . That is to say , when I make such a judgment as "This inkstand is a good big one"; what I am really judging is: "There is a thing which stands to this in a certain relation , and which is an inkstand , and that thing is a good big one"--where "this" stands for this presented object . I am referring to or identifying the thing which is this inkstand , if there be such a thing at all , only as the thing which stands to this sense-datum in a certain relation; and hence my judgment , though in one sense it may be said to be a judgment about the inkstand , is quite certainly also , in another sense , a judgment about this sense-datum . This seems to me so clear , that I wonder how anyone can deny it; and perhaps nobody would . But I cannot help thinking that it is not clear to everybody; partly because , so far as I can make out , nobody before Mr . Russell had pointed out the extreme difference there is between a judgment about a thing known only by description to the individual who makes the judgment , and a judgment about a thing not known to him only in this way; and partly because so many people seem still utterly to have failed to understand what the distinction is which he expresses in this way . I will try to make the point clear , in a slightly different way . Suppose I am seeing two coins , lying side by side , and am not perceiving them in any other way except by sight . It will be plain to everybody , I think , that , when I identify the one as "This one" and the other as "That one ," I identify them only by reference to the two visual presented objects , which correspond respectively to the one and to the other . But what may not , I think , be realised , is that the sense in which I identify them by reference to the corresponding sense-data , is one which involves that every judgment which I make about the one is a judgment about the sense-datum which corresponds to it , and every judgment I make about the other , a judgment about the sense-datum which corresponds to it: I simply cannot make a judgment about either , which is not a judgment about the corresponding sense-datum . But if the two coins were given to me , in the sense in which the two sense-data are , this would certainly not be the case . I can identify and distinguish the two sense-data directly , this as this one , and that as that one: I do not need to identify either as the thing which has this relation to this other thing . But I certainly cannot thus directly identify the two coins . I have not four things presented to me (1) this sense-datum , (2) that sense-datum , (3) this coin , and (4) that coin , but two only--this sense-datum and that sense-datum . When , therefore , I judge "This is a coin ," my judgment is certainly a judgment about the one sense-datum , and when I judge "And that is also a coin ," it is certainly a judgment about the other . Only , in spite of what my language might seem to imply , I am certainly not judging either of the one sense-datum that it is a whole coin , nor yet of the other that it is one . This , then , seems to me fundamentally certain about judgments of this kind . Whenever we make such a judgment we can easily pick out an object (whether we call it a sensation or a sense-datum , or not) , which is , in an easily intelligible sense , the object which is the real or ultimate subject of our judgment; and yet , in many cases at all events , what we are judging with regard to this object is certainly not that it is an object of the kind , for which the term which appears to express the predicate of our judgment is a name . But if this be so , what is it that I am judging , in all such cases , about the presented object , which is the real or ultimate subject of my judgment ? It is at this point that we come to questions which seem to me to be really uncertain and difficult to answer . To begin with , there is one answer which is naturally suggested by the reason I have given for saying that , in this case , it is quite obvious that I am not judging , with regard to this presented object , that it is an inkstand , whereas it is not in the same way , quite obvious that , in making such a judgment as "This is a soap-bubble" or "This is a drop of water ," I may not be judging , of the object about which my judgment is , that that very object really is a soap-bubble or a drop of water . The reason I gave is that it is quite obvious that I do not take this presented object to be a whole inkstand: that , at most , I only take it to be part of the surface of an inkstand . And this reason naturally suggests that the true answer to our question may be that what I am judging of the presented object is just that it is a part of the surface of an inkstand . This answer seems to me to be obviously on quite a different level from the suggestion that I am judging it really to be an inkstand . It is not childishly obvious that I am not judging it to be part of the surface of an inkstand , as it is that I am not judging it to be an inkstand--a whole one . On this view , when I say such things as "That is an inkstand ," "That is a door ," "This is a coin ," these expressions would really only be a loose way of saying "That is part of the surface of an inkstand ," "That is part of the surface of a door ," "This is part of the surface of a coin ." And there would , I think , plainly be nothing surprising in the fact that we should use language thus loosely . What , at first sight , appears to be a paradox , namely that , whereas I appear to be asserting of a given thing that it is of a certain kind , I am not really asserting of the thing in question that it is of that kind at all , would be susceptible of an easy explanation . And moreover , if this view were true , it would offer an excellent illustration of the difference between a thing known only by description and a thing not so known , and would show how entirely free from mystery that distinction is . On this view , when I judge "That inkstand is a good big one" I shall in effect be judging: "There is one and only one inkstand of which this is part of the surface , and the inkstand of which this is true is a good big one ." It would be quite clear that the part of the surface of the inkstand was given to me in a sense in which the whole was not , just as it is in fact clear that I do now "see" this part of the surface of this inkstand , in a sense in which I do not "see" the whole; and that my judgment , while it is , in fact , about both the whole inkstand , and also about one particular part of its surface , is about them in two entirely different senses . This view is one , which it is at first sight , I think , very natural to suppose to be true . But before giving the reasons , why , nevertheless , it seems to me extremely doubtful , I think it is desirable to try to explain more precisely what I mean by it . The word "part" is one which is often used extremely vaguely in philosophy; and I can imagine that some people would be willing to assent to the proposition that this sense-datum really is , in some sense or other , a "part" of this inkstand , and that what I am judging with regard to it , when I judge "This is an inkstand ," is , in effect , "There is an inkstand , of which this is a part ," who would be far from allowing that this can possibly be what I am judging , when once they understand what the sense is in which I am here using the word "part ." What this sense is , I am quite unable to define; but I hope I may be able to make my meaning sufficiently clear , by giving instances of things which are undoubtedly "parts" of other things in the sense in question . There is , it seems to me , a sense of the word "part ," in which we all constantly use the word with perfect precision , and , which , therefore , we all understand very well , however little we may be able to define it . It is the sense in which the trunk of any tree is undoubtedly a part of that tree; in which this finger of mine is undoubtedly a part of my hand , and my hand a part of my body . This is a sense in which every part of a material thing or physical object is itself a material thing or physical object; and it is , so far as I can see , the only proper sense in which a material thing can be said to have parts . The view which I wish to discuss is the view that I am judging this presented object to be a part of an inkstand , in this sense . And the nature of the view can perhaps be brought out more clearly , by mentioning one important corollary which would follow from it . I am , of course , at this moment , seeing many parts of the surface of this inkstand . But all these parts , except one , are , in fact , themselves parts of that one . That one is the one of which we should naturally speak as "the part of the surface that I am now seeing" or as "this part of the surface of this inkstand ." There is only one part of the surface of this inkstand , which does thus contain , as parts , all the other parts that I am now seeing . And , if it were true that I am judging this presented object to be a part of the surface of an inkstand at all , in the sense I mean , it would follow that this presented object must , if my judgment "This is an inkstand" be true (as it certainly is) , be identical with this part , which contains all the other parts which I am seeing; since there is plainly no other part with which it could possibly be identified . That is to say , if I am really judging of this presented object that it is part of the surface of an inkstand , in the sense I mean , it must be the case that everything which is true of what I should call "this part of the surface of this inkstand" is , in fact , true of this presented object . This view , therefore , that what we are judging of the ultimate subject of our judgment , when we judge "This is a so-and-so ," is , in general , merely that the subject in question is a part of a thing of the kind in question , can , I think , be most clearly discussed , by asking whether , in this case , this presented object can really be identical with this part of the surface of this inkstand . If it can't , then most certainly I am not judging of it that it is a part of the surface of an inkstand at all . For my judgment , whatever it is , is true . And yet , if this presented object is not identical with this part of the surface of this inkstand , it certainly is not a part of an inkstand at all; since there is no other part , either of this inkstand or of any other , with which it could possibly be supposed to be identical . Can we , then , hold that this sense-datum really is identical with this part of the surface of this inkstand ? That everything which is true of the one is true of the other ? An enormous number of very familiar arguments have been used by various philosophers , which , if they were sound , would show that we can not . Some of these arguments seem to me to be quite clearly not sound--all , for instance , which rest either on the assumption that this sense-datum can only exist so long as it is perceived , or on the assumption that it can only exist so long as it is perceived by me . Of others I suspect that they may have some force , though I am quite unable to see that they have any . Such , for instance , are all those which assume either that this sense-datum is a sensation or feeling of mine , in a sense which includes the assertion that it is dependent on my mind in the very same sense in which my perception of it obviously is so; or that it is causally dependent on my body in the sense in which my perception of it admittedly is so . But others do seem to me to have great force . I will , however , confine myself to trying to state one , which seems to me to have as much as any . It will be found that this one involves an assumption , which does seem to me to have great force , but which yet seems to me to be doubtful . So far as I know , all good arguments against the view that this sense-datum really is identical with this part of the surface of the inkstand , do involve this same assumption , and have no more force than it has . But in this , of course , I may be wrong . Perhaps some one will be able to point out an argument , which is obviously quite independent of it , and which yet has force . The argument I mean involves considerations which are exceedingly familiar , so familiar that I am afraid every one may be sick of hearing them alluded to . But , in spite of this fact , it seems to me not quite easy to put it quite precisely , in a way which will distinguish it clearly from other arguments involving the same familiar considerations , but which do not seem to me to be equally cogent . I want , therefore , to try to put it with a degree of precision , which will prevent irrelevant objections from being made to it--objections which would , I think , be relevant against some of these other arguments , but are not , I think , relevant against it . The fact is that we all , exceedingly commonly , when , at each of two times , separated by a longer or shorter interval , we see a part of the surface of a material thing , in the sense in which I am now seeing this part of the surface of this inkstand , or when at one time we see such a surface and at another perceive one by touch , make , on the second occasion , the judgment "This part of a surface is the same part of the surface of the same thing , as that which I was seeing (or perceiving by touch) just now ." How commonly we all do this can scarcely be exaggerated . I look at this inkstand , and then I look again , and on the second occasion I judge "This part of the surface of this inkstand is the same as , or at least contains a part which is the same as a part of , the part of its surface which I was seeing just now ." Or I look at this finger and then I touch it , and I judge , on the second occasion , "This part of the surface of this finger is the same as one of those I was seeing just now ." We all thus constantly identify a part of a surface of a material thing which we are perceiving at one time with a part which we were perceiving at another . Now , when we do this--when we judge "This is the same part of the same thing as I was seeing or touching just now ," we , of course , do not mean to exclude the possibility that the part in question may have changed during the interval; that it is really different , on the second occasion , either in shape or size or quality , or in all three , from what it was on the first . That is to say , the sense of sameness which we are here concerned with is one which clearly does not exclude change . We may even be prepared to assert , on general grounds , in all such cases , that the surface in question certainly must have changed . But nevertheless there is a great difference in one respect , between two kinds of such cases , both of which occur exceedingly commonly . If I watch somebody blowing air into a child's balloon , it constantly happens , at certain stages in the process , that I judge with regard to the part of the surface which I am seeing at that stage , not only that it is larger than it was at an earlier stage , but that it is perceptibly larger . Or , if I pull the face of an india-rubber doll , I may judge at a certain stage in the process that the patch of red colour on its cheek not only is different in shape from what it was at the beginning , but is perceptibly so; it may , for instance , be a perceptibly flatter ellipse than it was to start with . Or , if I watch a person blushing , I may judge at a certain stage that a certain part of the surface of his face not only is different in colour from what it was , when I saw it before he began to blush , but is perceptibly so--perceptibly redder . In enormous numbers of cases we do thus judge of a surface seen at a given time that it is thus perceptibly different in size , or in shape , or in colour , from what it was when we saw it before . But cases are at least equally numerous in which , though we might , on general grounds be prepared to assert that it must have changed in some respect , we should not be prepared to assert that it had , in any respect whatever , changed perceptibly . Of this part of this surface of this inkstand , for instance , I am certainly not prepared to assert that it is now perceptibly different in any respect from what it was when I saw it just now . And similar cases are so numerous that I need not give further instances . We can , therefore , divide cases , in which we judge , of a part of a surface which we are seeing , "This is the same part of the surface of the same material thing as the one I saw just now ," into cases where we should also judge "But it is perceptibly different from what it was then ," and cases in which , even though we might assert "It must be different ," we are certainly not prepared to assert that it is perceptibly so . But now let us consider the cases in which we are not prepared to assert that the surface in question has changed perceptibly . The strange fact , from which the argument I mean is drawn , is that , in a very large number of such cases , it seems as if it were unmistakably true that the presented object , about which we are making our judgment when we talk of "This surface" at the later time , is perceptibly different , from that about which we are making it when we talk of the surface I saw just now . If , at the later time , I am at a sufficiently greater distance from the surface , the presented object which corresponds to it at the time seems to be perceptibly smaller , than the one which corresponded to it before . If I am looking at it from a sufficiently oblique angle , the later presented object often seems to be perceptibly different in shape--a perceptibly flatter ellipse , for instance . If I am looking at it , with blue spectacles on , when formerly I had none , the later presented object seems to be perceptibly different in colour from the earlier one . If I am perceiving it by touch alone , whereas formerly I was perceiving it by sight alone , the later presented object seems to be perceptibly different from the earlier , in respect of the fact that it is not coloured at all , whereas the earlier was , and that , on the other hand , it has certain tactual qualities , which the earlier had not got . All this seems to be as plain as it can be , and yet it makes absolutely no difference to the fact that of the surface in question we are not prepared to judge that it is perceptibly different from what it was . Sometimes , of course , where there seems to be no doubt that the later presented object is perceptibly different from the earlier , we may not notice that it is so . But even where we do notice the apparent difference , we do still continue to judge of the surface in question: This surface is not , so far as I can tell with certainty by perception , in any way different from what it was when I saw it or touched it just now; I am not prepared to assert that it has changed perceptibly . It seems , therefore , to be absolutely impossible that the surface seen at the later time should be identical with the object presented then , and the surface seen at the earlier identical with the object presented then , for the simple reason that , whereas with regard to the later seen surface I am not prepared to judge that it is in any way perceptibly different from that seen earlier , it seems that with regard to the later sense-datum I cannot fail to judge that it is perceptibly different from the earlier one: the fact that they are perceptibly different simply stares me in the face . It seems , in short , that when , in such a case , I judge: "This surface is not , so far as I can tell , perceptibly different from the one I saw just now ," I cannot possibly be judging of the presented object "This is not , so far as I can tell , perceptibly different from that object which was presented to me just now ," for the simple reason that I can tell , as certainly , almost , as I can tell anything , that it is perceptibly different . That is the argument , as well as I can put it , for saying that this presented object , is not identical with this part of the surface of this inkstand; and that , therefore , when I judge "This is part of the surface of an inkstand ," I am not judging of this presented object , which nevertheless is the ultimate subject of my judgment , that it is part of the surface of an inkstand . And this argument does seem to me to be a very powerful one .  But nevertheless it does not seem to me to be quite conclusive , because it rests on an assumption , which , though it seems to me to have great force , does not seem to me quite certain . The assumption I mean is the assumption that , in such cases as those I have spoken of , the later presented object really is perceptibly different from the earlier . This assumption has , if I am not mistaken , seemed to many philosophers to be quite unquestionable; they have never even thought of questioning it; and I own that it used to be so with me . And I am still not sure that I may not be talking sheer nonsense in suggesting that it can be questioned . But , if I am , I am no longer able to see that I am . What now seems to me to be possible is that the sense-datum which corresponds to a tree , which I am seeing , when I am a mile off , may not really be perceived to be smaller than the one , which corresponds to the same tree , when I see it from a distance of only a hundred yards , but that it is only perceived to seem smaller; that the sense-datum which corresponds to a penny , which I am seeing obliquely , is not really perceived to be different in shape from that which corresponded to the penny , when I was straight in front of it , but is only perceived to seem different--that all that is perceived is that the one seems elliptical and the other circular; that the sense-datum presented to me when I have the blue spectacles on is not perceived to be different in colour from the one presented to me when I have not , but only to seem so; and finally that the sense-datum presented when I touch this finger is not perceived to be different in any way from that presented to me when I see it , but only to seem so that I do not perceive the one to be coloured and the other not to be so , but only that the one seems coloured and the other not . If such a view is to be possible , we shall have , of course , to maintain that the kind of experience which I have expressed by saying one seems different from the other--"seems circular ," "seems blue ," "seems coloured ," and so on--involves an ultimate , not further analysable , kind of psychological relation , not to be identified either with that involved in being "perceived" to be so and so , or with that involved in being "judged" to be so and so; since a presented object might , in this sense , seem to be elliptical , seem to be blue , etc . , when it is neither perceived to be so , nor judged to be so . But there seems to me to be no reason why there should not be such an ultimate relation . The great objection to such a view seems to me to be the difficulty of believing that I don't actually perceive this sense-datum to be red , for instance , and that other to be elliptical; that I only perceive , in many cases , that it seems so . I cannot , however , now persuade myself that it is quite clear that I do perceive it to be so . And , if I don't , then it seems really possible that this presented object really is identical with this part of the surface of this inkstand; since , when I judge , as in the cases supposed , that the surface in question is not , so far as I can tell , perceptibly different from what it was , I might really be judging of the two sense-data that they also were not , so far as I can tell , perceptibly different , the only difference between the two that is perceptible , being that the one seems to be of a certain size , shape or colour , and the other to be of a different and incompatible size , shape or colour . Of course , in those cases , as in that of the balloon being blown up , where I "perceive" that the surface has changed , e .g . in size , it would have to be admitted that I do perceive of the two sense-data not merely that they seem different in size , but that they are so . But I think it would be possible to maintain that the sense in which , in these cases , I "perceive" them to be different , is a different one from that in which , both in these and in the others , I perceive them to seem so .  Possibly in making this suggestion that sense-data , in cases where most philosophers have assumed unhesitatingly that they are perceived to be different , are only really perceived to seem different , I am , as I said , talking sheer nonsense , though I cannot , at the moment , see that I am . And possibly , even if this suggestion itself is not nonsense , even if it is true , there may be other fatal objections to the view that this presented object really is identical with this part of the surface of this inkstand . But what seems to me certain is that , unless this suggestion is true , then this presented object is certainly not identical with this part of the surface of this inkstand . And since it is doubtful whether it is not nonsense , and still more doubtful whether it is true , it must , I think , be admitted to be highly doubtful whether the two are identical . But , if they are not identical , then what I am judging with regard to this presented object , when I judge "This is an inkstand ," is certainly not that it is itself part of the surface of an inkstand; and hence , it is worth while to inquire further , what , if I am not judging this , I can be judging with regard to it .  And here , I think , the first natural suggestion to make is that just as , when I talk of "this inkstand ," what I seem really to mean is "the inkstand of which this is part of the surface ," so that the inkstand is only known to me by description as the inkstand of which this material surface is part of the surface , so again when I talk of "this material surface ," what I really mean is "the material surface to which this (presented object) has a certain relation ," so that this surface is , in its turn , only known to me by description as the surface which has a certain relation to this presented object . If that were so , then what I should be judging of this presented object , when I judge "This is part of the surface of an inkstand ," would be not that it is itself such a part , but that the thing which stands to it in a certain relation is such a part: in short , what I should be judging with regard to it , would be "There's one thing and one only which stands to this in this relation , and the thing which does so is part of the surface of an inkstand ."  But if we are to adopt the view that something of this sort is what we are judging , there occurs at once the pressing question: What on earth can the relation be with regard to which we are judging , that one and only one thing stands in it to this presented object ? And this is a question to which , so far as I know , none of those philosophers , who both hold (as many do) that this presented object is not identical with this part of the surface of this inkstand , and also that there really is something of which it could be truly predicated that it is this part of the surface of this inkstand (that is to say , who reject all views of the Mill-Russell type) , have given anything like a clear answer . It does not seem to have occurred to them that it requires an answer , chiefly , I think , because it has not occurred to them to ask what we can be judging when we make judgments of this sort . There are only two answers , that I can think of , which might be suggested with any plausibility .  Many philosophers , who take the view that the presented objects about which we make these judgments are sensations of ours , and some even who do not , are in the habit of talking of "the causes" of these objects as if we knew , in the case of each , that it had one and only one cause; and many of them seem to think that this part of the surface of this inkstand could be correctly described as the cause of this presented object . They suggest , therefore , the view that what I am judging in this case might be: "This presented object has one and only one cause , and that cause is part of the surface of an inkstand ." It seems to me quite obvious that this view , at all events , is utterly untenable . I do not believe for a moment , nor does any one , and certainly therefore do not judge , that this presented object has only one cause: I believe that it has a whole series of different causes . I do , in fact , believe that this part of the surface of this inkstand is one among the causes of my perception of this presented object: that seems to me to be a very well established scientific proposition . And I am prepared to admit that there may be good reasons for thinking that it is one among the causes of this presented object itself , though I cannot myself see that there are any . But that it is the only cause of this presented object I certainly do not believe , nor , I think , does anybody , and hence my judgment certainly cannot be "The cause of this is part of the surface of an inkstand ." It might no doubt , be possible to define some kind of causal relation , such that it might be plausibly held that it and it alone causes this presented object in that particular way . But any such definition would , so far as I can see , be necessarily very complicated . And , even when we have got it , it seems to me it would be highly improbable we could truly say that what we are judging in these cases is: "This presented object has one and only one cause , of this special kind ." Still , I do not wish to deny that some such view may possibly be true .  The only other suggestion I can make is that there may be some ultimate , not further definable relation , which we might for instance , call the relation of "being a manifestation of ," such that we might conceivably be judging: "There is one and only one thing of which this presented object is a manifestation , and that thing is part of the surface of an inkstand ." And here again , it seems to me just possible that this may be a true account of what we are judging; only I cannot find the slightest sign that I am in fact aware of any such relation .  Possibly other suggestions could be made as to what the relation is , with regard to which it could be plausibly supposed that in all cases , where we make these judgments we are in fact judging of the presented object "There is one and only one thing which stands to this object in this relation ." But it seems to me at least very doubtful whether there is any such relation at all; whether , therefore , our judgment really is of this form , and whether therefore , this part of the surface of this inkstand really is known to me by description as the thing which stands in a certain relation to this presented object . But if it isn't , and if , also , we cannot take the view that what I am judging is that this presented object itself is a part of the surface of an inkstand , there would seem to be no possible alternative but that we must take some view of what I have called the Mill-Russell type . Views of this type , if I understand them rightly , are distinguished from those which I have hitherto considered , by the fact that , according to them , there is nothing whatever in the Universe of which it could truly be predicated that it is this part of the surface of this inkstand , or indeed that it is a part of the surface of an inkstand , or an inkstand , at all . They hold , in short , that though there are plenty of material things in the Universe , there is nothing in it of which it could truly be asserted that it is a material thing: that , though , when I assert "This is an inkstand ," my assertion is true , and is such that it follows from it that there is in the Universe at least one inkstand , and , therefore , at least one material thing , yet it does not follow from it that there is anything which is a material thing . When I judge "This is an inkstand ," I am judging this presented object to possess a certain property , which is such that , if there are things , which possess that property , there are inkstands and material things , but which is such that nothing which possesses it is itself a material thing; so that in judging that there are material things , we are really always judging of some other property , which is not that of being a material thing , that there are things which possess it . It seems to me quite possible , of course , that some view of this type is the true one . Indeed , this paper may be regarded , if you like , as an argument in favour of the proposition that some such view must be true . Certainly one of my main objects in writing it was to put as plainly as I can some grave difficulties which seem to me to stand in the way of any other view; in the hope that some of those , who reject all views of the Mill-Russell type , may explain clearly which of the alternatives I have suggested they would adopt , or whether , perhaps , some other which has not occurred to me . It does not seem to me to be always sufficiently realised how difficult it is to find any answer to my question "What are we judging in these cases ?" to which there are not very grave objections , unless we adopt an answer of the Mill-Russell type . That an answer of this type is the true one , I am not myself , in spite of these objections , by any means convinced . The truth is I am completely puzzled as to what the true answer can be . At the present moment , I am rather inclined to favour the view that what I am judging of this presented object is that it is itself a part of the surface of an inkstand--that , therefore , it really is identical with this part of the surface of this inkstand , in spite of the fact that this involves the view that , where , hitherto , I have always supposed myself to be perceiving of two presented objects that they really were different , I was , in fact , only perceiving that they seemed to be different . But , as I have said , it seems to me quite possible that this view is , as I have hitherto supposed , sheer nonsense; and , in any case , there are , no doubt , other serious objections to the view that this presented object is this part of the surface of this inkstand .     THE CONCEPTION OF INTRINSIC VALUE   My main object in this paper is to try to define more precisely the most important question , which , so far as I can see , is really at issue when it is disputed with regard to any predicate of value , whether it is or is not a "subjective" predicate . There are three chief cases in which this controversy is apt to arise . It arises , first , with regard to the conceptions of "right" and "wrong ," and the closely allied conception of "duty" or "what ought to be done ." It arises , secondly , with regard to "good" and "evil ," in some sense of those words in which the conceptions for which they stand are certainly quite distinct from the conceptions of "right" and "wrong ," but in which nevertheless it is undeniable that ethics has to deal with them . And it arises , lastly , with regard to certain aesthetic conceptions , such as "beautiful" and "ugly;" or "good" and "bad ," in the sense in which these words are applied to works of art , and in which , therefore , the question what is good and bad is a question not for ethics but for aesthetics .  In all three cases there are people who maintain that the predicates in question are purely "subjective ," in a sense which can , I think , be fairly easily defined . I am not here going to attempt a perfectly accurate definition of the sense in question; but , as the term "subjective" is so desperately ambiguous , I had better try to indicate roughly the sense I am thinking of . Take the word "beautiful" for example . There is a sense of the term "subjective ," such that to say that "beautiful" stands for a subjective predicate , means , roughly , that any statement of the form "This is beautiful" merely expresses a psychological assertion to the effect that some particular individual or class of individuals either actually has , or would , under certain circumstances , have , a certain kind of mental attitude towards the thing in question . And what I mean by "having a mental attitude" towards a thing , can be best explained by saying that to desire a thing is to have one kind of mental attitude towards it , to be pleased with it is to have another , to will it is to have another; and in short that to have any kind of feeling or emotion towards it is to have a certain mental attitude towards it--a different one in each case . Thus anyone who holds that when we say that a thing is beautiful , what we mean is merely that we ourselves or some particular class of people actually do , or would under certain circumstances , have , or permanently have , a certain feeling towards the thing in question , is taking a "subjective" view of beauty .  But in all three cases there are also a good many people who hold that the predicates in question are not , in this sense "subjective"; and I think that those who hold this are apt to speak as if the view which they wish to maintain in opposition to it consisted simply and solely in holding its contradictory--in holding , that is , that the predicates in question are "objective ," where "objective" simply means the same as "not subjective ." But in fact I think this is hardly ever really the case . In the case of goodness and beauty , what such people are really anxious to maintain is by no means merely that these conceptions are "objective ," but that , besides being "objective ," they are also , in a sense which I shall try to explain , "intrinsic" kinds of value . It is this conviction--the conviction that goodness and beauty are intrinsic kinds of value , which is , I think , the strongest ground of their objection to any subjective view . And indeed , when they speak of the "objectivity" of these conceptions , what they have in mind is , I believe , always a conception which has no proper right to be called "objectivity ," since it includes as an essential part this other characteristic which I propose to call that of being an "intrinsic" kind of value .  The truth is , I believe , that though , from the proposition that a particular kind of value is "intrinsic" it does follow that it must be "objective ," the converse implication by no means holds , but on the contrary it is perfectly easy to conceive theories of e .g . "goodness ," according to which goodness would , in the strictest sense , be "objective ," and yet would not be "intrinsic ." There is , therefore , a very important difference between the conception of "objectivity ," and that which I will call "internality" but yet , if I am not mistaken , when people talk about the "objectivity" of any kind of value , they almost always confuse the two , owing to the fact that most of those who deny the "internality" of a given kind of value , also assert its "subjectivity ." How great the difference is , and that it is a fact that those who maintain the "objectivity" of goodness do , as a rule , mean by this not mere "objectivity ," but "internality ," as well , can , I think , be best brought out by considering an instance of a theory , according to which goodness would be objective but would not be intrinsic .  Let us suppose it to be held , for instance , that what is meant by saying that one type of human being A is "better" than another type B , is merely that the course of evolution tends to increase the numbers of type A and to decrease those of type B . Such a view has , in fact , been often suggested , even if it has not been held in this exact form; it amounts merely to the familiar suggestion that "better" means "better fitted to survive ." Obviously "better ," on this interpretation of its meaning , is in no sense a "subjective" conception: the conception of belonging to a type which tends to be favoured by the struggle for existence more than another is as "objective" as any conception can be . But yet , if I am not mistaken , all those who object to a subjective view of "goodness ," and insist upon its "objectivity ," would object just as strongly to this interpretation of its meaning as to any "subjective" interpretation . Obviously , therefore , what they are really anxious to contend for is not merely that goodness is "objective ," since they are here objecting to a theory which is "objective;" but something else . And this something else is , I think , certainly just that it is "intrinsic"--a character which is just as incompatible with this objective evolutionary interpretation as with any and every subjective interpretation . For if you say that to call type A "better" than type B means merely that it is more favoured in the struggle for existence , it follows that the being "better" is a predicate which does not depend merely on the intrinsic nature of A and B respectively . On the contrary , although here and now A may be more favoured than B , it is obvious that under other circumstances or with different natural laws the very same type B might be more favoured than A , so that the very same type which , under one set of circumstances , is better than B , would , under another set , be worse . Here , then , we have a case where an interpretation of "goodness ," which does make it "objective ," is incompatible with its being "intrinsic ." And it is just this same fact--the fact that , on any "subjective" interpretation , the very same kind of thing which , under some circumstances , is better than another , would , under others , be worse--which constitutes , so far as I can see , the fundamental objection to all "subjective" interpretations . Obviously , therefore , to express this objection by saying that goodness is "objective" is very incorrect; since goodness might quite well be "objective" and yet not possess the very characteristic which it is mainly wished to assert that it has .  In the case , therefore , of ethical and aesthetic "goodness ," I think that what those who contend for the "objectivity" of these conceptions really wish to contend for is not mere "objectivity" at all , but principally and essentially that they are intrinsic kinds of value . But in the case of "right" and "wrong" and "duty ," the same cannot be said , because many of those who object to the view that these conceptions are "subjective ," nevertheless do not hold that they are "intrinsic ." We cannot , therefore , say that what those who contend for the "objectivity" of right and wrong really mean is always chiefly that those conceptions are intrinsic , but we can , I think , say that what they do mean is certainly not "objectivity" in this case any more than the other; since here , just as there , it would be possible to find certain views , which are in every sense "objective ," to which they would object just as strongly as to any subjective view . And though what is meant by "objectivity" in this case , is not that "right" and "wrong" are themselves "intrinsic ," what is , I think , meant here too is that they have a fixed relation to a kind of value which is "intrinsic ." It is this fixed relation to an intrinsic kind of value , so far as I can see , which gives to right and wrong that kind and degree of fixity and impartiality which they actually are felt to possess , and which is what people are thinking of when they talk of their "objectivity ." Here , too , therefore , to talk of the characteristic meant as "objectivity" is just as great a misnomer as in the other cases; since though it is a characteristic which is incompatible with any kind of "subjectivity ," it is also incompatible , for the same reason , with many kinds of "objectivity ."  For these reasons I think that what those who contend for the "objectivity" of certain kinds of value , or for the "objectivity" of judgments of value , commonly have in mind is not really "objectivity" at all , but either that the kinds of value in question are themselves "intrinsic ," or else that they have a fixed relation to some kind that is so . The conception upon which they really wish to lay stress is not that of "objective value ," but that of "intrinsic value ," though they confuse the two . And I think this is the case to a considerable extent not only with the defenders of so-called "objectivity ," but also with its opponents . Many of those who hold strongly (as many do) that all kinds of value are "subjective" certainly object to the so-called "objective" view , not so much because it is objective , as because it is not naturalistic ox positivistic--a characteristic which does naturally follow from the contention that value is "intrinsic ," but does not follow from the mere contention that it is "objective ." To a view which is at the same time both "naturalistic" or "positivistic" and also "objective ," such as the Evolutionary view which I sketched just now , they do not feel at all the same kind or degree of objection as to any so-called "objective" view . With regard to so-called "objective" views they are apt to feel not only that they are false , but that they involve a particularly poisonous kind of falsehood--the erecting into a "metaphysical" entity of what is really susceptible of a simple naturalistic explanation . They feel that to hold such a view is not merely to make a mistake , but to make a superstitious mistake . They feel the same kind of contempt for those who hold it , which we are apt to feel towards those whom we regard as grossly superstitious , and which is felt by certain persons for what they call "metaphysics ." Obviously , therefore , what they really object to is not simply the view that these predicates are "objective ," but something else--something which does not at all follow from the contention that they are "objective ," but which does follow from the contention that they are "intrinsic ."  In disputes , therefore , as to whether particular kinds of value are or are not "subjective ," I think that the issue which is really felt to be important , almost always by one side , and often by both , is not really the issue between "subjective" and "non-subjective ," but between "intrinsic" and "non-intrinsic ." And not only is this felt to be the more important issue; I think it really is so . For the difference that must be made to our view of the Universe , according as we hold that some kinds of value are "intrinsic" or that none are , is much greater than any which follows from a mere difference of opinion as to whether some are "non-subjective ," or all without exception "subjective ." To hold that any kinds of value are "intrinsic" entails the recognition of a kind of predicate extremely different from any we should otherwise have to recognise and perhaps unique; whereas it is in any case certain that there are "objective" predicates as well as "subjective ."  But now what is this "internality" of which I have been speaking ? What is meant by saying with regard to a kind of value that it is "intrinsic ?" To express roughly what is meant is , I think , simple enough; and everybody will recognise it at once , as a notion which is constantly in people's heads; but I want to dwell upon it at some length , because I know of no place where it is expressly explained and defined , and because , though it seems very simple and fundamental , the task of defining it precisely is by no moans easy and involves some difficulties which I must confess that I do not know how to solve .  I have already given incidentally the main idea in speaking of that evolutionary interpretation of "goodness ," according to which , as I said , goodness would be "objective" but would not be "intrinsic ." I there used as equivalent to the assertion that 'better ,' on that definition , would not be 'intrinsic ,' the assertion that the question whether one type of being A was better than another B would not depend solely on the intrinsic natures of A and B , but on circumstances and the laws of nature . And I think that this phrase will in fact suggest to everybody just what I do mean by "intrinsic" value . We can , in fact , set up the following definition . To say that a kind of value is "intrinsic" means merely that the question whether a thing possesses it , and in what degree it possesses it , depends solely on the intrinsic nature of the thing in question .  But though this definition does , I think , convey exactly what I mean , I want to dwell upon its meaning , partly because the conception of 'differing in intrinsic nature which I believe to be of fundamental importance , is liable to be confused with other conceptions , and partly because the definition involves notions , which I do not know how to define exactly .  When I say , with regard to any particular kind of value , that the question whether and in what degree anything possesses it depends solely on the intrinsic nature of the thing in question , I mean to say two different things at the same time . I mean to say (1) that it is impossible for what is strictly one and the same thing to possess that kind of value at one time , or in one set of circumstances , and not to possess it at another; and equally impossible for it to possess it in one degree at one time , or in one set of circumstances , and to possess it in a different degree at another , or in a different set . This , I think , is obviously part of what is naturally conveyed by saying that the question whether and in what degree a thing possesses the kind of value in question always depends solely on the intrinsic nature of the thing . For if x and y have different intrinsic natures , it follows that x cannot be quite strictly one and the same thing as y; and hence if x and y can have a different intrinsic value , only where their intrinsic natures are different , it follows that one and the same thing must always have the same intrinsic value . This , then , is part of what is meant; and about this part I think I need say no more , except to call attention to the fact that it involves a conception , which as we shall see is also involved in the other part , and which involves the same difficulty in both cases--I mean , the conception which is expressed by the word 'impossible .' (2) The second part of what is meant is that if a given thing possesses any kind of intrinsic value in a certain degree , then not only must that same thing possess it , under all circumstances , in the same degree , but also anything exactly like it , must , under all circumstances , possess it in exactly the same degree . Or to put it in the corresponding negative form: It is impossible that of two exactly similar things one should possess it and the other not , or that one should possess it in one degree , and the other in a different one .  I think this second proposition also is naturally conveyed by saying that the kind of value in question depends solely on the intrinsic nature of what possesses it . For we should naturally say of two things which were exactly alike intrinsically , in spite of their being two , that they possessed the same intrinsic nature . But it is important to call attention expressly to the fact that what I mean by the expression 'having a different intrinsic nature' is equivalent to 'not exactly alike' because here there is real risk of confusion between this conception and a different one . This comes about as follows . It is natural to suppose that the phrase 'having a different intrinsic nature' is equivalent to the phrase 'intrinsically different' or 'having different intrinsic properties .' But , if we do make this identification , there is a risk of confusion . For it is obvious that there is a sense in which , when things are exactly like , they must be 'intrinsically different' and have different intrinsic properties , merely because they are two . For instance , two patches of colour may be exactly alike , in spite of the fact that each possesses a constituent which the other does not possess , provided only that their two constituents are exactly alike . And yet , in a certain sense , it is obvious that the fact that each has a constituent , which the other has not got , does constitute an intrinsic difference between them , and implies that each has an intrinsic property which the other has not got . And even where the two things are simple the mere fact that they are numerically different does in a sense constitute an intrinsic difference between them , and each will have at least one intrinsic property which the other has not got--namely that of being identical with itself . It is obvious therefore that the phrases 'intrinsically different' and 'having different intrinsic properties' are ambiguous . They may be used in such a sense that to say of two things that they are intrinsically different or have different intrinsic properties does not imply that they are not exactly alike , but only that they are numerically different . Or they may be used in a sense in which two things can be said to be intrinsically different , and to have different intrinsic properties only when they are not exactly alike . It is , therefore , extremely important to insist that when I say: Two things can differ in intrinsic value , only when they have different intrinsic natures , I am using the expression 'having different intrinsic natures' in the latter sense and not the former:--in a sense in which the mere fact that two things are two , or differ numerically , does not imply that they have different intrinsic natures , but in which they can be said to have different intrinsic natures , only where , besides differing numerically , they are also not exactly alike .  But as soon as this is explained , another risk of confusion arises owing to the fact that when people contrast mere numerical difference with a kind of intrinsic difference , which is not merely numerical , they are apt to identify the latter with qualitative difference . It might , therefore , easily be thought that by 'difference in intrinsic nature' I mean 'difference in quality .' But this identification of difference in quality with difference in intrinsic nature would also be a mistake . It is true that what is commonly meant by difference of quality , in the strict sense , always is a difference of intrinsic nature: two things cannot differ in quality without differing in intrinsic nature; and that fact is one of the most important facts about qualitative difference . But the converse is by no means also true: although two things cannot differ in quality without differing in intrinsic nature , they can differ in intrinsic nature without differing in quality; or , in other words , difference in quality is only one species of difference in intrinsic nature . That this is so follows from the fact that , as I explained , I am using the phrase 'different in intrinsic nature' as equivalent to 'not exactly like for it is quite plain that two things may not be exactly alike , in spite of the fact that they don't differ in quality , e .g . if the only difference between them were in respect of the degree in which they possess some quality they do possess . Nobody would say that a very loud sound was exactly like a very soft one , even if they were exactly like in quality; and yet it is plain there is a sense in which their intrinsic nature is different For this reason alone qualitative difference cannot be identified with difference in intrinsic nature . And there are still other reasons . Difference in size , for instance may be a difference in intrinsic nature , in the sense I mean , but it can hardly be called a difference in quality . Or take such a difference as the difference between two patterns consisting in the fact that the one is a yellow circle with a red spot in the middle , and the other a yellow circle with a blue spot in the middle . This difference would perhaps be loosely called a difference of quality; but obviously it would be more accurate to call it a difference which consists in the fact that the one pattern has a constituent which is qualitatively different from any which the other has; and the difference between being qualitatively different and having qualitatively different constituents is important both because the latter can only be defined in terms of the former , and because it is possible for simple things to differ from one another in the former way , whereas it is only possible for complex things to differ in the latter .  I hope this is sufficient to make clear exactly what the conception is which I am expressing by the phrase "different in intrinsic nature ." The important points are (1) that it is a kind of difference which does not hold between two things , when they are merely numerically different , but only when , besides being numerically different , they are also not exactly alike and (2) that it is not identical with qualitative difference; although qualitative difference is one particular species of it . The conception seems to me to be an extremely important and fundamental one , although , so far as I can see , it has no quite simple and unambiguous name: and this is the reason why I have dwelt on it at such length . "Not exactly like" is the least ambiguous way of expressing it; but this has the disadvantage that it looks as if the idea of exact likeness were the fundamental one from which this was derived , whereas I believe the contrary to be the case . For this reason it is perhaps better to stick to the cumbrous phrase "different in intrinsic nature ."  So much for the question what is meant by saying of two things that they "differ in intrinsic nature ." We have now to turn to the more difficult question as to what is meant by the words "impossible" and "necessary" in the statement: A kind of value is intrinsic if and only if , it is impossible that x and y should have different values of the kind , unless they differ in intrinsic nature; and in the equivalent statement: A kind of value is intrinsic if and only if , when anything possesses it , that same thing or anything exactly like it would necessarily or must always , under all circumstances , possess it in exactly the same degree .  As regards the meaning of this necessity and impossibility , we may begin by making two points clear .  (1) It is sometimes contended , and with some plausibility , that what we mean by saying that it is possible for a thing which possesses one predicate F to possess another G , is , sometimes at least , merely that some things which possess F do in fact also possess G . And if we give this meaning to "possible ," the corresponding meaning of the statement it is impossible for a thing which possesses F to possess G will be merely: Things which possess F never do in fact possess G . If , then , we understood "impossible" in this sense , the condition for the "internality" of a kind of value , which I have stated by saying that if a kind of value is to be "intrinsic" it must be impossible for two things to possess it in different degrees , if they are exactly like one another , will amount merely to saying that no two things which are exactly like one another ever do , in fact , possess it in different degrees . It follows , that , if this were all that were meant , this condition would be satisfied , if only it were true (as for all I know it may be) that , in the case of all things which possess any particular kind of intrinsic value , there happens to be nothing else in the Universe exactly like any one of them; for if this were so , it would , of course , follow that no two things which are exactly alike did in fact possess the kind of value in question in different degrees , for the simple reason that everything which possessed it at all would be unique in the sense that there was nothing else exactly like it . If this were all that were meant , therefore , we could prove any particular kind of value to satisfy this condition , by merely proving that there never has in fact and never will be anything exactly like any one of the things which possess it: and our assertion that it satisfied this condition would merely be an empirical generalisation . Moreover if this were all that was meant it would obviously be by no means certain that purely subjective predicates could not satisfy the condition in question; since it would be satisfied by any subjective predicate of which it happened to be true that everything which possessed it was , in fact , unique--that there was nothing exactly like it; and for all I know there may be many subjective predicates of which this is true . It is , therefore , scarcely necessary to say that I am not using "impossible" in this sense . When I say that a kind of value , to be intrinsic , must satisfy the condition that it must be impossible for two things exactly alike to possess it in different degrees , I do not mean by this condition anything which a kind of value could be proved to satisfy , by the mere empirical fact that there was nothing else exactly like any of the things which possessed it . It is , of course , an essential part of my meaning that we must be able to say not merely that no two exactly similar things do in fact possess it in different degrees , but that , if there had been or were going to be anything exactly similar to a thing which does possess it , even though , in fact , there has not and won't be any such thing , that thing would have possessed or would possess the kind of value in question in exactly the same degree . It is essential to this meaning of "impossibility" that it should entitle us to assert what would have been the case , under conditions which never have been and never will be realised; and it seems obvious that no mere empirical generalisation can entitle us to do this .  But (2) to say that I am not using 'necessity' in this first sense , is by no means sufficient to explain what I do mean . For it certainly seems as if causal laws (though this is disputed) do entitle us to make assertions of the very kind that mere empirical generalisations do not entitle us to make . In virtue of a causal law we do seem to be entitled to assert such things as that , if a given thing had had a property or were to have a property F which it didn't have or won't have , it would have had or would have some other property G . And it might , therefore , be thought that the kind of 'necessity' and 'impossibility' I am talking of is this kind of causal 'necessity' and 'impossibility .' It is , therefore , important to insist that I do not mean this kind either . If this were all I meant , it would again be by no means obvious , that purely subjective predicates might not satisfy our second condition . It may , for instance , for all I know , be true that there are causal laws which insure that in the case of everything that is 'beautiful ,' anything exactly like any of these things would , in this Universe , excite a particular kind of feeling in everybody to whom it were presented in a particular way: and if that were so , we should have a subjective predicate which satisfied the condition that , when a given thing possesses that predicate , it is impossible (in the causal sense) that any exactly similar thing should not also possess it . The kind of necessity I am talking of is not , therefore , mere causal necessity either . When I say that if a given thing possesses a certain degree of intrinsic value , anything precisely similar to it would necessarily have possessed that value in exactly the same degree , I mean that it would have done so , even if it had existed in a Universe in which the causal laws were quite different from what they are in this one . I mean , in short , that it is impossible for any precisely similar thing to possess a different value , in precisely such a sense as that , in which it is , I think , generally admitted that it is not impossible that causal laws should have been different from what they are--a sense of impossibility , therefore , which certainly does not depend merely on causal laws .  That there is such a sense of necessity--a sense which entitles us to say that what has F would have G , even if causal laws were quite different from what they are--is , I think , quite clear from such instances as the following . Suppose you take a particular patch of colour , which is yellow . We can , I think , say with certainty that any patch exactly like that one , would be yellow , even if it existed in a Universe in which causal laws were quite different from what they are in this one . We can say that any such patch must be yellow , quite unconditionally , whatever the circumstances , and whatever the causal laws . And it is in a sense similar to this , in respect of the fact that it is neither empirical nor causal , that I mean the 'must' to be understood , when I say that if a kind of value is to be 'intrinsic ,' then , supposing a given-thing possesses it in a certain degree , anything exactly like that thing must possess it in exactly the same degree . To say , of 'beauty' or 'goodness' that they are 'intrinsic' is only , therefore , to say that this thing which is obviously true of 'yellowness' and 'blueness' and 'redness' is true of them . And if we give this sense to 'must' in our definition , then I think it is obvious that to say of a given kind of value that it is intrinsic is inconsistent with its being 'subjective .' For there is , I think , pretty clearly no subjective predicate of which we can say thus unconditionally , that , if a given thing possesses it , then anything exactly like that thing , would , under any circumstances , and under any causal laws , also possess it . For instance , whatever kind of feeling you take , it is plainly not true that supposing I have that feeling towards a given thing A , then I should necessarily under any circumstances have that feeling towards anything precisely similar to A: for the simple reason that a thing precisely similar to A might exist in a Universe in which I did not exist at all . And similarly it is not true of any feeling whatever , that if somebody has that feeling towards a given thing A , then , in arty Universe , in which a thing precisely similar to A existed , somebody would have that feeling towards it . Nor finally is it even true , that if it is true of a given thing A , that , under actual causal laws , any one to whom A were presented in a certain way would have a certain feeling towards it , then the same hypothetical predicate would , in any Universe , belong to anything precisely similar to A: in every case it seems to be possible that there might be a Universe , in which the causal laws were such that the proposition would not be true .  It is , then , because in my definition of 'intrinsic' value the 'must' is to be understood in this unconditional sense , that I think that the proposition that a kind of value is 'intrinsic' is inconsistent with its being subjective . But it should be observed that in holding that there is this inconsistency , I am contradicting a doctrine which seems to be held by many philosophers . There are , as you probably know , some philosophers who insist strongly on a doctrine which they express by saying that no relations are purely external . And so far as I can make out one thing which they mean by this is just that , whenever r has any relation whatever which y has not got , x and y cannot be exactly alike: That any difference in relation necessarily entails a difference in intrinsic nature . There is , I think , no doubt that when these philosophers say this , they mean by their 'cannot' and 'necessarily' an unconditional 'cannot' and 'must .' And hence it follows they are holding that , if , for instance , a thing A pleases me now , then any other thing , B , precisely similar to A , must , under any circumstances , and in any Universe , please me also: since , if B did not please me , it would not possess a relation which A does possess , and therefore , by their principle , could not be precisely similar to A--must differ from it in intrinsic nature . But it seems to me to be obvious that this principle is false . If it were true , it would follow that I can know a priori such things as that no patch of colour which is seen by you and is not seen by me is ever exactly like any patch which is seen by me and is not seen by you; or that no patch of colour which is surrounded by a red ring is ever exactly like one which is not so surrounded . But it is surely obvious , that , whether these things are true or not they are things which I cannot know a priori . It is simply not evident a priori that no patch of colour which is seen by A and not by B is ever exactly like one which is seen by B and not by A , and that no patch of colour which is surrounded by a red ring is ever exactly like one which is not . And this illustration serves to bring out very well both what is meant by saying of such a predicate as 'beautiful 'that it is intrinsic ,' and why , if it is , it cannot be subjective . What is meant is just that if A is beautiful and B is not , you could know a priori that A and B are not exactly alike; whereas , with any such subjective predicate , as that of exciting a particular feeling in me , or that of being a thing which would excite such a feeling in any spectator , you cannot tell a priori that a thing A which did possess such a predicate and a thing B which did not , could not be exactly alike .  It seems to me , therefore , quite certain , in spite of the dogma that no relations are purely external , that there are many predicates , such for instance as most (if not all) subjective predicates or the objective one of being surrounded by a red ring , which do not depend solely on the intrinsic nature of what possesses them: or , in other words , of which it is not true that if x possesses them and y does not , x and y must differ in intrinsic nature . But what precisely is meant by this unconditional 'must ,' I must confess I don't know . The obvious thing to suggest is that it is the logical 'must ,' which certainly is unconditional in just this sense: the kind of necessity , which we assert to hold , for instance , when we say that whatever is a right-angled triangle must be a triangle , or that whatever is yellow must be either yellow or blue . But I must say I cannot see that all unconditional necessity is of this nature . I do not see how it can be deduced from any logical law that , if a given patch of colour be yellow , then any patch which were exactly like the first would be yellow too . And similarly in our case of 'intrinsic' value , though I think it is true that beauty , for instance , is 'intrinsic ,' I do not see how it can be deduced from any logical law , that if A is beautiful , anything that were exactly like A would be beautiful too , in exactly the same degree .  Moreover , though I do believe that both "yellow" (in the sense in which it applies to sense-data) and "beautiful" are predicates which , in this unconditional sense , depend only on the intrinsic nature of what possesses them , there seems to me to be an extremely important difference between them which constitutes a further difficulty in the way of getting quite clear as to what this unconditional sense of "must" is . The difference I mean is one which I am inclined to express by saying that though both yellowness and beauty are predicates which depend only on the intrinsic nature of what possesses them , yet while yellowness is itself an intrinsic predicate , beauty is not . Indeed it seems to me to be one of the most important truths about predicates of value , that though many of them are intrinsic kinds of value , in the sense I have defined , yet none of them are intrinsic properties , in the sense in which such properties as "yellow" or the property of "being a state of pleasure" or "being a state of things which contains a balance of pleasure" are intrinsic properties . It is obvious , for instance , that , if we are to reject all naturalistic theories of value , we must not only reject those theories , according to which no kind of value would be intrinsic , but must also reject such theories as those which assert , for instance , that to say that a state of mind is good is to say that it is a state of being pleased; or that to say that a state of things is good is to say that it contains a balance of pleasure over pain . There are , in short , two entirely different types of naturalistic theory , the difference between which may be illustrated by the difference between the assertion , "A is good" means "A is pleasant" and the assertion "A is good" means "A is a state of pleasure ." Theories of the former type imply that goodness is not an intrinsic kind of value , whereas theories of the latter type imply equally emphatically that it is: since obviously such predicates as that "of being a state of pleasure ," or "containing a balance of pleasure ," are predicates like "yellow" in respect of the fact that if a given thing possesses them , anything exactly like the thing in question must possess them . It seems to me equally obvious that both types of theory are false: but I do not know how to exclude them both except by saying that two different propositions are both true of goodness , namely: (1) that it does depend only on the intrinsic nature of what possesses it--which excludes theories of the first type and (2) that , though this is so , it is yet not itself an intrinsic property--which excludes those of the second . It was for this reason that I said above that , if there are any intrinsic kinds of value , they would constitute a class of predicates which is , perhaps , unique; for I cannot think of any other predicate which resembles them in respect of the fact , that though not itself intrinsic , it yet shares with intrinsic properties the characteristics of depending solely on the intrinsic nature of what possesses it . So far as I know , certain predicates of value are the only non-intrinsic properties which share with intrinsic properties this characteristic of depending only on the intrinsic nature of what possesses them .  If , however , we are thus to say that predicates of value , though dependent solely on intrinsic properties , are not themselves intrinsic properties , there must be some characteristic belonging to intrinsic properties which predicates of value never possess . And it seems to me quite obvious that there is; only I can't see what it is . It seems to me quite obvious that if you assert of a given state of things that it contains a balance of pleasure over pain , you are asserting of it not only a different predicate , from what you would be asserting of it if you said it was "good"--but a predicate which is of quite a different kind; and in the same way that when you assert of a patch of colour that it is "yellow ," the predicate you assert is not only different from "beautiful ," but of quite a different kind , in the same way as before . And of course the mere fact that many people have thought that goodness and beauty were subjective is evidence that there is some great difference of kind between them and such predicates as being yellow or containing a balance of pleasure . But what the difference is , if we suppose , as I suppose , that goodness and beauty are not subjective , and that they do share with "yellowness" and "containing pleasure ," the property of depending solely on the intrinsic nature of what possesses them , I confess I cannot say . I can only vaguely express the kind of difference I feel there to be by saying that intrinsic properties seem to describe the intrinsic nature of what possesses them in a sense in which predicates of value never do . If you could enumerate all the intrinsic properties a given thing possessed , you would have given a complete description of it , and would not need to mention any predicates of value it possessed; whereas no description of a given thing could be complete which omitted any intrinsic property . But , in any case , owing to the fact that predicates of intrinsic value are not themselves intrinsic properties , you cannot define "intrinsic property ," in the way which at first sight seems obviously the right one . You cannot say that an intrinsic property is a property such that , if one thing possesses it and another does not , the intrinsic nature of the two things must be different . For this is the very thing which we are maintaining to be true of predicates of intrinsic value , while at the same time we say that they are not intrinsic properties . Such a definition of "intrinsic property" would therefore only be possible if , we could say that the necessity there is that , if x and y possess different intrinsic properties , their nature must be different , is a necessity of a different kind from the necessity there is that , if x and y are of different intrinsic values , their nature must be different , although both necessities are unconditional . And it seems to me possible that this is the true explanation . But , if so , it obviously adds to the difficulty of explaining the meaning of the unconditional "must ," since , in this case , there would be two different meanings of "must ," both unconditional , and yet neither , apparently , identical with the logical "must ."     EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL RELATIONS   [Propositions and terms surrounded by "°" are "over-ligned" in original .]  In the index to Appearance and Reality (First Edition) Mr . Bradley declares that all relations are "intrinsical"; and the following are some of the phrases by means of which he tries to explain what he means by this assertion . "A relation must at both ends affect , and pass into , the being of its terms" (p . 364) . "Every relation essentially penetrates the being of its terms , and is , in this sense , intrinsical" (p . 392) . "To stand in a relation and not to be relative , to support it and yet not to be infected and undermined by it , seems out of the question" (p . 142) . And a good many other philosophers seem inclined to take the same view about relations which Mr . Bradley is here trying to express . Other phrases which seem to be sometimes used to express it , or a part of it , are these: "No relations are purely external"; "All relations qualify or modify or make a difference to the terms between which they hold"; "No terms are independent of any of the relations in which they stand to other terms ." (See e .g . , Joachim , The Nature of Truth , pp . 11 , 12 , 46) .  It is , I think , by no means easy to make out exactly what these philosophers mean by these assertions . And the main object of this paper is to try to define clearly one proposition , which , even if it does not give the whole of what they mean , seems to me to be always implied by what they mean , and to be certainly false . I shall try to make clear the exact meaning of this proposition , to point out some of its most important consequences , and to distinguish it clearly from certain other propositions which are , I think , more or less liable to be confused with it . And I shall maintain that , if we give to the assertion that a relation is "internal" the meaning which this proposition would give to it , then , though , in that sense , some relations are "internal ," others , no less certainly , are not , but are "purely external ."  To begin with , we may , I think , clear the ground , by putting on one side two propositions about relations , which , though they seem sometimes to be confused with the view we are discussing , do , I think , quite certainly not give the whole meaning of that view .  The first is a proposition which is quite certainly and obviously true of all relations , without exception , and which , though it raises points of great difficulty , can , I think , be clearly enough stated for its truth to be obvious . It is the proposition that , in the case of any relation whatever , the kind of fact which we express by saying that a given term A has that relation to another term B , or to a pair of terms B and C , or to three terms B , C , and D , and so on , in no case simply consists in the terms in question together with the relation . Thus the fact which we express by saying that Edward VII was father of George V , obviously does not simply consist in Edward , George , and the relation of fatherhood . In order that the fact may be , it is obviously not sufficient that there should merely be George and Edward and the relation of fatherhood; it is further necessary that the relation should relate Edward to George , and not only so , but also that it should relate them in the particular way which we express by saying that Edward was father of George , and not merely in the way which we should express by saying that George was father of Edward . This proposition is , I think , obviously true of all relations without exception: and the only reason why I have mentioned it is because , in an article in which Mr . Bradley criticises Mr . Russell (Mind , 1910 , p . 179) , he seems to suggest that it is inconsistent with the proposition that any relations are merely external , and because , so far as I can make out , some other people who maintain that all relations are internal seem sometimes to think that their contention follows from this proposition . The way in which Mr . Bradley puts it is that such facts are unities which are not completely analysable; and this is , of course , true , if it means merely that in the case of no such fact is there any set of constituents of which we can truly say: This fact is identical with these constituents . But whether from this it follows that all relations are internal must of course depend upon what is meant by the latter statement . If it be merely used to express this proposition itself , or anything which follows from it , then , of course , there can be no doubt that all relations are internal . But I think there is no doubt that those who say this do not mean by their words merely this obvious proposition itself; and I am going to point out something which I think they always imply , and which certainly does not follow from it .  The second proposition which , I think , may be put aside at once as certainly not giving the whole of what is meant , is the proposition which is , I think , the natural meaning of the phrases "All relations modify or affect their terms" or "All relations make a difference to their terms ." There is one perfectly natural and intelligible sense in which a given relation may be said to modify a term which stands in that relation , namely , the sense in which we should say that , if , by putting a stick of sealing-wax into a flame , we make the sealing-wax melt , its relationship to the flame has modified the sealing-wax . This is a sense of the word "modify" in which part of what is meant by saying of any term that it is modified , is that it has actually undergone a change: and I think it is clear that a sense in which this is part of its meaning is the only one in which the word "modify" can properly be used . If , however , those who say that all relations modify their terms were using the word in this , its proper , sense , part of what would be meant by this assertion would be that all terms which have relations at all actually undergo changes . Such an assertion would be obviously false , for the simple reason that there are terms which have relation ? and which yet never change at all . And I think it is quite clear that those who assert that all relations are internal , in the sense we are concerned with , mean by this something which could be consistently asserted to be true of all relations without exception , even if it were admitted that some terms which have relations do not change . When , therefore , they use the phrase that all relations "modify" their terms as equivalent to "all relations are internal ," they must be using "modify" in some metaphorical sense other than its natural one . I think , indeed , that most of them would be inclined to assert that in every case in which a term A comes to have to another term B a relation , which it did not have to B in some immediately preceding interval , its having of that relation to that term causes it to undergo some change , which it would not have undergone if it had not stood in precisely that relation to B and I think perhaps they would think that this proposition follows from some proposition which is true of all relations , without exception , and which is what they mean by saying that all relations are internal . The question whether the coming into a new relation does thus always cause some modification in the term which comes into it is one which is often discussed , as if it had something to do with the question whether all relations are internal as when , for instance , it is discussed whether knowledge of a thing alters the thing known . And for my part I should maintain that this proposition is certainly not true . But what I am concerned with now is not the question whether it is true , but simply to point out that , so far as I can see , it can have nothing to do with the question whether all relations are internal , for the simple reason that it cannot possibly follow from any proposition with regard to all relations without exception . It asserts with regard to all relational properties of a certain kind , that they have a certain kind of effect; and no proposition of this sort can , I think follow from any universal proposition with regard to all relations .  We have , therefore , rejected as certainly not giving the whole meaning of the dogma that all relations are internal: (1) the obviously true proposition that no relational facts are completely analysable , in the precise sense which I gave to that assertion; and (2) the obviously false proposition that all relations modify their terms , in the natural sense of the term "modify ," in which it always has as part of its meaning "cause to undergo a change ." And we have also seen that this false proposition that any relation which a term comes to have always causes it to undergo a change is wholly irrelevant to the question whether all relations are internal or not . We have seen finally that if the assertion that all relations modify their terms is to be understood as equivalent to the assertion that all are internal , "modify" must be understood in some metaphorical sense . The question is: What is this metaphorical sense ?  And one point is , I think , pretty clear to begin with . It is obvious that , in the case of some relations , a given term A may have the relation in question , not only to one other term , but to several different terms . If , for instance , we consider the relation of fatherhood , it is obvious that a man may be father , not only of one , but of several different children . And those who say that all relations modify their terms always mean , I think , not merely that every different relation which a term has modifies it; but also that , where the relation is one which the term has to several different other terms , then , in the case of each of these terms , it is modified by the fact that it has the relation in question to that particular term . If , for instance , A is father of three children , B , C , and D , they mean to assert that he is modified , not merely by being a father , but by being the father of B , also by being the father of C , and also by being the father of D . The mere assertion that all relations modify their terms does not , of course , make it quite clear that this is what is meant; but I think there is no doubt that it is always meant; and I think we can express it more clearly by using a term , which I have already introduced , and saying the doctrine is that all relational properties modify their terms , in a sense which remains to be defined . I think there is no difficulty in understanding what I mean by a relational property . If A is father of B , then what you assert of A when you say that he is so is a relational property--namely the property of being father of B; and it is quite clear that this property is not itself a relation , in the same fundamental sense in which the relation of fatherhood is so; and also that , if C is a different child from B , then the property of being father of C is a different relational property from that of being father of B , although there is only one relation , that of fatherhood , from which both are derived . So far as I can make out , those philosophers who talk of all relations being internal , often actually mean by "relations" "relational properties"; when they talk of all the "relations" of a given term , they mean all its relational properties , and not merely all the different relations , of each of which it is true that the term has that relation to something . It will , I think , conduce to clearness to use a different word for these two entirely different uses of the term "relation" to call "fatherhood" a relation , and "fatherhood of B" a "relational property ." And the fundamental proposition , which is meant by the assertion that all relations are internal , is , I think , a proposition with regard to relational properties , and not with regard to relations properly so-called . There is no doubt that those who maintain this dogma mean to maintain that all relational properties are related in a peculiar way to the terms which possess them--that they modify or are internal to them , in some metaphorical sense . And once we have defined what this sense is in which a relational property can be said to be internal to a term which possesses it , we can easily derive from it a corresponding sense in which the relations , strictly so called , from which relational properties are derived , can be said to be internal .  Our question is then: What is the metaphorical sense of "modify" in which the proposition that all relations are internal is equivalent to the proposition that all relational properties "modify" the terms which possess them ? I think it is clear that the term "modify" would never have been used at all to express the relation meant , unless there had been some analogy between this relation and that which we have seen is the proper sense of "modify ," namely , causes to change . And I think we can see where the analogy comes in by considering the statement , with regard to any particular term A and any relational property P which belongs to it , that A would have been different from what it is if it had not had P: the statement , for instance , that Edward VII would have been different if he had not been father of George V . This is a thing which we can obviously truly say of A and P , in some sense , whenever it is true of P that it modified A in the proper sense of the word: if the being held in the flame causes the sealing-wax to melt , we can truly say (in some sense) that the sealing-wax would not have been in a melted state if it had not been in the flame . But it seems as if it were a thing which might also be true of A and P , where it is not true that the possession of P caused A to change; since the mere assertion that A would have been different , if it had not had P , does not necessarily imply that the possession of P caused A to have any property which it would not have had otherwise . And those who say that all relations are internal do sometimes tend to speak as if what they meant could be put in the form: In the case of every relational property which a thing has , it is always true that the thing which has it would have been different if it had not had that property; they sometimes say even: If P be a relational property and A a term which has it , then it is always true that A would not have been A if it had not had P . This is , I think , obviously a clumsy way of expressing anything which could possibly be true , since , taken strictly , it implies the self-contradictory proposition that if A had not had P , it would not have been true that A did not have P . But it is nevertheless a more or less natural way of expressing a proposition which might quite well be true , namely , that , supposing A has P , then anything which had not had P would necessarily have been different from A . This is the proposition which I wish to suggest as giving the metaphorical meaning of "P modifies A ," of which we are in search . It is a proposition to which I think a perfectly precise meaning can be given , and one which does not at all imply that the possession of P caused any change in A , but which might conceivably be true of all terms and all the relational properties they have , without exception . And it seems to me that it is not unnatural that the proposition that this is true of P and A , should have been expressed in the form , "P modifies A ," since it can be more or less naturally expressed in the perverted form , "If A had not had P it would have been different ,"--a form of words , which , as we saw , can also be used whenever P does , in the proper sense , modify A .  I want to suggest , then , that one thing which is always implied by the dogma that , "All relations are internal ," is that , in the case of every relational property , it can always be truly asserted of any term A which has that property , that any term which had not had it would necessarily have been different from A .  This is the proposition to which I want to direct attention . And there are two phrases in it , which require some further explanation .  The first is the phrase "would necessarily have been ." And the meaning of this can be explained , in a preliminary way , as follows:--To say of a pair of properties P and Q , that any term which had had P would necessarily have had Q , is equivalent to saying that , in every case , from the proposition with regard to any given term that it has P , it follows that that term has Q: follows being understood in the sense in which from the proposition with regard to any term , that it is a right angle , it follows that it is an angle , and in which from the proposition with regard to any term that it is red it follows that it is coloured . There is obviously some very important sense in which from the proposition that a thing is a right angle , it does follow that it is an angle , and from the proposition that a thing is red it does follow that it is coloured . And what I am maintaining is that the metaphorical sense of "modify ," in which it is maintained that all relational properties modify the subjects which possess them , can be defined by reference to this sense of "follows ." The definition is: To say of a given relational property P that it modifies or is internal to a given term A which possesses it , is to say that from the proposition that a thing has not got P it follows that that thing is different from A . In other words , it is to say that the property of not possessing P , and the property of being different from A are related to one another in the peculiar way in which the property of being a right-angled triangle is related to that of being a triangle , or that of being red to that of being coloured .  To complete the definition it is necessary , however , to define the sense in which "different from A" is to be understood . There are two different senses which the statement that A is different from B may bear . It may be meant merely that A is numerically different from B , other than B , not identical with B . Or it may be meant that not only is this the case , but also that A is related to B in a way which can be roughly expressed by saying that A is qualitatively different from B . And of these two meanings , those who say "All relations make a difference to their terms ," always , I think , mean difference in the latter sense and not merely in the former . That is to say , they mean , that if P be a relational property which belongs to A , then the absence of P entails not only numerical difference from A , but qualitative difference . But , in fact , from the proposition that a thing is qualitatively different from A , it does follow that it is also numerically different . And hence they are maintaining that every relational property is "internal to" its terms in both of two different senses at the same time . They are maintaining that , if P be a relational property which belongs to A , then P is internal to A both in the sense (1) that the absence of P entails qualitative difference from A; and (2) that the absence of P entails numerical difference from A . It seems to me that neither of these propositions is true; and I will say something about each in turn .  As for the first , I said before that I think some relational properties really are "internal to" their terms , though by no means all are . But , if we understand "internal to" in this first sense , I am not really sure that any are . In order to get an example of one which was , we should have , I think , to say that any two different qualities are always qualitatively different from one another: that , for instance , it is not only the case that anything which is pure red is qualitatively different from anything which is pure blue , but that the quality "pure red" itself is qualitatively different from the quality "pure blue ." I am not quite sure that we can say this , but I think we can; and if so , it is easy to get an example of a relational property which is internal in our first sense . The quality "orange" is intermediate in shade between the qualities yellow and red . This is a relational property , and it is quite clear that , on our assumption , it is an internal one . Since it is quite clear that any quality which were not intermediate between yellow and red , would necessarily be other than orange; and if any quality other than orange must be qualitatively different from orange , then it follows that "intermediate between yellow and red" is internal to "orange ." That is to say , the absence of the relational property "intermediate between yellow and red ," entails the property "different in quality from orange ."  There is then , I think , a difficulty in being sure that any relational properties are internal in this first sense . But , if what we want to do is to show that some are not , and that therefore the dogma that all relations are internal is false , I think the most conclusive reason for saying this is that if all were internal in this first sense , all would necessarily be internal in the second , and that this is plainly false . I think , in fact , the most important consequence of the dogma that all relations are internal , is that it follows from it that all relational properties are internal in this second sense . I propose , therefore , at once to consider this proposition , with a view to bringing out quite clearly what it means and involves , and what are the main reasons for saying that it is false .  The proposition in question is that , if P be a relational property and A a term to which it does in fact belong , then , no matter what P and A may be , it may always be truly asserted of them , that any term which had not possessed P would necessarily have been other than--numerically different from--A: or in other words , that A would necessarily , in all conceivable circumstances , have possessed P . And with this sense of "internal ," as distinguished from that which says qualitatively different , it is quite easy to point out some relational properties which certainly are internal in this sense . Let us take as an example the relational property which we assert to belong to a visual sense-datum when we say of it that it has another visual sense-datum as a spatial part: the assertion , for instance , with regard to a coloured patch half of which is red and half yellow . "This whole patch contains this patch" (where "this patch" is a proper name for the red half) . It is here , I think , quite plain that , in a perfectly clear and intelligible sense , we can say that any whole , which had not contained that red patch , could not have been identical with the whole in question: that from the proposition with regard to any term whatever that it does not contain that particular patch it follows that that term is other than the whole in question--though not necessarily that it is qualitatively different from it . That particular whole could not have existed without having that particular patch for a part . But it seems no less clear , at first sight , that there are many other relational properties of which this is not true . In order to get an example , we have only to consider the relation which the red patch has to the whole patch , instead of considering as before that which the whole has to it . It seems quite clear that , though the whole could not have existed without having the red patch for a part , the red patch might perfectly well have existed without being part of that particular whole . In other words , though every relational property of the form "having this for a spatial part" is "internal" in our sense , it seems equally clear that every property of the form "is a spatial part of this whole" is not internal , but purely external . Yet this last , according to me , is one of the things which the dogma of internal relations denies . It implies that it is just as necessary that anything , which is in fact a part of a particular whole , should be a part of that whole , as that any whole , which has a particular thing for a part , should have that thing for a part . It implies , in fact , quite generally , that any term which does in fact have a particular relational property , could not have existed without having that property . And in saying this it obviously flies in the face of common sense . It seems quite obvious that in the case of many relational properties which things have , the fact that they have them is a mere matter of fact: that the things in question might have existed without having them . That this , which seems obvious , is true , seems to me to be the most important thing that can be meant by saying that some relations are purely external . And the difficulty is to see how any philosopher could have supposed that it was not true: that , for instance , the relation of part to whole is no more external than that of whole to part . I will give at once one main reason which seems to me to have led to the view , that all relational properties are internal in this sense .  What I am maintaining is the common-sense view , which seems obviously true , that it may be true that A has in fact got P and yet also true that A might have existed without having P . And I say that this is equivalent to saying that it may be true that A has P , and yet not true that from the proposition that a thing has not got P it follows that that thing is other than A--numerically different from it . And one reason why this is disputed is , I think , simply because it is in fact true that if A has P , and x has not , it does follow that x is other than A . These two propositions , the one which I admit to be true (1) that if A has P , and x has not , it does follow that x is other than A , and the one which I maintain to be false (2) that if A has P , then from the proposition with regard to any term x that it has not got P , it follows that x is other than A , are , I think , easily confused with one another . And it is in fact the case that if they are not different , or if (2) follows from (1) , then no relational properties are external . For (1) is certainly true , and (2) is certainly equivalent to asserting that none are . It is therefore absolutely essential , if we are to maintain external relations , to maintain that (2) does not follow from (1) . These two propositions (1) and (2) , with regard to which I maintain that (1) is true , and (2) is false , can be put in another way , as follows: (1) asserts that if A has P , then any term which has not , must be other than A . (2) asserts that if A has P , then any term which had not , would necessarily be other than A . And when they are put in this form , it is , I think , easy to see why they should be confused: you have only to confuse "must" or "is necessarily" with "would necessarily be ." And their connexion with the question of external relations can be brought out as follows: To maintain external relations you have to maintain such things as that , though Edward VII was in fact father of George V , he might have existed without being father of George V . But to maintain this , you have to maintain that it is not true that a person who was not father of George would necessarily have been other than Edward . Yet it is , in fact , the case , that any person who was not the father of George , must have been other than Edward . Unless , therefore , you can maintain that from this true proposition it does not follow that any person who was not father of George would necessarily have been other than Edward , you will have to give up the view that Edward might have existed without being father of George .  By far the most important point in connexion with the dogma of internal relations seems to me to be simply to see clearly the difference between these two propositions (1) and (2) , and that (2) does not follow from (1) . If this is not understood , nothing in connexion with the dogma , can , I think , be understood . And perhaps the difference may seem so clear , that no more need be said about it . But I cannot help thinking it is not clear to everybody , and that it does involve the rejection of certain views , which are sometimes held as to the meaning of "follows ." So I will try to put the point again in a perfectly strict form .  Let P be a relational property , and A a term to which it does in fact belong . I propose to define what is meant by saying that P is internal to A (in the sense we are now concerned with) as meaning that from the proposition that a thing has not got P , it "follows" that it is other than A .  That is to say , this proposition asserts that between the two properties "not having P" and "other than A ," there holds that relation which holds between the property "being a right angle" and the property "being an angle ," or between the property "red" and the property "coloured ," and which we express by saying that , in the case of any thing whatever , from the proposition that that thing is a right angle it follows , or is deducible , that it is an angle .  Let us now adopt certain conventions for expressing this proposition .  We require , first of all , some term to express the converse of that relation which we assert to hold between a particular proposition q and a particular proposition p , when we assert that q follows from or is deducible from p . Let us use the term "entails" to express the converse of this relation . We shall then be able to say truly that "p entails q ," when and only when we are able to say truly that "q follows from p" or "is deducible from p ," in the sense in which the conclusion of a syllogism in Barbara follows from the two premisses , taken as one conjunctive proposition; or in which the proposition "This is coloured" follows from "This is red ." "p entails q" will be related to "q follows from , p" in the same way in which "A is greater than B" is related to "B is less than A ."  We require , next , some short and clear method of expressing the proposition , with regard to two properties P and Q , that any proposition which asserts of a given thing that it has the property P entails the proposition that the thing in question also has the property Q . Let us express this proposition in the form  xP entails xQ  That is to say "xP entails xQ" is to mean the same as "Each one of all the various propositions , which are alike in respect of the fact that each asserts with regard to some given thing that that thing has P , entails that one among the various propositions , alike in respect of the fact that each asserts with regard to some given thing that that thing has Q , which makes this assertion with regard to the same thing , with regard to which the proposition of the first class asserts that it has P ." In other words "xP entails xQ" is to be true , if and only if the proposition "AP entails AQ" is true , and if also all propositions which resemble this , in the way in which "BP entails BQ" resembles it , are true also; where "AP" means the same as "A has P ," "AQ" the same as "A has Q" etc . , etc .  We require , next , some way of expressing the proposition , with regard to two properties P and Q , that any proposition which denies of a given thing that it has P entails the proposition , with regard to the thing in question , that it has Q .  Let us , in the case of any proposition , p , express the contradictory of that proposition by p . The proposition "It is not the case that A has P" will then be expressed by °AP°; and it will then be natural , in accordance with the last convention to express the proposition that any proposition which denies of a given thing that it has P entails the proposition , with regard to the thing in question ,  that it has Q , by  °xP° entails xQ .  And we require , finally , some short way of expressing the proposition , with regard to two things B and A , that B is other than (or not identical with) A . Let us express "B is identical with A" by "B = A"; and it will then be natural , according to the last convention , to express "B is not identical with A" by  °B = A .°  We have now got everything which is required for expressing , in a short symbolic form , the proposition , with regard to a given thing A and a given relational property P , which A in fact possesses , that P is internal to A . The required expression is  xP entails (°x = A°)  which is to mean the same as "Every proposition which asserts of any given thing that it has not got P entails the proposition , with regard to the thing in question , that it is other than A ." And this proposition is , of course , logically equivalent to  (x = A) entails x P  where we are using "logically equivalent ," in such a sense that to say of any proposition p that it is logically equivalent to another proposition q is to say that both p entails q and q entails p . This last proposition again , is , so far as I can see , either identical with or logically equivalent to the propositions expressed by "anything which were identical with A would , in any conceivable universe , necessarily have P" or by "A could not have existed in any possible world without having P"; just as the proposition expressed by "In any possible world a right angle must be an angle" is , I take it , either identical with or logically equivalent to the proposition "(x is a right angle) entails (r is an angle) ."  We have now , therefore , got a short means of symbolising , with regard to any particular thing A and any particular property P , the proposition that P is internal to A in the second of the two senses distinguished on p . 286 . But we still require a means of symbolising the general proposition that every relational property is internal to any term which possesses it--the proposition , namely , which was referred to on p . 287 , as the most important consequence of the dogma of internal relations , and which was called (2) on p . 289 .  In order to get this , let us first get a means of expressing with regard to some one particular relational property P , the proposition that P is internal to any term which possesses it . This is a proposition which takes the form of asserting with regard to one particular property , namely P , that any term which possesses that property also possesses another--namely the one expressed by saying that P is internal to it . It is , that is to say , an ordinary universal proposition , like "All men are mortal ." But such a form of words is , as has often been pointed out , ambiguous . It may stand for either of two different propositions . It may stand merely for the proposition "There is nothing , which both is a man , and is not mortal"--a proposition which may also be expressed by "If anything is a man , that thing is mortal ," and which is distinguished by the fact that it makes no assertion as to whether there are any men or not; or it may stand for the conjunctive proposition "If anything is a man , that thing is mortal , and there are men ." It will be sufficient for our purposes to deal with propositions of the first kind--those namely , which assert with regard to some two properties , say Q and R , that there is nothing which both does possess Q and does not possess R , without asserting that anything does possess Q . Such a proposition is obviously equivalent to the assertion that any pair of propositions which resembles the pair "AQ" and "AR ," in respect of the fact that one of them asserts of some particular thing that it has Q and the other , of the same thing , that it has R , stand to one another in a certain relation: the relation , namely , which , in the case of "AQ" and "AR ," can be expressed by saying that "It is not the case both that A has Q and that A has not got R ." When we say "There is nothing which does possess Q and does not possess R" we are obviously saying something which is either identical with or logically equivalent to the proposition "In the case of every such pair of propositions it is not the case both that the one which asserts a particular thing to have Q is true , and that the one which asserts it to have R is false ." We require , therefore , a short way of expressing the relation between two propositions p and q , which can be expressed by "It is not the case that p is true and q false ." And I am going , quite arbitrarily to express this relation by writing  p * q  for "It is not the case that p is true and q false ."  The relation in question is one which logicians have sometimes expressed by "p implies q ." It is , for instance , the one which Mr . Russell in the 'Principles of Mathematics calls "material implication ," and which he and Dr . Whitehead in Principia Mathematica call simply "implication ." And if we do use "implication" to stand for this relation , we , of course , got the apparently paradoxical results that every false proposition implies every other proposition , both true and false , and that every true proposition implies every other true proposition: since it is quite clear that if p is false then , whatever q may be , "it is not the case that p is true and q false ," and quite clear also , that if p and q are both true , then also "it is not the case that p is true and q false ." And these results , it seems to me , appear to be paradoxical , solely because , if we use "implies" in any ordinary sense , they are quite certainly false . Why logicians should have thus chosen to use the word "implies" as a name for a relation , for which it never is used by any one else , I do not know . It is partly , no doubt , because the relation for which they do use it--that expressed by saying "It is not the case that p is true and q false"--is one for which it is very important that they should have a short name , because it is a relation which is very fundamental and about which they need constantly to talk , while (so far as I can discover) it simply has no short name in ordinary life . And it is partly , perhaps , for a reason which leads us back to our present reason for giving some name to this relation . It is , in fact , natural to use "p implies q" to mean the same as "If p , then q ." And though "If p then q" is hardly ever , if ever , used to mean the same as "It is not the case that p is true and q false"; yet the expression "If anything has Q , it has R" may , I think , be naturally used to express the proposition that , in the case of every pair of propositions which resembles the pair A Q and A R in respect of the fact that the first of the pair asserts of some particular thing that it has Q and the second , of the same thing , that it has R , it is not the case that the first is true and the second false . That is to say , if (as I propose to do) we express "It is not the case both that AQ is true and AR false" by  AQ * AR ,  and if , further (on the analogy of the similar case with regard to "entails) ," we express the proposition that of every pair of propositions which resemble A Q and A R in the respect just mentioned , it is true that the first has the relation * to the second by  xQ * xR  then , it is natural to express xQ * xR , by "If anything has Q , then that thing has R ." And logicians may , I think , have falsely inferred that since it is natural to express "xQ * xR" by "If anything has Q , then that thing has R ," it must be natural to express "AQ * AR" by "If AQ , then AR ," and therefore also by "AQ implies AR ." If this has been their reason for expressing "p * q" by "p implies q" then obviously their reason is a fallacy . And , whatever the reason may have been , it seems to me quite certain that "AQ * AR" cannot be properly expressed either by "AQ implies AR" or by "If AQ , then AR ," although "rQ * xR" can be properly expressed by "If anything has Q , then that thing has R ."  I am going , then , to express the universal proposition , with regard to two particular properties Q and R , which asserts that "Whatever has Q , has R" or "If anything has Q , it has R ," without asserting that anything has Q , by  xQ * xR  --a means of expressing it , which since we have adopted the convention that "p * q" is to mean the same as "It is not the case that p is true and q false ," brings out the important fact that this proposition is either identical with or logically equivalent to the proposition that of every such pair of propositions as AQ and AR , it is true that it is not the case that the first is true and the second false . And having adopted this convention , we can now see how , in accordance with it , the proposition , with regard to a particular property P , that P is internal to everything which possesses it , is to be expressed . We saw that P is internal to A is to be expressed by  °xP° entails (°x = A°)  or by the logically equivalent proposition  (x = A) entails xP  And we have now only to express the proposition that anything that has P , has also the property that P is internal to it . The required expression is obviously as follows . Just as "Anything that has Q , has R" is to be expressed by  xQ * xR  so "Anything that has P , has also the property that P is internal to it" will be expressed by  xP * {°yP° entails (°y  x°)}  or by  xP * {(v  x) entails yP} .  We have thus got , in the case of any particular property P , a means of expressing the proposition that it is internal to every term that possesses it , which is both short and brings out clearly the notions that are involved in it . And we do not need , I think , any further special convention for symbolising the proposition that every relational property is internal to any term which possesses it--the proposition , namely , which I called (2) above (pp . 289 , 290) , and which on p . 287 , I called the most important consequence of the dogma of internal relations . We can express it simply enough as follows:--  (2) = "What we assert of P when we say xP * {°yP° entails (°y = x°)} can be truly asserted of every relational property ."  And now , for the purpose of comparing (2) with (1) , and seeing exactly what is involved in my assertion that (2) does not follow from (1) , let us try to express (1) by means of the same conventions .  Let us first take the assertion with regard to a particular thing A and a particular relational property P that , from the proposition that A has P it follows that nothing which has not got P is identical with A . This is an assertion which is quite certainly true; since , if anything which had not got P were identical with A , it would follow that °AP°; and from the proposition AP , it certainly follows that °AP° is false , and therefore also that "Something which has not got P is identical with A" is false , or that "Nothing which has not got P is identical with A" is true . And this assertion , in accordance with the conventions we have adopted , will be expressed  by  AP entails {°xP° * (°x = A°)}  We want , next , in order to express (1) , a means of expressing with regard to a particular relational property P , the assertion that , from the proposition , with regard to anything whatever , that that thing has got P , it follows that nothing which has not got P is identical with the thing in question . This also is an assertion which is quite certainly true; since it merely asserts (what is obviously true) that what  AP entails {°xP° * (°x = A°)}  asserts of A , can be truly asserted of anything whatever . And this assertion , in accordance with the conventions we have adopted , will be expressed by  xP entails {°yP° * (°y = x°)} .  The proposition , which I meant to call (1) , but which I expressed before rather clumsily , can now be expressed by  (1) = "What we assert of P , when we say ,  xP entails {°yP° * (°y = x°)}  can be truly asserted of every relational property ." This is a proposition which is again quite certainly true; and , in order to compare it with (2) , there is , I think , no need to adopt any further convention for expressing it , since the questions whether it is or is not different from (2) , and whether (2) does or does not follow from it , will obviously depend on the same questions with regard to the two propositions , with regard to the particular relational property , P ,  xP entails {°yP° * (°y = x°)}  and  xP * {yP entails (y = x)}  Now what I maintain with regard to (1) and (2) is that , whereas (1) is true , (2) is false . I maintain , that is to say , that the proposition "What we assert of P , when we say  xP * {°yP° entails (°y = x°)} .  is true of every relational property" is false , though I admit that what we here assert of P is true of some relational properties . Those of which it is true , I propose to call internal relational properties , those of which it is false external relational properties . The dogma of internal relations , on the other hand , implies that (2) is true; that is to say , that every relational property is internal and that there are no external relational properties . And what I suggest is that the dogma of internal relations has been held only because (2) has been falsely thought to follow from (1) .  And that (2) does not follow from (1) , can , I think , be easily seen as follows . It can follow from (1) only if from any proposition of the form  p entails (q * r)  there follows the corresponding proposition of the form  p * (q entails r) ,  And that this is not the case can , I think , be easily seen by considering the following three propositions . Let p = "All the books on this shelf are blue ," let q = "My copy of the Principles of Mathematics is a book on this shelf ," and let r = "My copy of the Principles of Mathematics is blue ." Now p here does absolutely entail (q * r) . That is to say , it absolutely follows from p that "My copy of the Principles is on this shelf ," and "My copy of the Principles is not blue ," are not , as a matter of fact , both true . But it by no means follows from this that p * (q entails r) . For what this latter proposition means is "It is not the case both that p is true and that (q entails r) is false ." And , as a matter of fact , (q entails r) is quite certainly false; for from the proposition "My copy of the Principles is on this shelf" the proposition "My copy of the Principles is blue" does not follow . It is simply not the case that the second of these two propositions can be deduced from the first by itself: it is simply not the case that it stands to it in the relation in which it does stand to the conjunctive proposition "All the books on this shelf are blue and , my copy of the Principles is on this shelf ." This conjunctive proposition really does entail "My copy of the Principles is blue ." But "My copy of the Principles is on this shelf ," by itself quite certainly does not entail "My copy of the Principles is blue ." It is simply not the case that my copy of the Principles couldn't have been on this shelf without being blue , (q entails r) is , therefore , false . And hence "p * (q entails r) ," can only follow from "p entails (q * r) ," if from this latter proposition °p° follows . But p quite certainly does not follow from this proposition: from the fact that (q * r) is deducible from p , it does not in the least follow that °p° is true . It is , therefore , clearly not the case that every proposition of the form  p entails (q * r)  entails the corresponding proposition of the form  p * {q entails r} ,  since we have found one particular proposition of the first form which does not entail the corresponding proposition of the second .  To maintain , therefore , that (2) follows from (1) is mere confusion . And one source of the confusion is , I think , pretty plain . (1) does allow you to assert that , if AP is true , then the proposition "°yP° * {°(y = A°)}" must be true . What the "must" here expresses is merely that this proposition follows from AP , not that it is in itself a necessary proposition . But it is supposed , through confusion , that what is asserted is that it is not the case both that AP is true and that "°yP° * (°y = A°)" is not , in itself , a necessary proposition; that is to say , it is supposed that what is asserted is "AP + {°yP° entails (°y = A°)}"; since to say that "°yP° * (°y = A°)" is , in itself , a necessary proposition is the same thing as to say that "°yP° entails (°y = A°)" is also true . In fact it seems to me pretty plain that what is meant by saying of propositions of the form "xP * xQ" that they are necessary (or "apodeictic") propositions , is merely that the corresponding proposition of the form "xP entails xQ" is also true , "xP entails xQ" is not itself a necessary proposition; but , if "xP entails xQ" is true , then "xP * xQ" is a necessary proposition--and a necessary truth , since no false propositions are necessary in themselves . Thus what is meant by saying that "Whatever is a right angle , is also an angle" is a necessary truth , is , so far as I can see , simply that the proposition "(x is a right angle) entails (x is an angle)" is also true . This seems to me to give what has , in fact , been generally meant in philosophy by "necessary truths ," e .g . by Leibniz; and to point out the distinction between them and those true universal propositions which are "mere matters of fact ." And if we want to extend the meaning of the name "necessary truth" in such a way that some singular propositions may also be said to be "necessary truths ," we can , I think , easily do it as follows . We can say that AP is itself a necessary truth , if and only if the universal proposition "(x = A) * xP" (which , as we have seen , follows from AP) is a necessary truth: that is to say , if and only if (x = A) entails xP . With this definition , what the dogma of internal relations asserts is that in every case in which a given thing actually has a given relational property , the fact that it has that property is a necessary truth; whereas what I am asserting is that , if the property in question is an "internal" property , then the fact in question will be a necessary truth , whereas if the property in question is "external ," then the fact in question will be a mere "matter of fact ."  So much for the distinction between (1) which is true , and (2) , or the dogma of internal relations , which I hold to be false . But I said above , in passing , that my contention that (2) does not follow from (1) , involves the rejection of certain views that have sometimes been held as to the meaning of "follows"; and I think it is worth while to say something about this .  It is obvious that the possibility of maintaining that (2) does not follow from (1) , depends upon its being true that from "xP * xQ" the proposition "xP entails xQ" does not follow . And this has sometimes been disputed , and is , I think , often not clearly seen .  To begin with , Mr . Russell , in the Principles of Mathematics (p . 34) , treats the phrase "q can be deduced from p" as if it meant exactly the same thing as "p * q" or "p materially implies q"; and has repeated the same error elsewhere , e .g . in Philosophical Essays (p . 166) , where he is discussing what he calls the axiom of internal relations . And I am afraid a good many people have been led to suppose that , since Mr . Russell has said this , it must be true . If it were true , then , of course , it would be impossible to distinguish between (1) and (2) , and it would follow that , since (1) certainly is true , what I am calling the dogma of internal relations is true too . But I imagine that Mr . Russell himself would now be willing to admit that , so far from being true , the statement that "q can be deduced from p" means the same as "p * q" is simply an enormous "howler"; and I do not think I need spend any time in trying to show that it is so .  But it may be held that , though "p entails q" does not mean the same as "p * q ," yet nevertheless from "xP * xQ" the proposition "xP entails xQ" does follow , for a somewhat more subtle reason; and , if this were so , it would again follow that what I am calling the dogma of internal relations must be true . It may be held , namely , that though "AP entails AQ" does not mean simply "AP * AQ" yet what it does mean is simply the conjunction "AP * AQ and this proposition is an instance of a true formal implication" (the phrase "formal implication" being understood in Mr . Russell's sense , in which "xP * xQ" asserts a formal implication) . This view as to what "AP entails AQ" means , has , for instance , if I understand him rightly , been asserted by Mr . O . Strachey in Mind , N .S . , 93 . And the same view has been frequently suggested (though I do not know that he has actually asserted it) by Mr . Russell himself (e .g . , Principia Mathematica , p . 21) . If this view were true , then , though "xP entails xQ" would not be identical in meaning with "xP * xQ ," yet it would follow from it; since , if  xP * xQ  were true , then every particular assertion of the form AP * AQ , would not only be true , but would be an instance of a true formal implication (namely "xP * xQ") and this , according to the proposed definition , is all that "xP entails xQ" asserts . If , therefore , it were true , it would again follow that all relational properties must be internal . But that this view also is untrue appears to me perfectly obvious . The proposition that I am in this room does "materially imply" that I am more than five years old , since both are true; and the assertion that it does is also an instance of a true formal implication , since it is in fact true that all the persons in this room are more than five years old; but nothing appears to me more obvious than that the second of these two propositions can not be deduced from the first--that the kind of relation which holds between the premisses and conclusion of a syllogism in Barbara does not hold between them . To put it in another way: it seems to me quite obvious that the properties "being a person in this room" and "being more than five years old" are not related in the kind of way in which "being a right angle" is related to "being an angle ," and which we express by saying that , in the case of every term , the proposition that that term is an angle can be deduced from the proposition that it is a right angle .  These are the only two suggestions as to the meaning of "p entails q" known to me , which , if true , would yield the result that (2) does follow from (1) , and that therefore all relational properties are internal; and both of these , it seems to me , are obviously false . All other suggested meanings , so far as I know , would leave it true that (2) does not follow from (1) , and therefore that I may possibly be right in maintaining that some relational properties are external . It might , for instance , be suggested that the last proposed definition should be amended as follows--that we should say: "p entails q" means "p * q and this proposition is an instance of a formal implication , which is not merely true but self-evident , like the laws of Formal Logic ." This proposed definition would avoid the paradoxes involved in Mr . Strachey's definition , since such true formal implications as "all the persons in this room are more than five years old" are certainly not self-evident; and , so far as I . can see , it may state something which is in fact true of p and q , whenever and only when p entails q . I do not myself think that it gives the meaning of "p entails q ," since the kind of relation which I see to hold between the premisses and conclusion of a syllogism seems to me to be one which is purely "objective" in the sense that no psychological term , such as is involved in the meaning of "self-evident ," is involved in its definition (if it has one) . I am not , however , concerned to dispute that some such definition of "p entails q" as this may be true . Since it is evident that , even if it were , my proposition that "xP entails xQ" does not follow from "xP * xQ ," would still be true; and hence also my contention that (2) does not follow from (1) .  So much by way of arguing that we are not bound to hold that all relational properties are internal in the particular sense , with which we are now concerned , in which to say that they are means that in every case in which a thing A has a relational property , it follows from the proposition that a term has not got that property that the term in question is other than A . But I have gone further and asserted that some relational properties certainly are not internal . And in defence of this proposition I do not know that I have anything to say but that it seems to me evident in many cases that a term which has a certain relational property might quite well not have had it: that , for instance , from the mere proposition that this is this , it by no means follows that this has to other things all the relations which it in fact has . Everybody , of course , must admit that if all the propositions which assert of it that it has these properties , do in fact follow from the proposition that this is this , we cannot see that they do . And so far as I can see , there is no reason of any kind for asserting that they do , except the confusion which I have exposed . But it seems to me further that we can see in many cases that the proposition that this has that relation does not follow from the fact that it is this: that , for instance , the proposition that Edward VII was father of George V is a mere matter of fact .  I want now to return for a moment to that other meaning of "internal ," (p . 286) in which to say that P is internal to A means not merely that anything which had not P would necessarily be other than A , but that it would necessarily be qualitatively different . I said that this was the meaning of "internal" in which the dogma of internal relations holds that all relational properties are "internal"; and that one of the most important consequences which followed from it , was that all relational properties are "internal" in the less extreme sense that we have just been considering . But , if I am not mistaken , there is another important consequence which also follows from it , namely , the Identity of Indiscernibles . For if it be true , in the case of every relational property , that any term which had net that property would necessarily be qualitatively different from any which had , it follows of course that , in the case of two terms one of which has a relational property , which the other has not the two are qualitatively different . But , from the proposition that x is other than y , it does follow that x has some relational property which y has not; and hence , if the dogma of internal relations be true , it will follow that if x is other than y , x is always also qualitatively different from y , which is the principle of Identity of Indiscernibles . This is , of course , a further objection to the dogma of internal relations , since I think it is obvious that the principle of Identity of Indiscernibles is not true . Indeed , so far as I can see , the dogma of internal relations essentially consists in the joint assertion of two indefensible propositions: (1) the proposition that in the case of no relational property is it true of any term which has got that property , that it might not have had it and (2) the Identity of Indiscernibles .  I want , finally , to say something about the phrase which Mr . Russell uses in the Philosophical Essays to express the dogma of internal relations . He says it may be expressed in the form "Every relation is grounded in the natures of the related terms" (p . 160) . And it can be easily seen , if the account which I have given be true , in what precise sense it does hold this . Mr . Russell is uncertain as to whether by "the nature" of a term is to be understood the term itself or something else . For my part it seems to me that by a term's nature is meant , not the term itself , but what may roughly be called all its qualities as distinguished from its relational properties . But whichever meaning we take , it will follow from what I have said , that the dogma of internal relations does imply that every relational property which a term has is , in a perfectly precise sense , grounded in its nature . It will follow that every such property is grounded in the term , in the sense that , in the case of every such property , it follows from the mere proposition that that term is that term that it has the property in question . And it will also follow that any such property is grounded in the qualities which the term has , in the sense , that if you take all the qualities which the term has , it will again follow in the case of each relational property , from the proposition that the term has all those qualities that it has the relational property in question; since this is implied by the proposition that in the case of any such property , any term which had not had it would necessarily have been different in quality from the term in question . In both of these two senses , then , the dogma of internal relations does , I think , imply that every relational property is grounded in the nature of every term which possesses it; and in this sense that proposition is false . Yet it is worth noting , I think , that there is another sense of "grounded" in which it may quite well be true that every relational property is grounded in the nature of any term which possesses it . Namely that , in the case of every such property , the term in question has some quality without which it could not have had the property . In other words that the relational property entails some quality in the term , though no quality in the term entails the relational property .     THE NATURE OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY   I should like , if I can , to interest you to-night in one particular question about Moral Philosophy . It is a question which resembles most philosophical questions , in respect of the fact that philosophers are by no means agreed as to what is the right answer to it: some seem to be very strongly convinced that one answer is correct , while others are equally strongly convinced of the opposite . For my own part I do feel some doubt as to which answer is the right one , although , as you will see , I incline rather strongly to one of the two alternatives . I should like very much , if I could , to find some considerations which seemed to me absolutely convincing on the one side or the other; for the question seems to me in itself to be an exceedingly interesting one .  I have said that the question is a question about Moral Philosophy; and it seems to me in fact to be a very large and general question which affects the whole of Moral Philosophy . In asking it , we are doing no less than asking what it is that people are doing when they study Moral Philosophy at all: we are asking what sort of questions it is which it is the business of Moral Philosophy to discuss and try to find the right answer to . But I intend , for the sake of simplicity , to confine myself to asking it in two particular instances . Moral Philosophy has , in fact , to discuss a good many different ideas; and though I think this same question may be raised with regard to them all , I intend to pick out two , which seem to me particularly fundamental , and to ask it with regard to them only .  My first business must be to explain what these two ideas are .  The name Moral Philosophy naturally suggests that what is meant is a department of philosophy which has something to do with morality . And we all understand roughly what is meant by morality . We are accustomed to the distinction between moral good and evil , on the one hand , and what is sometimes called physical good and evil on the other . We all make the distinction between a man's moral character , on the one hand , and his agreeableness or intellectual endowments , on the other . We feel that to accuse a man of immoral conduct is quite a different thing from accusing him merely of bad taste or bad manners , or from accusing him merely of stupidity or ignorance . And no less clearly we distinguish between the idea of being under a moral obligation to do a thing , and the idea of being merely under a legal obligation to do it . It is a commonplace that the sphere of morality is much wider than the sphere of law: that we are morally bound to do and avoid many things , which are not enjoined or forbidden by the laws of our country; and it is also sometimes held that , if a particular law is unjust or immoral , it may even be a moral duty to disobey it--that is to say that there may be a positive conflict between moral and legal obligation; and the mere fact that this is held , whether truly or falsely , shows , at all events , that the one idea is quite distinct from the other .  The name Moral Philosophy , then , naturally suggests that it is a department of philosophy concerned with morality in this common sense . And it is , in fact , true that one large department of Moral Philosophy is so concerned . But it would be a mistake to think that the whole subject is only concerned with morality . Another important department of it is , as I shall try to show , concerned with ideas which are not moral ideas , in this ordinary sense , though , no doubt , they may have something to do with them . And of the two ideas which I propose to pick out for discussion , while one of them is a moral idea , the other belongs to that department of Moral Philosophy , which is not concerned solely with morality , and is not , I think , properly speaking , a moral idea at all .  Let us begin with the one of the two , which is a moral idea .  The particular moral idea which I propose to pick out for discussion is the one which I have called above the idea of moral obligation--the idea of being morally bound to act in a particular way on a particular occasion . But what is , so far as I can see , precisely the same idea is also called by several other names . To say that I am under a moral obligation to do a certain thing is , I think , clearly to say the same thing as what we commonly express by saying that I ought to do it , or that it is my duty to do it . That is to say , the idea of moral obligation is identical with the idea of the moral "ought" and with the idea of duty . And it also seems at first sight as if we might make yet another identification .  The assertion that I ought to do a certain thing seems as if it meant much the same as the assertion that it would be wrong of me not to do the thing in question: at all events it is quite clear that , whenever it is my duty to do anything , it would be wrong of me not to do it , and that whenever it would be wrong of me to do anything , then it is my duty to refrain from doing it . In the case of these two ideas , the idea of what is wrong , and the idea of what is my duty or what I ought to do , different views may be taken as to whether the one is more fundamental than the other , or whether both are equally so; and on the question: If one of the two is more fundamental than the other , which of the two is so ? Thus some people would say , that the idea of "wrong" is the more fundamental , and that the idea of "duty" is to be defined in terms of it: that , in fact , the statement "It is my duty to keep that promise" merely means "It would be wrong of me not to keep it"; and the statement "It is my duty not to tell a lie" merely means "It would be wrong of me to tell one ." Others again would apparently say just the opposite: that duty is the more fundamental notion , and "wrong" is to be defined in terms of it . While others perhaps would hold that neither is more fundamental than the other; that both are equally fundamental , and that the statement "it would be wrong to do so and so" is only equivalent to , not identical in meaning with , "I ought not to do it ." But whichever of these three views be the true one , there is , I think , no doubt whatever about the equivalence notion of the two ideas; and no doubt , therefore , that whatever answer be given to the question I am going to raise about the one , the same answer must be given to the corresponding question about the other .  The moral idea , then , which I propose to discuss , is the idea of duty or moral obligation , or , what comes to the same thing , the idea of what is wrong--morally wrong . Everybody would agree that this idea--or , to speak more accurately , one or both of these two ideas--is among the most fundamental of our moral ideas , whether or not they would admit that all others , for example the ideas of moral goodness , involve a reference to this one in their definition , or would hold that we have some others which are independent of it , and equally fundamental with it .  But there is a good deal of difficulty in getting clear as to what this idea of moral obligation itself is . Is there in fact only one idea which we call by this name ? Or is it possible that on some occasions when we say that so and so is a duty , we mean something different by this expression from what we do on others ? And that similarly when we say that so and so is morally wrong , we sometimes use this name "morally wrong" for one idea and sometimes for another; so that one and the same thing may be "morally wrong" in one sense of the word , and yet not morally wrong in another ? I think , in fact , there are two different senses in which we use these terms; and to point out the difference between them , will help to bring out clearly more the nature of each . And I think perhaps the difference can be brought out most clearly by considering the sort of moral rules with which we are all of us familiar .  Everybody knows that moral teachers are largely concerned in laying down moral rules , and in disputing the truth of rules which have been previously accepted . And moral rules seem to consist , to a very large extent , in assertions to the effect that it is always wrong to do certain actions or to refrain from doing certain others; or (what comes to the same thing) that it is always your duty to refrain from certain actions , and positively to do certain others . The Ten Commandments for example , are instances of moral rules; and most of them are examples of what are called negative rules--that is to say rules which assert merely that it is wrong to do certain positive actions , and therefore our duty to refrain from these actions; instead of rules which assert of certain positive actions , that it is our duty to do them and therefore wrong to refrain from doing them . The fifth commandment , which tells us to honour our father and mother , is apparently an exception; it seems to be a positive rule . It is not , like the others , expressed in the negative form "Thou shalt not do so and so ," and it is apparently really meant to assert that we ought to do certain positive actions , not merely that there are some positive action from which we ought to refrain . The difference between this one and the rest will thus serve as an example of the difference between positive and negative moral rules , a difference which is sometimes treated as if it were of great importance . And I do not wish to deny that there may be some important difference between seeing only that certain positive actions are wrong , and seeing also that , in certain cases , to refrain from doing certain actions is just as wrong as positively to do certain others . But this distinction between positive and negative rules is certainly of much less importance than another which is , I think , liable to be confused with it . So far as this distinction goes it is only a distinction between an assertion that it is wrong to do a positive action and an assertion that it is wrong to refrain from doing one: and each of these assertions is equivalent to one which asserts a duty--the first with an assertion that it is a duty to refrain , the second with an assertion that a positive action is a duty . But there is another distinction between some moral rules and others , which is of much greater importance than this one , and which does , I think , give a reason for thinking that the term "moral obligation" is actually used in different senses on different occasions .  I have said that moral rules seem to consist , to a large extent , in assertions to the effect that it is always wrong to do certain actions or to refrain from doing certain others , or the equivalent assertions in terms of duty . But there is a large class of moral rules , with which we are all of us very familiar , which do not come under this definition . They are rules which are concerned not with our actions , in the natural sense of the word , but with our feelings , thoughts and desires . An illustration of this kind of rule can again be given from the Ten Commandments . Most of the ten , as we all know , are concerned merely with actions; but the tenth at least is clearly an exception . The tenth says "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house , nor his wife , nor his servant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor anything that is his ," and , unless "covet" is merely a mistranslation of a word which stands for some kind of action , we plainly have here a rule which is concerned with our feelings and not with our actions . And one reason which makes the distinction between rules of this kind and rules concerned with actions important , is that our feelings are not , as a rule , directly within the control of our will in the sense in which many of our actions are . I cannot , for instance , by any single act of will directly prevent from arising in my mind a desire for something that belongs to some one else , even if , when once the desire has arrived , I can by my will prevent its continuance; and even this last I can hardly do directly but only by forcing myself to attend to other considerations which may extinguish the desire . But though I thus cannot prevent myself altogether from coveting my neighbour's possessions , I can altogether prevent myself from stealing them . The action of stealing , and the feeling of covetousness , are clearly on a very different level in this respect . The action is directly within the control of my will , whereas the feeling is not . If I will not to take the thing (though of course some people may find a great difficulty in willing this) it does in general follow directly that I do not take it; whereas , it I will not to desire it , it emphatically does not , even in general , follow directly that no desire for it will be there . This distinction between the way in which our feelings and our actions are under the control of our wills is , I think , a very real one indeed; we cannot help constantly recognising that it exists . And it has an important bearing on the distinction between those moral rules which deal with actions and those which deal with feelings , for the following reason . The philosopher Kant laid down a well-known proposition to the effect that "ought" implies "can": that is to say , that it cannot be true that you "ought" to do a thing , unless it is true that you could do it , if you chose . And as regards one of the senses in which we commonly use the words "ought" and "duty ," I think this rule is plainly true . When we say absolutely of ourselves or others , "I ought to do so and so" or "you ought to ," we imply , I think , very often that the thing in question is a thing which we could do , if we chose; though of course it may often be a thing which it is very difficult to choose to do . Thus it is clear that I cannot truly say of anyone that he ought to do a certain thing , if it is a thing which it is physically impossible for him to do , however desirable it may be that the thing should be done . And in this sense it is clear that it cannot be truly said of me that I ought not to have a certain feeling , or that I ought not to have had it , if it is a feeling which I could not , by any effort of my will , prevent myself from having . The having or the prevention of a certain feeling is not , of course , strictly ever a physical impossibility , but it is very often impossible , in exactly the same sense , in which actions are physically impossible--that is to say that I could not possibly get it or prevent it , even if I would . But this being so , it is plain that such a moral rule as that I ought not to covet my neighbour's possessions is , if it means to assert that I ought not , in that sense in which "ought" implies "can ," a rule which cannot possibly be true . What it appears to assert is , absolutely universally , of every feeling of covetousness , that the feeling in question is one which the person who felt it ought not to have felt . But in fact a very large proportion of such feelings (I am inclined to say the vast majority) are feelings which the person who felt them could not have prevented feeling , if he would: they were beyond the control of his will . And hence it is quite emphatically not true that none of these feelings ought to have been felt , if we are using "ought" in the sense which implies that the person who felt them could have avoided them . So far from its being true that absolutely none of them ought to have been felt , this is only true of those among them , probably a small minority , which the person who felt them could have avoided feeling . If , therefore , moral rules with regard to feelings are to have a chance of being nearly true , we must understand the "ought" which occurs in them in some other sense . But with moral rules that refer to actions the case is very different . Take stealing for example . Here again what the Eighth Commandment appears to imply is that absolutely every theft which has ever occurred was an act which the agent ought not to have done; and , if the "ought" is the one which implies "can ," it implies , therefore , that every theft was an act which the agent , if he had chosen , could have avoided . And this statement that every theft which has been committed was an act which the thief , if he had so willed , could have avoided , though it may be doubted if it is absolutely universally true , is not a statement which is clearly absurd , like the statement that every covetous desire could have been avoided by the will of the person who felt it . It is probable that the vast majority of acts of theft have been acts which it was in the power of the thief to avoid , if he had willed to do so; whereas this is clearly not true of the vast majority of covetous desires . It is , therefore , quite possible that those who believe we ought never to steal are using "ought" in a sense which implies that stealing always could have been avoided; whereas it is I think quite certain that many of those who believe that we ought to avoid all covetous desires , do not believe for a moment that every covetous desire that has ever been felt was a desire which the person who felt it could have avoided feeling , if he had chosen . And yet they certainly do believe , in some sense or other , that no covetous desire ought ever to have been felt . The conclusion is , therefore , it seems to me , unavoidable that we do use "ought ," the moral "ought ," in two different senses; the one a sense in which to say that I ought to have done so and so does really imply that I could have done it , if I had chosen , and the other a sense in which it carries with it no such implication . I think perhaps the difference between the two can be expressed in this way . If we express the meaning of the first "ought ," the one which does imply "can ," by saying that "I ought to have done so and so" means "It actually was my duty to do it"; we can express the meaning of the second by saying that e .g . "I ought not to have felt so and so" means not "it was my duty to avoid that feeling ," but "it would have been my duty to avoid it , if I had been able ." And corresponding to these two meanings of "ought" we should , I think , probably distinguish two different sorts of moral rules , which though expressed in the same language , do in fact mean very different things . The one is a set of rules which assert (whether truly or falsely) that it always actually is a duty to do or to refrain from certain actions , and assert therefore that it always is in the power of the agent's will to do or to refrain from them; whereas the other sort only assert that so and so would be a duty , if it were within our power , without at all asserting that it always is within our power .  We may , perhaps , give a name to the distinction I mean , by calling the first kind of rules--those which do assert that something actually is a duty--"rules of duty ," and by calling the second kind--those which recommend or condemn something not in the control of our wills--"ideal rules": choosing this latter name because they can be said to inculcate a moral "ideal"--something the attainment of which is not directly within the power of our wills . As a further example of the difference between ideal rules and rules of duty we may take the famous passage from the New Testament (Luke 6 , 27) "Love your enemies , do good to them that hate you , bless them that curse you , pray for them that despitefully use you ." Of these four rules , the three last may be rules of duty , because they refer to things which are plainly , as a rule , at least , in the power of your will; but the first , if "love" be understood in its natural sense as referring to your feelings , is plainly only an "ideal" rule , since such feelings are obviously not directly under our own control , in the same way in which such actions as doing good to , blessing or praying for a person are so . To love certain people , or to feel no anger against them , is a thing which it is quite impossible to attain directly by will , or perhaps ever to attain completely at all . Whereas your behaviour towards them is a matter within your own control: even if you hate a person , or feel angry with him , you can so control yourself as not to do him harm , and even to confer benefits upon him . To do good to your enemies may , then , really be your duty; but it cannot , in the strict sense , be your duty not to have evil feelings towards them: all that can possibly be true is that it would be your duty if you were able . Yet I think there can be no doubt that what Christ meant to condemn was the occurrence of such feelings altogether; and since , if what he meant to assert about them in condemning them , would have been certainly false , if he had meant to say that you could avoid ever feeling them , I think it is clear that what he meant to assert was not this , or not this only , but something else , which may quite possibly be true . That is to say , he was asserting an ideal rule , not merely a rule of duty .  It will be seen that this distinction which I am making coincides , roughly at all events , with the distinction which is often expressed as the distinction between rules which tell you what you ought to be and rules which tell you merely what you ought to do; or as the distinction between rules which are concerned with your inner life--with your thoughts and feelings--and those which are concerned only with your external actions . The rules which are concerned with what you ought to be or with your inner life are , for the most part at all events , "ideal" rules; while those which are concerned with what you ought to do or your external actions are very often , at least , rules of duty . And it is often said that one great difference between the New Testament and the Old is its comparatively greater insistence on "ideal" rules--upon a change of heart--as opposed to mere rules of duty . And that there is a comparatively greater insistence on ideal rules I do not wish to deny . But that there are plenty of ideal rules in the Old Testament too must not be forgotten . I have already given an example from the Ten Commandments: namely the rule which says you ought not to covet anything which belongs to your neighbour . And another is supplied by the Old Testament commandment , "Love thy neighbour as thyself ," if by "love" is here meant a feeling which is not within our own control , and not merely that the Jew is to help other Jews by his external actions . Indeed , however great may be the difference between the Old Testament and the New in respect of comparative insistence on ideal rules rather than rules of duty , I am inclined to think that there is at least as great a difference , illustrated by this very rule , in another , quite different , respect--namely in the kind of rules , both ideal and of duty , which are insisted on . For whereas by "thy neighbour" in the Old Testament there is plainly meant only other Jews , and it is not conceived either that it is the duty of a Jew to help foreigners in general , or an ideal for him to love them; in the New Testament , where the same words are used , "my neighbour" plainly is meant to include all mankind . And this distinction between the view that beneficent action and benevolent feelings should be confined to those of our own nation , and the view that both should be extended equally to all mankind ,--a distinction which has nothing to do with the distinction between being and doing , between inner and outer , but affects both equally--is , I am inclined to think , at least as important a difference between New Testament and Old , as the comparatively greater insistence on "ideal" rules . However , the point upon which I want at present to insist is the distinction between ideal rules and rules of duty . Both kinds are commonly included among moral rules , and , as my examples have shown , are often mentioned together as if no great difference were seen between them . What I want to insist on is that there is a great difference between them: that whereas rules of duty do directly assert of the idea of duty , in the sense in which to say that something is your duty implies that you can do it , that certain things are duties , the "ideal" rules do not assert this , but something different . Yet the "ideal" rules certainly do , in a sense , assert a "moral obligation ." And hence we have to recognise that the phrase "moral obligation" is not merely a name for one idea only , but for two very different ideas; and the same will , of course , be true of the corresponding phrase "morally wrong ."  When , therefore , I say that the idea of "moral obligation" is one of the fundamental ideas with which Moral Philosophy is concerned , I think we must admit that this one name really stands for two different ideas . But it does not matter for my purpose which of the two you take . Each of them is undoubtedly a moral idea , and whatever answer be given to the question we are going to raise about the one , will also certainly apply to the other .  But it is now time to turn to the other idea , with which I said that Moral Philosophy has been largely concerned , though it is not , strictly speaking , a moral idea , at all .  And I think , perhaps , a good way of bringing out what this idea is , is to refer to the Ethics of Aristotle . Everybody would admit that the fundamental idea , with which Aristotle's Ethics is concerned , is an idea which it is the business of Moral Philosophy to discuss; and yet I think it is quite plain that this idea is not a moral idea at all . Aristotle does not set out from' the idea of moral obligation or duty (indeed throughout his treatise he only mentions this idea quite incidentally); nor even from the idea of moral goodness or moral excellence , though he has a good deal more to say about that; but from the idea of what he calls "the human good ," or "good for man ." He starts by raising the question what the good for man is , and his whole book is arranged in the form of giving a detailed answer to that question . And I think we can gather pretty well what the idea is , which he calls by this name , by considering what he says about it . There are two points , in particular , which he insists upon from the outset: first , that nothing can be good , in the sense he means , unless it is something which is worth having for its own sake , and not merely for the sake of something else; it must be good in itself; it must not , like wealth (to use one example which he gives) be worth having merely for the sake of what you can do with it; it must be a thing which is worth having even if nothing further comes of it . And secondly (what partly covers the former , but also , I think , says something more) it must , he says , be something that is "self-sufficient": something which , even if you had nothing else would make your life worth having . And further light is thrown upon his meaning when he comes to tell you what he thinks the good for man is: the good , he says , is "mental , activity--where such activity is of an excellent kind , or , if there are several different kinds of excellent mental activity , that which has the best and most perfect kind of excellence; and also" (he significantly adds) "mental activity which lasts through a sufficiently long life ." The word which I have here translated "excellence" is what is commonly translated "virtue"; but it does not mean quite the same as we mean by "virtue ," and that in a very important respect . "Virtue" has come to mean exclusively moral excellence; and if that were all Aristotle meant , you might think that what he means by "good" came very near being a moral idea . But it turns out that he includes among "excellences ," intellectual excellence , and even that he thinks that the best and most perfect excellence of which he speaks is a particular kind of intellectual excellence , which no one would think of calling a moral quality , namely , the sort of excellence which makes a man a good philosopher . And as for the word which I have translated "activity ," the meaning of this can be best brought out by mentioning the reason which Aristotle himself gives for saying that mere excellence itself is not (as some of the Greeks had said) the good for man . He says , truly enough , that a man may possess the greatest excellence--he may be a very excellent man--even when he is asleep , or is doing nothing; and he points out that the possession of excellence when you are asleep is not a thing that is desirable for its own sake--obviously only for the sake of the effects it may produce when you wake up . It is not therefore , he thinks , mere mental excellence , but the active exercise of mental excellence--the state of a man's mind , when he not only possesses excellent faculties , moral or intellectual , but is actively engaged in using them , which really constitutes the human good .  Now , when Aristotle talks of "the good for man ," there is , I think , as my quotation is sufficient to show , a certain confusion in his mind between what is good for man and what is best for man . What he really holds is that any mental activity which exhibits excellence and is pleasurable is a good; and when he adds that , if there are many excellences , the good must be mental activity which exhibits the best of them , and that it must last through a sufficiently long life , he only means that this is necessary if a man is to get the best he can get , not that this is the only good he can get . And the idea which I wish to insist on is not , therefore , the idea of "the human good ," but the more fundamental idea of "good "; the idea , with regard to which he holds that the working of our minds in some excellent fashion is the only good thing that any of us can possess; and the idea of which "better" is the comparative , when he says that mental activity which exhibits some sorts of excellence is better than mental activity which exhibits others , though both are good , and that excellent mental activity continued over a longer time is better than the same continued for a shorter . This idea of what is "good ," in the sense in which Aristotle uses it in these cases , is an idea which we all of us constantly use , and which is certainly an idea which it is the business of Moral Philosophy to discuss , though it is not a moral idea . The main difficulty with regard to it is to distinguish it clearly from other senses in which we use the same word . For , when we say that a thing is "good ," or one thing "better" than another , we by no means always mean that it is better in this sense . Often , when we call a thing good we are not attributing to it any characteristic which it would possess if it existed quite alone , and if nothing further were to come of it; but are merely saying of it that it is a sort of thing from which other good things do in fact come , or which is such that , when accompanied by other things , the whole thus formed is "good" in Aristotle's sense , although , by itself , it is not . Thus a man may be "good ," and his character may be "good ," and yet neither are "good" in this fundamental sense , in which goodness is a characteristic which a thing would possess , if it existed quite alone . For , as Aristotle says , a good man may exist , and may have a good character , even when he is fast asleep; and yet if there were nothing in the Universe but good men , with good characters , all fast asleep , there would be nothing in it which was "good" in the fundamental sense with which we are concerned . Thus "moral goodness ," in the sense of good character , as distinguished from the actual working of a good character in various forms of mental activity , is certainly not "good" in the sense in which good means "good for its own sake ." And even with regard to the actual exercise of certain forms of moral excellence , it seems to me that in estimating the value of such exercise relatively to other things , we are apt to take into account , not merely its intrinsic value--the sort of value which it would possess , if it existed quite alone--but also its effects: we rate it higher than we should do if we were considering only its intrinsic value , because we take into account the other good things which we know are apt to flow from it . Certain things which have intrinsic value are distinguished from others , by the fact that more good consequences are apt to flow from them; and where this is the case , we are apt , I think , quite unjustly , to think that their intrinsic value must be higher too . One thing , I think , is clear about intrinsic value--goodness in Aristotle's sense--namely that it is only actual occurrences , actual states of things over a certain period of time--not such things as men , or characters , or material things , that can have any intrinsic value at all . But even this is not sufficient to distinguish intrinsic value clearly from other sorts of goodness: since even in the case of actual occurrences , we often call them good or bad for the sake of their effects or their promise of effects . Thus we all hope that the state of things in England , as a whole , will really be better some day than it has been in the past--that there will be progress and improvement: we hope , for instance , that , if we consider the whole of the lives lived in England during some year in the next century , it may turn out that the state of things , as a whole , during that year will be really better than it ever has been in any past year . And when we use "better" in this way--in the sense in which progress or improvement means a change to a better state of things--we are certainly thinking partly of a state of things which has a greater intrinsic value . And we certainly do not mean by improvement merely moral improvement . An improvement in moral conditions , other things being equal , may no doubt be a gain in intrinsic value; but we should certainly hold that , moral conditions being equal , there is yet room for improvement in other ways--in the diminution of misery and purely physical evils , for example . But in considering the degree of a real change for the better in intrinsic value , there is certainly danger of confusion between the degree in which the actual lives lived are really intrinsically better , and the degree in which there is improvement merely in the means for living a good life . If we want to estimate rightly what would constitute an intrinsic improvement in the state of things in our imagined year next century , and whether it would on the whole be really "good" at all , we have to consider what value it would have if it were to be the last year of life upon this planet; if the world were going to come to an end , as soon as it was over; and therefore to discount entirely all the promises it might contain of future goods . This criterion for distinguishing whether the kind of goodness which we are attributing to anything is really intrinsic value or not , the criterion which consists in considering whether it is a characteristic which the thing would possess , if it were to have absolutely no further consequences or accompaniments , seems to me to be one which it is very necessary to apply if we wish to distinguish clearly between different meanings of the word "good ." And it is only the idea of what is good , where by "good" is meant a characteristic which has this mark , that I want now to consider .  The two ideas , then , with regard to which I want to raise a question , are first the moral idea of "moral obligation" or "duty ," and secondly the non-moral idea of "good" in this special sense .  And the question with regard to them , which I want to raise , is this . With regard to both ideas many philosophers have thought and still think--not only think , but seem to be absolutely convinced , that when we apply them to anything--when we assert of any action that it ought not to have been done , or of any state of things that it was or would be good or better than another , then it must be the case that all that we are asserting of the thing or things in question is simply and solely that some person or set of persons actually does have , or has a tendency to have a certain sort of feeling towards the thing or things in question: that there is absolutely no more in it than this . While others seem to be convinced , no less strongly , that there is more in it than this: that when we judge that an action is a duty or is really wrong , we are not merely making a judgment to the effect that some person or set of persons , have , or tend to have a certain sort of feeling , when they witness or think of such actions , and that similarly when we judge that a certain state of things was or would be better than another , we are not merely making a judgment about the feelings which some person or set of persons would have , in witnessing or thinking of the two states of things , or in comparing them together . The question at issue between these two views is often expressed in other less clear forms . It is often expressed as the question whether the ideas of duty and of good or value , are or are not , "objective" ideas: as the problem as to the "objectivity" of duty and intrinsic value . The first set of philosophers would maintain that the notion of the "objectivity" of duty and of value is a mere chimera; while the second would maintain that these ideas really are "objective ." And others express it as the question whether the ideas of duty and of good are "absolute" or purely "relative": whether there is any such thing as an absolute duty or an absolute good , or whether good and duty are purely relative to human feelings and desires . But both these ways of expressing it are , I think , apt to lead to confusion . And another even less clear way in which it is put is by asking the question: Is the assertion that such and such a thing is a duty , or has intrinsic value , ever a dictate of reason ? But so far as I can gather , the question really at issue , and expressed in these obscure ways , is the one which I have tried to state . It is the question whether when we judge (whether truly or falsely) that an action is a duty or a state of things good , all that we are thinking about the action or the state of things in question , is simply and solely that we ourselves or others have or tend to have a certain feeling towards it when we contemplate or think of it . And the question seems to me to be of great interest , because , if this is all , then it is evident that all the ideas with which Moral Philosophy is concerned are merely psychological ideas; and all moral rules , and statements as to what is intrinsically valuable , merely true or false psychological statements; so that the whole of Moral Philosophy and Ethics will be merely departments of Psychology . Whereas , if the contrary is the case , then these two ideas of moral obligation and intrinsic value , will be no more purely psychological ideas than are the ideas of shape or size or number; and Moral Philosophy will be concerned with characteristics of actions and feelings and states of affairs , which these actions and feelings and states of affairs would or might have possessed , even if human psychology had been quite different from what it is .  Which , then , of these two views is the true one ? Are these two ideas merely psychological ideas in the sense which I have tried to explain , or are they not ?  As I have said , I feel some doubts myself whether they are or not: it does not seem to me to be a matter to dogmatize upon . But I am strongly inclined to think that they are not merely psychological; that Moral Philosophy and Ethics are not mere departments of Psychology . In favour of the view that the two ideas in question are merely psychological , there is , so far as I am aware , nothing whatever to be said , except that so many philosophers have been absolutely convinced that they are . None of them seem to me to have succeeded in bringing forward a single argument in favour of their view . And against the view that they are , there seem to me to be some quite definite arguments , though I am not satisfied that any of these arguments are absolutely conclusive . I will try to state briefly and clearly what seem to me the main arguments against the view that these are merely psychological ideas; although , in doing so , I am faced with a certain difficulty . For though , as I have said , many philosophers are absolutely convinced , that "duty" and "good" do merely stand for psychological ideas , they are by no means agreed what the psychological ideas are for which they stand . Different philosophers have hit on very different ideas as being the ideas for which they stand; and this very fact that , if they are psychological ideas at all , it is so difficult to agree as to what ideas they are , seems to me in itself to be an argument against the view that they are so .  Let me take each of the two ideas separately , and try to exhibit the sort of objection there seems to be to the view that it is merely a psychological idea .  Take first the idea of moral obligation . What purely psychological assertion can I be making about an action , when I assert that it was "wrong ," that it ought not to have been done ?  In this case , one view , which is in some ways the most plausible that can be taken , is that in every case I am merely making an assertion about my own psychology . But what assertion about my own psychology can I be making ? Let us take as an example , the view of Prof . Westermarck , which is as plausible a view of this type as any that I know of . He holds that what I am judging when I judge an action to be wrong , is merely that it is of a sort which tends to excite in me a peculiar kind of feeling--the feeling of moral indignation or disapproval . He does not say that what I am judging is that the action in question is actually exciting this feeling in me . For it is obviously not true that , when I judge an action to be much more wrong than another , I am always actually feeling much indignation at the thought of either , or much more indignation at the thought of the one than at that of the other; and it is inconceivable that I should constantly be making so great a mistake as to my own psychology , as to think that I am actually feeling great indignation when I am not . But he thinks it is plausible to say that I am making a judgment as to the tendency of such actions to excite indignation in me; that , for instance , when I judge that one is much more wrong than the other , I am merely asserting the fact , taught me by my past experience , that , if I were to witness the two actions , under similar circumstances , I should feel a much more intense indignation at the one than at the other .[1]  But there is one very serious objection to such a view , which I think that those who take it are apt not fully to realise . If this view be true , then when I judge an action to be wrong , I am merely making a judgment about my own feelings towards it; and when you judge it to be wrong , you are merely making a judgment about yours . And hence the word "wrong" in my mouth , means something entirely different from what it does in yours; just as the word "I" in my mouth stands for an entirely different person from what it does in yours--in mine it stands for me , in yours it stands for you . That is to say when I judge of a given action that it was wrong , and you perhaps of the very same action that it was not , we are not in fact differing in opinion about it at all; any more than we are differing in opinion if I make the judgment "I came from Cambridge to-day" and you make the judgment "I did not come from Cambridge to-day ." When I say "That was wrong" I am merely saying "That sort of action excites indignation in me , when I see it"; and when you say "No; it was not wrong" you are merely saying "It does not excite indignation in me , when I see it ." And obviously both judgments may perfectly well be true together; just as my judgment that I did come from Cambridge to-day and yours that you did not , may perfectly well be true together . In other words , and this is what I want to insist on , if this view be true , then there is absolutely no such thing as a difference of opinion upon moral questions . If two persons think they differ in opinion on a moral question (and it certainly seems as if they sometimes think so) , they are always , on this view , making a mistake , and a mistake so gross that it seems hardly possible that they should make it: a mistake as gross as that which would be involved in thinking that when you say "I did not come from Cambridge to-day" you are denying what I say when I say "I did ." And this seems to me to be a very serious objection to the view . Don't people , in fact , sometimes really differ in opinion on a moral question ? Certainly all appearances are in favour of the view that they do: and yet , if they do , that can only be if when I think a thing to be wrong , and you think it not to be wrong , I mean by "wrong" the very same characteristic which you mean , and am thinking that the action possesses this characteristic while you are thinking it does not . It must be the very same characteristic which we both mean; it cannot be , as this view says it is , merely that I am thinking that it has to my feelings the very same relation , which you are thinking that it has not got to yours; since , if this were all , then there would be no difference of opinion between us .  And this view that when we talk of wrong or duty , we are not merely , each of us , making a statement about the relation of the thing in question to our own feelings , may be reinforced by another consideration . It is commonly believed that some moral rules exhibit a higher morality than others: that , for instance a person who believes that it is our duty to do good to our enemies , has a higher moral belief , than one who believes that he has no such duty , but only a duty to do good to his friends or fellow-countrymen . And Westermarck himself believes that , some moral beliefs , "mark a stage of higher refinement in the evolution of the moral consciousness ."[2] But what , on his view can be meant by saying that one moral belief is higher than another ? If A believes that it is his duty to do good to his enemies and B believes that it is not , in what sense can A's belief be higher than B's ? Not , on this view , in the sense that what A believes is true , and what B believes is not; for what A is believing is merely that the idea of not doing good to your enemies tends to excite in him a feeling of moral indignation , and what B believes is merely that it does not tend to excite this feeling in him: and both beliefs may perfectly well be true; it may really be true that the same actions do excite the feeling in A , and that they don't in B . What then , could Westermarck mean by saying that A's morality is higher than B's ? So far as I can see , what , on his own views , he would have to mean is merely that he himself , Westermarck , shares A's morality and does not share B's: that it is true of him , as of A , that neglecting to do good to enemies excites his feelings of moral indignation and not true of him as it is of B , that it does not excite such feelings in him . In short he would have to say that what he means by calling A's morality the higher is merely "A's morality is my morality , and B's is not ." But it seems to me quite clear that when we say one morality is higher than another , we do not merely mean that it is our own . We are not merely asserting that it has a certain relation to our own feelings , but are asserting , if I may say so , that the person who has it has a better moral taste than the person who has not . And whether or not this means merely , as I think , that what the one believes is true , and what the other believes is false , it is at all events inconsistent with the view that in all cases we are merely making a statement about our own feelings .  For these reasons it seems to me extremely difficult to believe that when we judge things to be wrong , each of us is merely making a judgment about his own psychology . But if not about our own , then about whose ? I have already said that the view that , if the judgment is merely a psychological one at all , it is a judgment about our own psychology , is in some ways more plausible than any other view . And I think we can now see that any other view is not plausible . The alternatives are that I should be making a judgment about the psychology of all mankind , or about that of some particular section of it . And that the first alternative is not true , is , I think , evident from the fact that , when I judge an action to be wrong , I may emphatically not believe that it is true of all mankind that they would regard it with feelings of moral disapproval . I may know perfectly well that some would not . Most philosophers , therefore , have not ventured to say that this is the judgment I am making; they say , for instance , that I am making a judgment about the feelings of the particular society to which I belong--about , for instance , the feelings of an impartial spectator in that society . But , if this view be taken , it is open to the same objections as the view that I am merely making a judgment about my own feelings . If we could say that every man , when he judges a thing to be wrong , was making a statement about the feelings of all mankind , then when A says "This is wrong" and B says "No , it isn't ," they would really be differing in opinion , since A would be saying that all mankind feel in a certain way towards the action , and B would be saying that they don't . But if A is referring merely to his society and B to his , and their societies are different , then obviously they are not differing in opinion at all: it may perfectly well be true both that an impartial spectator in A's society does have a certain sort of feeling towards actions of the sort in question , and that an impartial spectator in B's does not . This view , therefore , implies that it is impossible for two men belonging to different societies ever to differ in opinion on a moral question . And this is a view which I find it almost as hard to accept as the view that no two men ever differ in opinion on one .  For these reasons I think there are serious objections to the view that the idea of moral obligation is merely a psychological idea .  But now let us briefly consider the idea of "good ," in Aristotle's sense , or intrinsic value .  As regards this idea , there is again a difference of opinion among those who hold that it is a psychological idea , as to what idea it is . The majority seem to hold that it is to be defined , somehow , in terms of desire; while others have held that what we are judging when we judge that one state of things is or would be intrinsically better than another , is rather that the belief that the one was going to be realized would , under certain circumstances , give more pleasure to some man or set of men , than the belief that the other was . But the same objections seem to me to apply whichever of these two views be taken .  Let us take desire . About whose desires am I making a judgment , when I judge that one state of things would be better than another ?  Here again , it may be said , first of all , that I am merely making a judgment about my own . But in this case the view that my judgment is merely about my own psychology is , I think , exposed to an obvious objection to which Westermarck's view that my judgments of moral obligation are about my own psychology was not exposed . The obvious objection is that it is evidently not true that I do in fact always desire more , what I judge to be better: I may judge one state of things to be better than another , even when I know perfectly well not only that I don't desire it more , but that I have no tendency to do so . It is a notorious fact that men's strongest desires are , as a rule , for things in which they themselves have some personal concern; and yet the fact that this is so , and that they know it to be so , does not prevent them from judging that changes , which would not affect them personally , would constitute a very much greater improvement in the world's condition , than changes which would . For this reason alone the view that when I judge one state of things to be better than another I am merely making a judgment about my own psychology , must , I think , be given up: it is incredible that we should all be making such mistakes about our feelings , as , on this view , we should constantly be doing . And there is , of course , besides , the same objection , as applied in the case of moral obligation: namely that , if this view were true , no two men could ever differ in opinion as to which of two states was the better , whereas it appears that they certainly sometimes do differ in opinion on such an issue .  My judgment , then , is not merely a judgment about my own psychology: but , if so , about whose psychology is it a judgment ? It cannot be a judgment that all men desire the one state more than the other; because that would include the judgment that I myself do so , which , as we have seen , I often know to be false , even while I judge that the one state really is better . And it cannot , I think , be a judgment merely about the feelings or desires of an impartial spectator in my own society; since that would involve the paradox that men belonging to different societies could never differ in opinion as to what was better . But we have here to consider an alternative , which did not arise in the case of moral obligation . It is a notorious fact that the satisfaction of some of our desires is incompatible with the satisfaction of others , and the satisfaction of those of some men with the satisfaction of those of others . And this fact has suggested to some philosophers that what we mean by saying that one state of things would be better than another , is merely that it is a state in which more of the desires , of those who were in it , would be satisfied at once , than would be the case with the other . But to this view the fundamental objection seems to me to be that whether the one state was better than the other would depend not merely upon the number of desires that were simultaneously satisfied in it , but upon what the desires were desires for . I can imagine a state of things in which all desires were satisfied , and yet can judge of it that it would not be so good as another in which some were left unsatisfied . And for this reason I cannot assent to the view that my judgment , that one state of things is better than another is merely a judgment about the psychology of the people concerned in it .  This is why I find it hard to believe that either the idea of moral obligation or the idea of intrinsic value is merely a psychological idea . It seems to me that Moral Philosophy cannot be merely a department of Psychology . But no doubt there may be arguments on the other side to which I have not done justice .   [1] E Westermarck , The Origin and Development of Moral Ideas , Vol . I , pp . 4 , 13 , 17-18 , 100-101 . On p . 105 , however , Westermarck suggests a view inconsistent with this one; namely that , when I judge an action to be wrong , I am not merely asserting that it has a tendency to excite moral indignation in me , but am also asserting that other people would be convinced that it has a tendency to excite moral indignation in them , if they "knew the act and all its attendant circumstances as well as [I do] , and if , at the same time their emotions were as refined as [mine] ."  [2] Ibid . p . 89 .   THE END  Phil Brent was plodding through the snow in the direction of the house where he lived with his step-mother and her son , when a snow-ball , moist and hard , struck him just below his ear with stinging emphasis . The pain was considerable , and Phils anger rose .  He turned suddenly , his eyes flashing fiercely , intent upon discovering who had committed this outrage , for he had no doubt that it was intentional .  He looked in all directions , but saw no one except a mild old gentleman in spectacles , who appeared to have some difficulty in making his way through the obstructed street .  Phil did not need to be told that it was not the old gentleman who had taken such an unwarrantable liberty with him . So he looked farther , but his ears gave him the first clew .  He heard a chuckling laugh , which seemed to proceed from behind the stone wall that ran along the roadside .  I will see who it is , he decided , and plunging through the snow he surmounted the wall , in time to see a boy of about his own age running away across the fields as fast as the deep snow would allow .  So its you , Jonas! he shouted wrathfully . I thought it was some sneaking fellow like you .  Jonas Webb , his step-brother , his freckled face showing a degree of dismay , for he had not calculated on discovery , ran the faster , but while fear winged his steps , anger proved the more effectual spur , and Phil overtook him after a brief run , from the effects of which both boys panted .  What made you throw that snow-ball ? demanded Phil angrily , as he seized Jonas by the collar and shook him .  You let me alone! said Jonas , struggling ineffectually in his grasp .  Answer me! What made you throw that snowball ? demanded Phil , in a tone that showed he did not intend to be trifled with .  Because I chose to , answered Jonas , his spite getting the better of his prudence . Did it hurt you ? he continued , his eyes gleaming with malice .  I should think it might . It was about as hard as a cannon-ball , returned Phil grimly . Is that all youve got to say about it ?  I did it in fun , said Jonas , beginning to see that he had need to be prudent .  Very well! I dont like your idea of fun . Perhaps you wont like mine , said Phil , as he forcibly drew Jonas back till he lay upon the snow , and then kneeling by his side , rubbed his face briskly with snow .  What are you doin ? Goin to murder me ? shrieked Jonas , in anger and dismay .  I am going to wash your face , said Phil , continuing the operation vigorously .  I say , you quit that! Ill tell my mother , ejaculated Jonas , struggling furiously .  If you do , tell her why I did it , said Phil .  Jonas shrieked and struggled , but in vain . Phil gave his face an effectual scrubbing , and did not desist until he thought he had avenged the bad treatment he had suffered .  There , get up! said he at length .  Jonas scrambled to his feet , his mean features working convulsively with anger .  Youll suffer for this! he shouted .  You wont make me! said Phil contemptuously .  Youre the meanest boy in the village .  I am willing to leave that to the opinion of all who know me .  Ill tell my mother!  Go home and tell her!  Jonas started for home , and Phil did not attempt to stop him .  As he saw Jonas reach the street and plod angrily homeward , he said to himself:  I suppose I shall be in hot water for this; but I cant help it . Mrs . Brent always stands up for her precious son , who is as like her as can be . Well , it wont make matters much worse than they have been .  Phil concluded not to go home at once , but to allow a little time for the storm to spend its force after Jonas had told his story . So he delayed half an hour and then walked slowly up to the side door . He opened the door , brushed off the snow from his boots with the broom that stood behind the door , and opening the inner door , stepped into the kitchen .  No one was there , as Phils first glance satisfied him , and he was disposed to hope that Mrs . Brent--he never called her mother--was out , but a thin , acid , measured voice from the sitting-room adjoining soon satisfied him that there was to be no reprieve .  Philip Brent , come here!  Phil entered the sitting-room .  In a rocking-chair by the fire sat a thin woman , with a sharp visage , cold eyes and firmly compressed lips , to whom no child would voluntarily draw near .  On a sofa lay outstretched the hulking form of Jonas , with whom he had had his little difficulty .  I am here , Mrs . Brent , said Philip manfully .  Philip Brent , said Mrs . Brent acidly , are you not ashamed to look me in the face ?  I dont know why I should be , said Philip , bracing himself up for the attack .  You see on the sofa the victim of your brutality , continued Mrs . Brent , pointing to the recumbent figure of her son Jonas .  Jonas , as if to emphasize these words , uttered a half groan .  Philip could not help smiling , for to him it seemed ridiculous .  You laugh , said his step-mother sharply . I am not surprised at it . You delight in your brutality .  I suppose you mean that I have treated Jonas brutally .  I see you confess it .  No , Mrs . Brent , I do not confess it . The brutality you speak of was all on the side of Jonas .  No doubt , retorted Mrs . Brent , with sarcasm .  Its the case of the wolf and the lamb over again .  I dont think Jonas has represented the matter to you as it happened , said Phil . Did he tell you that he flung a snow-ball at my head as hard as a lump of ice ?  He said he threw a little snow at you playfully and you sprang upon him like a tiger .  Theres a little mistake in that , said Phil . The snow-ball was hard enough to stun me if it had hit me a little higher . I wouldnt be hit like that again for ten dollars .  That aint so! Dont believe him , mother! said Jonas from the sofa .  And what did you do ? demanded Mrs . Brent with a frown .  I laid him down on the snow and washed his face with soft snow .  You might have given him his death of cold , said Mrs . Brent , with evident hostility . I am not sure but the poor boy will have pneumonia now , in consequence of your brutal treatment .  And you have nothing to say as to his attack upon me ? said Phil indignantly .  I have no doubt you have very much exaggerated it .  Yes , he has , chimed in Jonas from the sofa .  Phil regarded his step-brother with scorn .  Cant you tell the truth now and then , Jonas ? he asked contemptuously .  You shall not insult my boy in my presence! said Mrs . Brent , with a little spot of color mantling her high cheek-bones . Philip Brent , I have too long endured your insolence . You think because I am a woman you can be insolent with impunity , but you will find yourself mistaken . It is time that you understood something that may lead you to lower your tone . Learn , then , that you have not a cent of your own . You are wholly dependent upon my bounty .  What! Did my father leave you all his money ? asked Philip .  He was NOT your father! answered Mrs . Brent coldly .    CHAPTER II .  A STRANGE REVELATION .  Philip started in irrepressible astonishment as these words fell from the lips of his step-mother . It seemed to him as if the earth were crumbling beneath his feet , for he had felt no more certain of the existence of the universe than of his being the son of Gerald Brent .  He was not the only person amazed at this declaration . Jonas , forgetting for the moment the part he was playing , sat bolt upright on the sofa , with his large mouth wide open , staring by turns at Philip and his mother .  Gosh! he exclaimed in a tone indicating utter surprise and bewilderment .  Will you repeat that , Mrs . Brent ? asked Philip , after a brief pause , not certain that he had heard aright .  I spoke plain English , I believe , said Mrs . Brent coldly , enjoying the effect of her communication .  I said that Mr . Brent , my late husband , was not your father .  I dont believe you! burst forth Philip impetuously .  You dont wish to believe me , you mean , answered his step-mother , unmoved .  No , I dont wish to believe you , said the boy , looking her in the eye .  You are very polite to doubt a ladys word , said Mrs . Brent with sarcasm .  In such a matter as that I believe no ones word , said Phil . I ask for proof .  Well , I am prepared to satisfy you . Sit down and I will tell you the story .  Philip sat down on the nearest chair and regarded his step-mother fixedly .  Whose son am I , he demanded , if not Mr . Brents ?  You are getting on too fast . Jonas , continued his mother , suddenly turning to her hulking son , on whose not very intelligent countenance there was an expression of greedy curiosity , do you understand that what I am going to say is to be a secret , not to be spoken of to any one ?  Yesm , answered Jonas readily .  Very well . Now to proceed . Philip , you have heard probably that when you were very small your father--I mean Mr . Brent--lived in a small town in Ohio , called Fultonville ?  Yes , I have heard him say so .  Do you remember in what business he was then engaged ?  He kept a hotel .  Yes; a small hotel , but as large as the place required . He was not troubled by many guests . The few who stopped at his house were business men from towns near by , or drummers from the great cities , who had occasion to stay over a night . One evening , however , a gentleman arrived with an unusual companion--in other words , a boy of about three years of age . The boy had a bad cold , and seemed to need womanly care . Mr . Brents wife----  My mother ?  The woman you were taught to call mother , corrected the second Mrs . Brent , felt compassion for the child , and volunteered to take care of it for the night . The offer was gladly accepted , and you--for , of course , you were the child--were taken into Mrs . Brents own room , treated with simple remedies , and in the morning seemed much better . Your father--your real father--seemed quite gratified , and preferred a request . It was that your new friend would take care of you for a week while he traveled to Cincinnati on business . After dispatching this , he promised to return and resume the care of you , paying well for the favor done him . Mrs . Brent , my predecessor , being naturally fond of children , readily agreed to this proposal , and the child was left behind , while the father started for Cincinnati .  Here Mrs . Brent paused , and Philip regarded her with doubt and suspense  Well ? he said .  Oh , you want to know the rest ? said Mrs . Brent with an ironical smile . You are interested in the story ?  Yes , madam , whether it is true or not .  There isnt much more to tell , said Mrs . Brent .  A week passed . You recovered from your cold , and became as lively as ever . In fact , you seemed to feel quite at home among your new surroundings , which was rather unfortunate , FOR YOUR FATHER NEVER CAME BACK!  Never came back! repeated Philip .  No; nor was anything heard from him . Mr . and Mrs . Brent came to the conclusion that the whole thing was prearranged to get rid of you . Luckily for you , they had become attached to you , and , having no children of their own , decided to retain you . Of course , some story had to be told to satisfy the villagers . You were represented to be the son of a friend , and this was readily believed . When , however , my late husband left Ohio , and traveled some hundreds of miles eastward to this place , he dropped this explanation and represented you as his own son . Romantic , wasnt it ?  Philip looked searchingly at the face of his step-mother , or the woman whom he had regarded as such , but he could read nothing to contradict the story in her calm , impassive countenance . A great fear fell upon him that she might be telling the truth . His features showed his contending emotions . But he had a profound distrust as well as dislike of his step-mother , and he could not bring himself to put confidence in what she told him .  What proof is there of this ? he asked , after a while .  Your fathers word . I mean , of course , Mr . Brents word . He told me this story before I married him , feeling that I had a right to know .  Why didnt he tell me ? asked Philip incredulously .  He thought it would make you unhappy .  You didnt mind that , said Philip , his lips curling .  No , answered Mrs . Brent , with a curious smile . Why should I ? I never pretended to like you , and now I have less cause than ever , after your brutal treatment of my boy .  Jonas endeavored to look injured , but could not at once change the expression of his countenance .  Your explanation is quite satisfactory , Mrs . Brent , returned Philip . I dont think I stood much higher in your estimation yesterday than today , so that I havent lost much . But you havent given me any proof yet .  Wait a minute .  Mrs . Brent left the room , went up-stairs , and speedily returned , bringing with her a small daguerreotype , representing a boy of three years .  Did you ever see this before ? she asked .  No , answered Philip , taking it from her hand and eying it curiously .  When Mr . and Mrs . Brent decided that you were to be left on their hands , she proceeded , they had this picture of you taken in the same dress in which you came to them , with a view to establish your identity if at any time afterward inquiry should be made for you .  The daguerreotype represented a bright , handsome child , dressed tastefully , and more as would be expected of a city child than of one born in the country . There was enough resemblance to Philip as he looked now to convince him that it was really his picture .  I have something more to show you , said Mrs . Brent .  She produced a piece of white paper in which the daguerreotype had been folded . Upon it was some writing , and Philip readily recognized the hand of the man whom he had regarded as his father .  He read these lines:   This is the picture of the boy who was mysteriously left in the charge of Mr . Brent , April , 1863 , and never reclaimed . I have reared him as my own son , but think it best to enter this record of the way in which he came into my hands , and to preserve by the help of art his appearance at the time he first came to us . GERALD BRENT .   Do you recognize this handwriting ? asked Mrs . Brent .  Yes , answered Philip in a dazed tone .  Perhaps , she said triumphantly , you will doubt my word now .  May I have this picture ? asked Philip , without answering her .  Yes; you have as good a claim to it as any one .  And the paper ?  The paper I prefer to keep myself , said Mrs . Brent , nodding her head suspiciously . I dont care to have my only proof destroyed .  Philip did not seem to take her meaning , but with the daguerreotype in his hand , he left the room .  I say , mother , chuckled Jonas , his freckled face showing his enjoyment , its a good joke on Phil , isnt it ? I guess he wont be quite so uppish after this .     CHAPTER III .  PHILS SUDDEN RESOLUTION .  When Phil left the presence of Mrs . Brent , he felt as if he had been suddenly transported to a new world . He was no longer Philip Brent , and the worst of it was that he did not know who he was . In his tumultuous state of feeling , however , one thing seemed clear--his prospects were wholly changed , and his plans for the future also . Mrs . Brent had told him that he was wholly dependent upon her . Well , he did not intend to remain so . His home had not been pleasant at the best . As a dependent upon the bounty of such a woman it would be worse . He resolved to leave home and strike out for himself , not from any such foolish idea of independence as sometimes leads boys to desert a good home for an uncertain skirmish with the world , but simply be cause he felt now that he had no real home .  To begin with he would need money , and on opening his pocket-book he ascertained that his available funds consisted of only a dollar and thirty-seven cents . That wasnt quite enough to begin the world with . But he had other resources . He owned a gun , which a friend of his would be ready to take off his hands . He had a boat , also , which he could probably sell .  On the village street he met Reuben Gordon , a young journeyman carpenter , who was earning good wages , and had money to spare .  How are you , Phil , said Reuben in a friendly way .  You are just the one I want to meet , said Phil earnestly . Didnt you tell me once you would like to buy my gun ?  Yes . Want to sell it ?  No , I dont; but I want the money it will bring . So Ill sell it if youll buy .  What dye want for it ? asked Reuben cautiously .  Six dollars .  Too much . Ill give five .  You can have it , said Phil after a pause . How soon can you let me have the money ?  Bring the gun round to-night , and Ill pay you for it .  All right . Do you know of any one who wants to buy a boat ?  What ? Going to sell that , too ?  Yes .  Seems to me youre closin up business ? said Reuben shrewdly .  So I am . Im going to leave Planktown .  You dont say ? Well , I declare! Where are you goin ?  To New York , I guess .  Got any prospect there ?  Yes .  This was not , perhaps , strictly true--that is , Phil had no definite prospect , but he felt that there must be a chance in a large city like New York for any one who was willing to work , and so felt measurably justified in saying what he did .  I hadnt thought of buyin a boat , said Reuben thoughtfully .  Phil pricked up his ears at the hint of a possible customer .  Youd better buy mine , he said quickly; Ill sell it cheap .  How cheap ?  Ten dollars .  Thats too much .  It cost me fifteen .  But its second-hand now , you know , said Reuben .  Its just as good as new . Im taking off five dollars , though , you see .  I dont think I want it enough to pay ten dollars .  What will you give ?  Reuben finally agreed to pay seven dollars and seventy-five cents , after more or less bargaining , and to pay the money that evening upon delivery of the goods .  I dont think Ive got anything more to sell , said Phil thoughtfully . Theres my skates , but they are not very good . Ill give them to Tommy Kavanagh . He cant afford to buy a pair .  Tommy was the son of a poor widow , and was very much pleased with the gift , which Phil conveyed to him just before supper .  Just after supper he took his gun and the key of his boat over to Reuben Gordon , who thereupon gave him the money agreed upon .  Shall I tell Mrs . Brent I am going away ? Phil said to himself , or shall I leave a note for her ?  He decided to announce his resolve in person . To do otherwise would seem too much like running away , and that he had too much self-respect to do .  So in the evening , after his return from Reuben Gordons , he said to Mrs . Brent:  I think I ought to tell you that Im going away to-morrow .  Mrs . Brent looked up from her work , and her cold gray eyes surveyed Phil with curious scrutiny .  You are going away! she replied . Where are you going ?  I think I shall go to New York .  What for ?  Seek my fortune , as so many have done before me .  They didnt always find it! said Mrs . Brent with a cold sneer . Is there any other reason ?  Yes; its chiefly on account of what you told me yesterday . You said that I was dependent upon you .  So you are .  And that I wasnt even entitled to the name of Brent .  Yes , I said it , and its true .  Well , said Phil , I dont want to be dependent upon you . I prefer to earn my own living .  I am not prepared to say but that you are right . But do you know what the neighbors will say ?  What will they say ?  That I drove you from home .  It wont be true . I dont pretend to enjoy my home , but I suppose I can stay on here if I like ?  Yes , you can stay .  You dont object to my going ?  No , if it is understood that you go of your own accord .  I am willing enough to take the blame of it , if there is any blame .  Very well; get a sheet of note-paper , and write at my direction .  Phil took a sheet of note-paper from his fathers desk , and sat down to comply with Mrs . Brents request .  She dictated as follows:  I leave home at my own wish , but with the consent of Mrs . Brent , to seek my fortune . It is wholly my own idea , and I hold no one else responsible .  PHILIP BRENT .   You may as well keep the name of Brent , said his step-mother , as you have no other that you know of .  Phil winced at those cold words . It was not pleasant to reflect that this was so , and that he was wholly ignorant of his parentage .  One thing more , said Mrs . Brent . It is only eight oclock . I should like to have you go out and call upon some of those with whom you are most intimate , and tell them that you are leaving home voluntarily .  I will , answered Phil .  Perhaps you would prefer to do so to-morrow .  No; I am going away to-morrow morning .  Very well .  Going away to-morrow morning ? repeated Jonas , who entered the room at that moment .  Phils plan was briefly disclosed .  Then give me your skates , said Jonas .  I cant . Ive given them to Tommy Kavanagh .  Thats mean . You might have thought of me first , grumbled Jonas .  I dont know why . Tommy Kavanagh is my friend and you are not .  Anyway , you can let me have your boat and gun .  I have sold them .  Thats too bad .  I dont know why you should expect them . I needed the money they brought me to pay my expenses till I get work .  I will pay your expenses to New York if you wish , said Mrs . Brent .  Thank you; but I shall have money enough , answered Phil , who shrank from receiving any favor at the hands of Mrs . Brent .  As you please , but you will do me the justice to remember that I offered it .  Thank you . I shall not forget it .  That evening , just before going to bed , Mrs . Brent opened a trunk and drew from it a folded paper .  She read as follows--for it was her husbands will:   To the boy generally known as Philip Brent , and supposed , though incorrectly , to be my son , I bequeath the sum of five thousand dollars , and direct the same to be paid over to any one whom he may select as guardian , to hold in trust for him till he attains the age of twenty-one .   He need never know of this , said Mrs . Brent to herself in a low tone . I will save it for Jonas .  She held the paper a moment , as if undecided whether to destroy it , but finally put it carefully back in the secret hiding-place from which she had taken it .  He is leaving home of his own accord , she whispered . Henceforth he will probably keep away . That suits me well , but no one can say I drove him to it .    CHAPTER IV .  MR . LIONEL LAKE .  Six months before it might have cost Philip a pang to leave home . Then his father was living , and from him the boy had never received aught but kindness . Even his step-mother , though she secretly disliked him , did not venture to show it , and secure in the affections of his supposed father , he did not trouble himself as to whether Mrs . Brent liked him or not . As for Jonas , he was cautioned by his mother not to get himself into trouble by treating Phil badly , and the boy , who knew on which side his interests lay , faithfully obeyed . It was only after the death of Mr . Brent that both Jonas and his mother changed their course , and thought it safe to snub Philip .  Planktown was seventy-five miles distant from New York , and the fare was two dollars and a quarter .  This was rather a large sum to pay , considering Phils scanty fund , but he wished to get to the great city as soon as possible , and he decided that it would be actually cheaper to ride than to walk , considering that he would have to buy his meals on the way .  He took his seat in the cars , placing a valise full of underclothes on the seat next him . The train was not very full , and the seat beside him did not appear to be required .  Mile after mile they sped on the way , and Phil looked from the window with interest at the towns through which they passed . There are very few boys of his age--sixteen--who do not like to travel in the cars . Limited as were his means , and uncertain as were his prospects , Phil felt not only cheerful , but actually buoyant , as every minute took him farther away from Planktown , and so nearer the city where he hoped to make a living at the outset , and perhaps his fortune in the end .  Presently--perhaps half way on--a young man , rather stylishly dressed , came into the car . It was not at a station , and therefore it seemed clear that he came from another car .  He halted when he reached the seat which Phil occupied .  Our hero , observing that his glance rested on his valise , politely removed it , saying:  Would you like to sit down here , sir ?  Yes , thank you , answered the young man , and sank into the seat beside Phil .  Sorry to inconvenience you , he said , with a glance at the bag .  Oh , not at all , returned Phil . I only put the valise on the seat till it was wanted by some passenger .  You are more considerate than some passengers , observed the young man . In the next car is a woman , an elderly party , who is taking up three extra seats to accommodate her bags and boxes .  That seems rather selfish , remarked Phil .  Selfish! I should say so . I paused a minute at her seat as I passed along , and she was terribly afraid I wanted to sit down . She didnt offer to move anything , though , as you have . I stopped long enough to make her feel uncomfortable , and then passed on . I dont think I have fared any the worse for doing so . I would rather sit beside you than her .  Am I to consider that a compliment ? asked Phil , smiling .  Well , yes , if you choose . Not that it is saying much to call you more agreeable company than the old party alluded to . Are you going to New York ?  Yes , sir .  Live there ?  I expect to live there .  Brought up in the country , perhaps ?  Yes , in Planktown .  Oh , Planktown! Ive heard its a nice place , but never visited it . Got any folks ?  Phil hesitated . In the light of the revelation that had been made to him by Mrs . Brent , he did not know how to answer . However , there was no call to answer definitely .  Not many , he said .  Goin to school in New York ?  No .  To college , perhaps . Ive got a cousin in Columbia College .  I wish I knew enough to go to college , said Phil; but I only know a little Latin , and no Greek at all .  Well , I never cared much about Latin or Greek , myself . I presume you are thinking about a business position ?  Yes , I shall try to get a place .  You may find a little time necessary to find one . However , you are , no doubt , able to pay your board for awhile .  For a short time , said Phil .  Well , I may be able to help you to a place . I know a good many prominent business men .  I should be grateful to you for any help of that kind , said Phil , deciding that he was in luck to meet with such a friend .  Dont mention it . I have had to struggle myself--in earlier days--though at present I am well fixed . What is your name ?  Philip Brent .  Good! My name is Lionel Lake . Sorry I havent got any cards . Perhaps I may have one in my pocket-book . Let me see!  Mr . Lake opened his porte-monnaie and uttered a exclamation of surprise .  By Jove! he said , I am in a fix .  Phil looked at him inquiringly .  I took out a roll of bills at the house of my aunt , where I stayed last night , explained Mr . Lake , and must have neglected to replace them .  I hope you have not lost them , said Phil politely .  Oh , no; my aunt will find them and take care of them for me , so that I shall get them back . The trouble is that I am left temporarily without funds .  But you can get money in the city , suggested Phil .  No doubt; only it is necessary for me to stay over a train ten miles short of the city .  Mr . Lionel Lake seemed very much perplexed .  If I knew some one in the cars , he said reflectively .  It did occur to Phil to offer to loan him something , but the scantiness of his own resources warned him that it would not be prudent , so he remained silent .  Finally Mr . Lake appeared to have an idea .  Have you got five dollars , Philip ? he said familiarly .  Yes , sir , answered Philip slowly .  Then Ill make a proposal . Lend it to me and I will give you this ring as security . It is worth twenty-five dollars easily .  He drew from his vest-pocket a neat gold ring , with some sort of a stone in the setting .  There! said Mr . Lake , Ill give you this ring and my address , and you can bring it to my office to-morrow morning . Ill give you back the five dollars and one dollar for the accommodation . Thats good interest , isnt it ?  But I might keep the ring and sell it , suggested Phil .  Oh , I am not afraid . You look honest . I will trust you , said the young man , in a careless , off-hand manner . Say , is it a bargain ?  Yes , answered Phil .  It occurred to him that he could not earn a dollar more easily . Besides , he would be doing a favor to this very polite young man .  All right , then!  Five dollars of Phils scanty hoard was handed to Mr . Lake , who , in return , gave Phil the ring , which he put on his finger .  He also handed Phil a scrap of paper , on which he penciled:   LIONEL LAKE , No . 237 Broadway .   Im ever so much obliged , he said . Good-by . I get out at the next station .  Phil was congratulating himself on his good stroke of business , when the conductor entered the car , followed by a young lady . When they came to where Phil was seated , the young lady said:  That is my ring on that boys finger ?  Aha! weve found the thief , then! said the conductor . Boy , give up the ring you stole from this young lady!  As he spoke he placed his hand on Phils shoulder .  Stole! repeated Phil , gasping . I dont understand you .  Oh , yes , you do! said the conductor roughly .    CHAPTER V .  AN OVERBEARING CONDUCTOR  No matter how honest a boy may be , a sudden charge of theft is likely to make him look confused and guilty .  Such was the case with Phil .  I assure you , he said earnestly , that I did not steal this ring .  Where did you get it , then ? demanded the conductor roughly .  He was one of those men who , in any position , will make themselves disagreeable . Moreover , he was a man who always thought ill of others , when there was any chance of doing so . In fact , he preferred to credit his fellows with bad qualities rather than with good .  It was handed me by a young man who just left the car , said Phil .  Thats a likely story , sneered the conductor .  Young men are not in the habit of giving valuable rings to strangers .  He did not give it to me , I advanced him five dollars on it .  What was the young mans name ? asked the conductor incredulously .  Theres his name and address , answered Phil , drawing from his pocket the paper handed him by Mr . Lake .  Lionel Lake , 237 Broadway , repeated the conductor . If there is any such person , which I very much doubt , you are probably a confederate of his .  You have no right to say this , returned Phil indignantly .  I havent , havent I ? snapped the conductor .  Do you know what I am going to do with you ?  If you wish me to return the ring to this young lady , I will do so , if she is positive it is hers .  Yes , you must do that , but it wont get you out of trouble . I shall hand you over to a policeman as soon as we reach New York .  Phil was certainly dismayed , for he felt that it might be difficult for him to prove that he came honestly in possession of the ring .  The fact is , added the conductor , your story is too thin .  Conductor , said a new voice , you are doing the boy an injustice .  The speaker was an old man with gray hair , but of form still robust , though he was at least sixty five . He sat in the seat just behind Phil .  Thank you , sir , said Phil gratefully .  I understand my business , said the conductor impertinently , and dont need any instructions from you .  Young man , said the old gentleman , in a very dignified tone , I have usually found officials of your class polite and gentlemanly , but you are an exception .  Who are you ? asked the conductor rudely . What right have you to put in your oar ?  As to who I am , I will answer you by and by . In reference to the boy , I have to say that his story is correct . I heard the whole conversation between him and the young man from whom he received the ring , and I can testify that he has told the truth .  At any rate he has received stolen property .  Not knowing it to be stolen . The young man was an entire stranger to him , and though I suspected that he was an unscrupulous adventurer , the boy has not had experience enough to judge men .  Very well . If hes innocent he can prove it when hes brought to trial , said the conductor . As for you , sir , its none of your business .  Young man , you asked me a short time since who I am . Do you want to know ?  I am not very particular .  Then , sir , I have to inform you that I am Richard Grant , the president of this road .  The conductors face was a curious and interesting study when he heard this announcement . He knew that the old man whom he had insulted had a right to discharge him from his position , and bully as he had shown himself , he was now inclined to humble himself to save his place .  I beg your pardon , sir , he said in a composed tone . If I had known who you were I wouldnt have spoken as I did .  I had a claim to be treated like a gentleman , even if I had no connection with the road , he said .  If you say the boys all right , I wont interfere with him , continued the conductor .  My testimony would clear him from any charge that might be brought against him , said the president . I saw him enter the car , and know he has had no opportunity to take the ring .  If hell give me back the ring , thats all I want , said the young lady .  That I am willing to do , though I lose five dollars by it , said Philip .  Do so , my boy , said the president . I take it for granted that the young ladys claim is a just one .  Upon this Philip drew the ring from his finger and handed it to the young lady , who went back to the car where her friends were sitting .  I hope , sir , said the conductor anxiously , that you wont be prejudiced against me on account of this affair .  I am sorry to say that I cant help feeling prejudiced against you , returned the president dryly; but I wont allow this feeling to injure you if , upon inquiring , I find that you are otherwise an efficient officer .  Thank you , sir .  I am glad that my presence has saved this boy from being the victim of an injustice . Let this be a lesson to you in future .  The conductor walked away , looking quite chop-fallen , and Philip turned to his new friend .  I am very much indebted to you , sir , he said . But for you I should have found myself in serious trouble .  I am glad to have prevented an injustice , my lad . I am sorry I could not save you from loss also . That enterprising rogue has gone off with five dollars belonging to you . I hope the loss will not be a serious one to you .  It was more than a third part of my capital , sir , said Phil , rather ruefully .  I am sorry for that . I suppose , however , you are not dependent upon your own resources ?  Yes , sir , I am .  Have you no parents , then ? asked Mr . Grant , with interest .  No , sir; that is , I have a step-mother .  And what are your plans , if you are willing to tell me ?  I am going to New York to try to make a living .  I cannot commend your plan , my young friend , unless there is a good reason for it .   I think there is a good reason for it , sir .  I hope you have not run away from home ?  No , sir; I left home with my step-mothers knowledge and consent .  That is well . I dont want wholly to discourage you , and so I will tell you that I , too , came to New York at your age with the same object in view , with less money in my pocket than you possess .  And now you are the president of a railroad! said Phil hopefully .  Yes; but I had a hard struggle before I reached that position .  I am not afraid of hard work , sir .  That is in your favor . Perhaps you may be as lucky as I have been . You may call at my office in the city , if you feel inclined .  As Mr . Grant spoke he put in Phils hand a card bearing his name and address , in Wall Street .  Thank you , sir , said Phil gratefully . I shall be glad to call . I may need advice .  If you seek advice and follow it you will be an exception to the general rule , said the president , smiling . One thing more--you have met with a loss which , to you , is a serious one . Allow me to bear it , and accept this bill .  But , sir , it is not right that you should bear it , commenced Phil . Then , looking at the bill , he said: Havent you made a mistake ? This is a TEN-dollar bill .  I know it . Accept the other five as an evidence of my interest in you . By the way , I go to Philadelphia and Washington before my return to New York , and shall not return for three or four days . After that time you will find me at my office .  I am in luck after all , thought Phil cheerfully , in spite of the mean trick of Mr . Lionel Lake .    CHAPTER VI .  SIGNOR ORLANDO .  So Phil reached New York in very fair spirits . He found himself , thanks to the liberality of Mr . Grant , in a better financial position than when he left home .  As he left the depot and found himself in the streets of New York , he felt like a stranger upon the threshold of a new life . He knew almost nothing about the great city he had entered , and was at a loss where to seek for lodgings .  Its a cold day , said a sociable voice at his elbow .  Looking around , Phil saw that the speaker was a sallow-complexioned young man , with black hair and mustache , a loose black felt hat , crushed at the crown , giving him rather a rakish look .  Yes , sir , answered Phil politely .  Stranger in the city , I expect ?  Yes , sir .  Never mind the sir . I aint used to ceremony . I am Signor Orlando .  Signor Orlando! repeated Phil , rather puzzled .  Are you an Italian ?  Well , yes , returned Signor Orlando , with a wink , thats what I am , or what people think me; but I was born in Vermont , and am half Irish and half Yankee .  How did you come by your name , then ?  I took it , answered his companion . You see , dear boy , Im a professional .  A what ?  A professional--singer and clog-dancer . I believe I am pretty well known to the public , continued Signor Orlando complacently . Last summer I traveled with Jenks & Browns circus . Of course youve heard of THEM . Through the winter I am employed at Bowermans Varieties , in the Bowery . I appear every night , and at two matinees weekly .  It must be confessed that Phil was considerably impressed by the professional character of Signor Orlando . He had never met an actor , or public performer of any description , and was disposed to have a high respect for a man who filled such a conspicuous position . There was not , to be sure , anything very impressive about Signor Orlandos appearance . His face did not indicate talent , and his dress was shabby . But for all that he was a man familiar with the public--a man of gifts .  I should like to see you on the stage , said Phil respectfully .  So you shall , my dear boy--so you shall . Ill get you a pass from Mr . Bowerman . Which way are you going ?  I dont know , answered Phil , puzzled . I should like to find a cheap boarding-house , but I dont know the city .  I do , answered Signor Orlando promptly . Why not come to my house ?  Have you a house ?  I mean my boarding-house . Its some distance away . Suppose we take a horse-car ?  All right! answered Phil , relieved to find a guide in the labyrinth of the great city .  I live on Fifth Street , near the Bowery--a very convenient location , said Orlando , if we may take the liberty to call him thus .  Fifth Avenue ? asked Phil , who did not know the difference .  Oh , no; thats a peg above my style . I am not a Vanderbilt , nor yet an Astor .  Is the price moderate ? asked Phil anxiously . I must make my money last as long as I can , for I dont know when I shall get a place .  To be sure . You might room with me , only Ive got a hall bedroom . Perhaps we might manage it , though .  I think I should prefer a room by myself , said Phil , who reflected that Signor Orlando was a stranger as yet .  Oh , well , Ill speak to the old lady , and I guess she can accommodate you with a hall bedroom like mine on the third floor .  What should I have to pay ?  A dollar and a quarter a week , and you can get your meals where you please .  I think that will suit me , said Phil thoughtfully .  After leaving the car , a minutes walk brought them to a shabby three-story house of brick . There was a stable opposite , and a group of dirty children were playing in front of it .  This is where I hang out , said Signor Orlando cheerfully . As the poet says , there is no place like home .  If this had been true it was not much to be regretted , since the home in question was far from attractive .  Signor Orlando rang the bell , and a stout woman of German aspect answered the call .  So you haf come back , Herr Orlando , said this lady . I hope you haf brought them two weeks rent you owe me .  All in good time , Mrs . Schlessinger , said Orlando . But you see I have brought some one with me .  Is he your bruder now ? asked the lady .  No , he is not , unfortunately for me . His name is----  Orlando coughed .  Philip Brent , suggested our hero .  Just so--Philip Brent .  I am glad to see Mr . Prent , said the landlady .  And is he an actor like you , Signor Orlando ?  Not yet . We dont know what may happen . But he comes on business , Mrs . Schlessinger . He wants a room .  The landlady brightened up . She had two rooms vacant , and a new lodger was a godsend .  I vill show Mr . Prent what rooms I haf , she said . Come up-stairs , Mr . Prent .  The good woman toiled up the staircase panting , for she was asthmatic , and Phil followed . The interior of the house was as dingy as the exterior , and it was quite dark on the second landing .  She threw open the door of a back room , which , being lower than the hall , was reached by a step .  There! said she , pointing to the faded carpet , rumpled bed , and cheap pine bureau , with the little six-by-ten looking-glass surmounting it . This is a peautiful room for a single gentleman , or even for a man and his wife .  My friend , Mr . Brent , is not married , said Signor Orlando waggishly .  Phil laughed .  You will have your shoke , Signor Orlando , said Mrs . Schlessinger .  What is the price of this room ? asked Phil .  Three dollars a week , Mr . Prent , I ought to have four , but since you are a steady young gentleman----  How does she know that ? Phil wondered .  Since you are a steady young gentleman , and a friend of Signor Orlando , I will not ask you full price .  That is more than I can afford to pay , said Phil , shaking his head .  I think you had better show Mr . Brent the hall bedroom over mine , suggested the signor .  Mrs . Schlessinger toiled up another staircase , the two new acquaintances following her . She threw open the door of one of those depressing cells known in New York as a hall bedroom . It was about five feet wide and eight feet long , and was nearly filled up by a cheap bedstead , covered by a bed about two inches thick , and surmounted at the head by a consumptive-looking pillow . The paper was torn from the walls in places . There was one rickety chair , and a wash-stand which bore marks of extreme antiquity .  This is a very neat room for a single gentleman , remarked Mrs . Schlessinger .  Phils spirits fell as he surveyed what was to be his future home . It was a sad contrast to his neat , comfortable room at home .  Is this room like yours , Signor Orlando ? he asked faintly .  As like as two peas , answered Orlando .  Would you recommend me to take it ?  You couldnt do better .  How could the signor answer otherwise in presence of a landlady to whom he owed two weeks rent ?  Then , said Phil , with a secret shudder , Ill take it if the rent is satisfactory .  A dollar and a quarter a week , said Mrs . Schlessinger promptly .  Ill take it for a week .  You wont mind paying in advance ? suggested the landlady . I pay my own rent in advance .  Phils answer was to draw a dollar and a quarter from his purse and pass it to his landlady .  Ill take possession now , said our hero . Can I have some water to wash my face ?  Mrs . Schlessinger was evidently surprised that any one should want to wash in the middle of the day , but made no objections .  When Phil had washed his face and hands , he went out with Signor Orlando to dine at a restaurant on the Bowery .    CHAPTER VII .  BOWERMANS VARIETIES .  The restaurant to which he was taken by Signor Orlando was thronged with patrons , for it was one oclock . On the whole , they did not appear to belong to the highest social rank , though they were doubtless respectable . The table-cloths were generally soiled , and the waiters had a greasy look . Phil said nothing , but he did not feel quite so hungry as before he entered .  The signor found two places at one of the tables , and they sat down . Phil examined a greasy bill of fare and found that he could obtain a plate of meat for ten cents . This included bread and butter , and a dish of mashed potato . A cup of tea would be five cents additional .  I can afford fifteen cents for a meal , he thought , and called for a plate of roast beef .  Corn beef and cabbage for me , said the signor .  Its very filling , he remarked aside to Phil .  They wont give you but a mouthful of beef .  So it proved , but the quality was such that Phil did not care for more . He ordered a piece of apple pie afterward feeling still hungry .   I see youre bound to have a square meal , said the signor .  After Phil had had it , he was bound to confess that he did not feel uncomfortably full . Yet he had spent twice as much as the signor , who dispensed with the tea and pie as superfluous luxuries .  In the evening Signor Orlando bent his steps toward Bowermans Varieties .  I hope in a day or two to get a complimentary ticket for you , Mr . Brent , he said .  How much is the ticket ? asked Phil .  Fifteen cents . Best reserved seats twenty-five cents .  I believe I will be extravagant for once , said Phil , and go at my own expense .  Good! said the signor huskily . Youll feel repaid Ill be bound . Bowerman always gives the public their moneys worth . The performance begins at eight oclock and wont be out until half-past eleven .  Less than five cents an hour , commented Phil .  What a splendid head youve got! said Signor Orlando admiringly . I couldnt have worked that up . Figures aint my province .  It seemed to Phil rather a slender cause for compliment , but he said nothing , since it seemed clear that the computation was beyond his companions ability .  As to the performance , it was not refined , nor was the talent employed first-class . Still Phil enjoyed himself after a fashion . He had never had it in his power to attend many amusements , and this was new to him . He naturally looked with interest for the appearance of his new friend and fellow-lodger .  Signor Orlando appeared , dressed in gorgeous array , sang a song which did credit to the loudness of his voice rather than its quality , and ended by a noisy clog-dance which elicited much applause from the boys in the gallery , who shared the evenings entertainment for the moderate sum of ten cents .  The signor was called back to the stage . He bowed his thanks and gave another dance . Then he was permitted to retire . As this finished his part of the entertainment he afterward came around in citizens dress , and took a seat in the auditorium beside Phil .  How did you like me , Mr . Brent ? he asked complacently .  I thought you did well , Signor Orlando . You were much applauded .  Yes , the audience is very loyal , said the proud performer .  Two half-grown boys heard Phil pronounce the name of his companion , and they gazed awe-stricken at the famous man .  Thats Signor Orlando! whispered one of the others .  I know it , was the reply .  Such is fame , said the Signor , in a pleased tone to Phil . People point me out on the streets .  Very gratifying , no doubt , said our hero , but it occurred to him that he would not care to be pointed out as a performer at Bowermans . Signor Orlando , however , well-pleased with himself , didnt doubt that Phil was impressed by his popularity , and perhaps even envied it .  They didnt stay till the entertainment was over . It was , of course , familiar to the signor , and Phil felt tired and sleepy , for he had passed a part of the afternoon in exploring the city , and had walked in all several miles .  He went back to his lodging-house , opened the door with a pass-key which Mrs . Schlessinger had given him , and climbing to his room in the third story , undressed and deposited himself in bed .  The bed was far from luxurious . A thin pallet rested on slats , so thin that he could feel the slats through it , and the covering was insufficient . The latter deficiency he made up by throwing his overcoat over the quilt , and despite the hardness of his bed , he was soon sleeping soundly .  To-morrow I must look for a place , he said to Signor Orlando . Can you give me any advise ?  Yes , my dear boy . Buy a daily paper , the Sun or Herald , and look at the advertisements . There may be some prominent business man who is looking out for a boy of your size .  Phil knew of no better way , and he followed Signor Orlandos advice .  After a frugal breakfast at the Bowery restaurant , he invested a few pennies in the two papers mentioned , and began to go the rounds .  The first place was in Pearl Street .  He entered , and was directed to a desk in the front part of the store .  You advertised for a boy , he said .  Weve got one , was the brusque reply .  Of course no more was to be said , and Phil walked out , a little dashed at his first rebuff .  At the next place he found some half a dozen boys waiting , and joined the line , but the vacancy was filled before his turn came .  At the next place his appearance seemed to make a good impression , and he was asked several questions .  What is your name ?  Philip Brent .  How old are you ?  Just sixteen .  How is your education ?  I have been to school since I was six .  Then you ought to know something . Have you ever been in a place ?  No , sir .  Do you live with your parents ?  No , sir; I have just come to the city , and am lodging in Fifth Street .  Then you wont do . We wish our boys to live with their parents .  Poor Phil! He had allowed himself to hope that at length he was likely to get a place . The abrupt termination of the conversation dispirited him .  He made three more applications . In one of them he again came near succeeding , but once more the fact that he did not live with his parents defeated his application .  It seems to be very hard getting a place , thought Phil , and it must be confessed he felt a little homesick .  I wont make any more applications to-day , he decided , and being on Broadway , walked up that busy thoroughfare , wondering what the morrow would bring forth .  It was winter , and there was ice on the sidewalk . Directly in front of Phil walked an elderly gentleman , whose suit of fine broadcloth and gold spectacles , seemed to indicate a person of some prominence and social importance .  Suddenly he set foot on a treacherous piece of ice . Vainly he strove to keep his equilibrium , his arms waving wildly , and his gold-headed cane falling to the sidewalk . He would have fallen backward , had not Phil , observing his danger in time , rushed to his assistance .    CHAPTER VIII .  THE HOUSE IN TWELFTH STREET .  With some difficulty the gentleman righted himself , and then Phil picked up his cane .  I hope you are not hurt , sir ? he said .  I should have been but for you , my good boy , said the gentleman . I am a little shaken by the suddenness of my slipping .  Would you wish me to go with you , sir ?  Yes , if you please . I do not perhaps require you , but I shall be glad of your company .  Thank you , sir .  Do you live in the city ?  Yes , sir; that is , I propose to do so . I have come here in search of employment .  Phil said this , thinking it possible that the old gentleman might exert his influence in his favor .  Are you dependent on what you may earn ? asked the gentleman , regarding him attentively .  I have a little money , sir , but when that is gone I shall need to earn something .  That is no misfortune . It is a good thing for a boy to be employed . Otherwise he is liable to get into mischief .  At any rate , I shall be glad to find work , sir .  Have you applied anywhere yet ?  Phil gave a little account of his unsuccessful applications , and the objections that had been made to him .  Yes , yes , said the old gentleman thoughtfully , more confidence is placed in a boy who lives with his parents .  The two walked on together until they reached Twelfth Street . It was a considerable walk , and Phil was surprised that his companion should walk , when he could easily have taken a Broadway stage , but the old gentleman explained this himself .  I find it does me good , he said , to spend some time in the open air , and even if walking tires me it does me good .  At Twelfth Street they turned off .  I am living with a married niece , he said , just on the other side of Fifth Avenue .  At the door of a handsome four-story house , with a brown-stone front , the old gentleman paused , and told Phil that this was his residence .  Then , sir , I will bid you good-morning , said Phil .  No , no; come in and lunch with me , said Mr . Carter hospitably .  He had , by the way , mentioned that his name was Oliver Carter , and that he was no longer actively engaged in business , but was a silent partner in the firm of which his nephew by marriage was the nominal head .  Thank you , sir , answered Phil .  He was sure that the invitation was intended to be accepted , and he saw no reason why he should not accept it .  Hannah , said the old gentleman to the servant who opened the door , tell your mistress that I have brought a boy home to dinner with me .  Yes , sir , answered Hannah , surveying Phil in some surprise .  Come up to my room , my young friend , said Mr . Carter . You may want to prepare for lunch .  Mr . Carter had two connecting rooms on the second floor , one of which he used as a bed-chamber . The furniture was handsome and costly , and Phil , who was not used to city houses , thought it luxurious .  Phil washed his face and hands , and brushed his hair . Then a bell rang , and following his new friend , he went down to lunch .  Lunch was set out in the front basement . When Phil and Mr . Carter entered the room a lady was standing by the fire , and beside her was a boy of about Phils age . The lady was tall and slender , with light-brown hair and cold gray eyes .  Lavinia , said Mr . Carter , I have brought a young friend with me to lunch .  So I see , answered the lady . Has he been here before ?  No; he is a new acquaintance .  I would speak to him if I knew his name .  His name is----  Here the old gentleman hesitated , for in truth he had forgotten .  Philip Brent .  You may sit down here , Mr . Brent , said Mrs . Pitkin , for this was the ladys name .  Thank you , maam .  And so you made my uncles acquaintance this morning ? she continued , herself taking a seat at the head of the table .  Yes; he was of service to me , answered Mr . Carter for him . I had lost my balance , and should have had a heavy fall if Philip had not come to my assistance .  He was very kind , I am sure , said Mrs . Pitkin , but her tone was very cold .  Philip , said Mr . Carter , this is my grand-nephew , Alonzo Pitkin .  He indicated the boy already referred to .  How do you do ? said Alonzo , staring at Philip not very cordially .  Very well , thank you , answered Philip politely .  Where do you live ? asked Alonzo , after a moments hesitation .  In Fifth Street .  Thats near the Bowery , isnt it ?  Yes .  The boy shrugged his shoulders and exchanged a significant look with his mother .  Fifth Street was not a fashionable street--indeed quite the reverse , and Phils answer showed that he was a nobody . Phil himself had begun to suspect that he was unfashionably located , but he felt that until his circumstances improved he might as well remain where he was .  But , though he lived in an unfashionable street , it could not be said that Phil , in his table manners , showed any lack of good breeding . He seemed quite at home at Mrs . Pitkins table , and in fact acted with greater propriety than Alonzo , who was addicted to fast eating and greediness .  Couldnt you walk home alone , Uncle Oliver ? asked Mrs . Pitkin presently .  Yes .  Then it was a pity to trouble Mr . Brent to come with you .  It was no trouble , responded Philip promptly , though he suspected that it was not consideration for him that prompted the remark .  Yes , I admit that I was a little selfish in taking up my young friends time , said the old gentleman cheerfully; but I infer , from what he tells me , that it is not particularly valuable just now .  Are you in a business position , Mr . Brent ? asked Mrs . Pitkin .  No , madam . I was looking for a place this morning .  Have you lived for some time in the city ?  No; I came here only yesterday from the country .  I think country boys are very foolish to leave good homes in the country to seek places in the city , said Mrs . Pitkin sharply .  There may be circumstances , Lavinia , that make it advisable , suggested Mr . Carter , who , however , did not know Phils reason for coming .  No doubt; I understand that , answered Mrs . Pitkin , in a tone so significant that Phil wondered whether she thought he had got into any trouble at home .  And besides , we cant judge for every one . So I hope Master Philip may find some good and satisfactory opening , now that he has reached the city .  After a short time , lunch , which in New York is generally a plain meal , was over , and Mr . Carter invited Philip to come up-stairs again .  I want to talk over your prospects , Philip , he said .  There was silence till after the two had left the room . Then Mrs . Pitkin said:  Alonzo , I dont like this .  What dont you like , ma ?  Uncle bringing this boy home . It is very extraordinary , this sudden interest in a perfect stranger .  Do you think hell leave him any money ? asked Alonzo , betraying interest .  I dont know what it may lead to , Lonny , but it dont look right . Such things have been known .  Id like to punch the boys head , remarked Alonzo , with sudden hostility . All uncles money ought to come to us .  So it ought , by rights , observed his mother .  We must see that this boy doesnt get any ascendency over him .  Phil would have been very much amazed if he had overheard this conversation .    CHAPTER IX .  THE OLD GENTLEMAN PROVES A FRIEND .  The old gentleman sat down in an arm-chair and waved his hand toward a small rocking-chair , in which Phil seated himself .  I conclude that you had a good reason for leaving home , Philip , said Mr . Carter , eying our hero with a keen , but friendly look .  Yes , sir; since my fathers death it has not been a home to me .  Is there a step-mother in the case ? asked the old gentleman shrewdly .  Yes , sir .  Any one else ?  She has a son .  And you two dont agree ?  You seem to know all about it , sir , said Phil , surprised .  I know something of the world--that is all .  Phil began to think that Mr . Carters knowledge of the world was very remarkable . He began to wonder whether he could know anything more--could suspect the secret which Mrs . Brent had communicated to him . Should he speak of it ? He decided at any rate to wait , for Mr . Carter , though kind , was a comparative stranger .  Well , continued the old gentleman , I wont inquire too minutely into the circumstances . You dont look like a boy that would take such an important step as leaving home without a satisfactory reason . The next thing is to help you .  Phils courage rose as he heard these words . Mr . Carter was evidently a rich man , and he could help him if he was willing . So he kept silence , and let his new friend do the talking .  You want a place , continued Mr . Carter . Now , what are you fit for ?  That is a hard question for me to answer , sir . I dont know .  Have you a good education ?  Yes , sir; and I know something of Latin and French besides .  You can write a good hand ?  Shall I show you , sir ?  Yes; write a few lines at my private desk .  Phil did so , and handed the paper to Mr . Carter .  Very good , said the old gentleman approvingly .  That is in your favor . Are you good at accounts ?  Yes , sir .  Better still .  Sit down there again , he continued . I will give you a sum in interest .  Phil resumed his seat .  What is the interest of eight hundred and forty-five dollars and sixty cents for four years , three months and twelve days , at eight and one-half per cent ?  Phils pen moved fast in perfect silence for five minutes . Then he announced the result .  Let me look at the paper . I will soon tell you whether it is correct .  After a brief examination , for the old gentleman was himself an adept at figures , he said , with a beaming smile:  It is entirely correct . You are a smart boy .  Thank you , sir , said Phil , gratified .  And you deserve a good place--better than you will probably get .  Phil listened attentively . The last clause was not quite so satisfactory .  Yes , said Mr . Carter , evidently talking to himself , I must get Pitkin to take him .  Phil knew that the lady whom he had already met was named Pitkin , and he rightly concluded that it was her husband who was meant .  I hope he is more agreeable than his wife , thought Philip .  Yes , Philip , said Mr . Carter , who had evidently made up his mind , I will try to find you a place this afternoon .  I shall be very much obliged , sir , said Philip gladly .  I have already told you that my nephew and I are in business together , he being the active and I the silent partner . We do a general shipping business . Our store is on Franklin Street . I will give you a letter to my nephew and he will give you a place .  Thank you , sir .  Wait a minute and I will write the note .  Five minutes later Phil was on his way down town with his credentials in his pocket .    CHAPTER X .  Phil CALLS ON MR . PITKIN .  PHIL paused before an imposing business structure , and looked up to see if he could see the sign that would show him he had reached his destination .  He had not far to look . On the front of the building he saw in large letters the sign:  ENOCH PITKIN & CO .   In the door-way there was another sign , from which he learned that the firm occupied the second floor .  He went up-stairs , and opening a door , entered a spacious apartment which looked like a hive of industry . There were numerous clerks , counters piled with goods , and every indication that a prosperous business was being carried on .  The nearest person was a young man of eighteen , or perhaps more , with an incipient , straw-colored mustache , and a shock of hair of tow-color . This young man wore a variegated neck-tie , a stiff standing-collar , and a suit of clothes in the extreme of fashion .  Phil looked at him hesitatingly .  The young man observed the look , and asked condescendingly:  What can I do for you , my son ?  Such an address from a person less than three years older than himself came near upsetting the gravity of Phil .  Is Mr . Pitkin in ? he asked .  Yes , I believe so .  Can I see him .  I have no objection , remarked the young man facetiously .  Where shall I find him ?  The youth indicated a small room partitioned off as a private office in the extreme end of the store .  Thank you , said Phil , and proceeded to find his way to the office in question .  Arrived at the door , which was partly open , he looked in .  In an arm-chair sat a small man , with an erect figure and an air of consequence . He was not over forty-five , but looked older , for his cheeks were already seamed and his look was querulous . Cheerful natures do not so soon show signs of age as their opposites .  Mr . Pitkin ? said Phil interrogatively .  Well ? said the small man , frowning instinctively .  I have a note for you , sir .  Phil stepped forward and handed the missive to Mr . Pitkin .  The latter opened it quickly and read as follows:   The boy who will present this to you did me a service this morning . He is in want of employment . He seems well educated , but if you cant offer him anything better than the post of errand boy , do so . I will guarantee that he will give satisfaction . You can send him to the post-office , and to other offices on such errands as you may have . Pay him five dollars a week and charge that sum to me . Yours truly , OLIVER CARTER .   Mr . Pitkins frown deepened as he read this note .  Pish! he ejaculated , in a tone which , though low , was audible to Phil . Uncle Oliver must be crazy . What is your name ? he demanded fiercely , turning suddenly to Phil .  Philip Brent .  When did you meet--the gentleman who gave you this letter ?  Phil told him .  Do you know what is in this letter ?  I suppose , sir , it is a request that you give me a place .  Did you read it ?  No , answered Phil indignantly .  Humph! He wants me to give you the place of errand boy .  I will try to suit you , sir .  When do you want to begin ?  As soon as possible , sir .  Come to-morrow morning , and report to me first .  Another freak of Uncle Olivers! he muttered , as he turned his back upon Phil , and so signified that the interview was at an end .    CHAPTER XI .  PHIL ENTERS UPON HIS DUTIES .  Phil presented himself in good season the next morning at the store in Franklin Street . As he came up in one direction the youth whom he had seen in the store the previous day came up in the opposite direction . The latter was evidently surprised .  Halloo , Johnny! said he . Whats brought you here again ?  Business , answered Phil .  Going to buy out the firm ? inquired the youth jocosely .  Not to-day .  Some other day , then , said the young man , laughing as if he had said a very witty thing .  As Phil didnt know that this form of expression , slightly varied , had become a popular phrase of the day , he did not laugh .  Do you belong to the church ? asked the youth , stopping short in his own mirth .  What makes you ask ?  Because you dont laugh .  I would if I saw anything to laugh at .  Come , thats hard on me . Honor bright , have you come to do any business with us ?  It is rather amusing to see how soon the cheapest clerk talks of us , quietly identifying himself with the firm that employs him . Not that I object to it . Often it implies a personal interest in the success and prosperity of the firm , which makes a clerk more valuable . This was not , however , the case with G . Washington Wilbur , the young man who was now conversing with Phil , as will presently appear .  I am going to work here , answered Phil simply .  Going to work here! repeated Mr . Wilbur in surprise . Has old Pitkin engaged you ?  Mr . Pitkin engaged me yesterday , Phil replied .  I didnt know he wanted a boy . What are you to do ?  Go to the post-office , bank , and so on .  Youre to be errand boy , then ?  Yes .  Thats the way I started , said Mr . Wilbur patronizingly .  What are you now ?  A salesman . I wouldnt like to be back in my old position . What wages are you going to get ?  Five dollars .  Five dollars a week! ejaculated Mr . G . Washington Wilbur , in amazement . Come , youre chaffing .  Why should I do that ? Is that anything remarkable ?  I should say it was , answered Mr . Wilbur slowly .  Didnt you get as much when you were errand boy ?  I only got two dollars and a half . Did Pitkin tell you he would pay you five dollars a week .  No; Mr Carter told me so .  The old gentleman--Mr . Pitkins uncle ?  Yes . It was at his request that Mr . Pitkin took me on .  Mr . Wilbur looked grave .  Its a shame! he commenced .  What is a shame; that I should get five dollars a week ?  No , but that I should only get a dollar a week more than an errand boy . Im worth every cent of ten dollars a week , but the old man only gives me six . It hardly keeps me in gloves and cigars .  Wont he give you any more ?  No; only last month I asked him for a raise , and he told me if I wasnt satisfied I might go elsewhere .  You didnt ?  No , but I mean to soon . I will show old Pitkin that he cant keep a man of my experience for such a paltry salary . I dare say that Denning or Claflin would be glad to have me , and pay me what I am worth .  Phil did not want to laugh , but when Mr . Wilbur , who looked scarcely older than himself , and was in appearance but a callow youth , referred to himself as a man of experience he found it hard to resist .  Hadnt we better be going up stairs ? asked Phil .  All right . Follow me , said Mr . Wilbur , and Ill take you to the superintendent of the room .  I am to report to Mr . Pitkin himself , I believe .  He wont be here yet awhile , said Wilbur .  But just then up came Mr . Wilbur himself , fully half an hour earlier than usual .  Phil touched his hat politely , and said:  Good-morning .  Good-morning! returned his employer , regarding him sharply . Are you the boy I hired yesterday ?  Yes , sir .  Come up-stairs , then .  Phil followed Mr . Pitkin up-stairs , and they walked together through the sales-room .  I hope you understand , said Mr . Pitkin brusquely , that I have engaged you at the request of Mr . Carter and to oblige him .  I feel grateful to Mr . Carter , said Phil , not quite knowing what was coming next .  I shouldnt myself have engaged a boy of whom I knew nothing , and who could give me no city references .  I hope you wont be disappointed in me , said Phil .  I hope not , answered Mr . Pitkin , in a tone which seemed to imply that he rather expected to be .  Phil began to feel uncomfortable . It seemed evident that whatever he did would be closely scrutinized , and that in an unfavorable spirit .  Mr . Pitkin paused before a desk at which was standing a stout man with grayish hair .  Mr . Sanderson , he said , this is the new errand boy . His name is--what is it , boy ?  Philip Brent .  You will give him something to do . Has the mail come in ?  No; we havent sent to the post-office yet .  You may send this boy at once .  Mr . Sanderson took from the desk a key and handed it to Philip .  That is the key to our box , he said . Notice the number--534 . Open it and bring the mail . Dont loiter on the way .  Yes , sir .  Philip took the key and left the warehouse . When he reached the street he said to himself:  I wonder where the post-office is ?  He did not like to confess to Mr . Sanderson that he did not know , for it would probably have been considered a disqualification for the post which he was filling .  I had better walk to Broadway , he said to himself . I suppose the post-office must be on the principal street .  In this Phil was mistaken . At that time the post-office was on Nassau Street , in an old church which had been utilized for a purpose very different from the one to which it had originally been devoted .  Reaching Broadway , Phil was saluted by a bootblack , with a grimy but honest-looking face .  Shine your boots , mister ? said the boy , with a grin .  Not this morning .  Some other morning , then ?  Yes , answered Phil .  Sorry you wont give me a job , said the bootblack . My taxes comes due to-day , and I aint got enough to pay em .  Phil was amused , for his new acquaintance scarcely looked like a heavy taxpayer .  Do you pay a big tax ? he asked .  A thousand dollars or less , answered the knight of the brush .  I guess its less , said Phil .  Thats where your heads level , young chap .  Is the post-office far from here ?  Over half a mile , I reckon .  Is it on this street ?  No , its on Nassau Street .  If you will show me the way there Ill give you ten cents .  All right! The walkll do me good . Come on!  Whats your name ? asked Phil , who had become interested in his new acquaintance .  The boys call me Ragged Dick .  It was indeed the lively young bootblack whose history was afterward given in a volume which is probably familiar to many of my readers . At this time he was only a bootblack , and had not yet begun to feel the spur of that ambition which led to his subsequent prosperity .  Thats a queer name , said Phil .  I try to live up to it , said Dick , with a comical glance at his ragged coat , which had originally been worn by a man six feet in height .  He swung his box over his shoulder , and led the way to the old post-office .    CHAPTER XII .  MR . LIONEL LAKE AGAIN .  Phil continued his conversation with Ragged Dick , and was much amused by his quaint way of expressing himself .  When they reached Murray Street , Dick said:  Follow me . Well cut across the City Hall Park . It is the shortest way .  Soon they reached the shabby old building with which New Yorkers were then obliged to be content with as a post-office .  Phil secured the mail matter for Pitkin & Co . , and was just about leaving the office , when he noticed just ahead of him a figure which looked very familiar .  It flashed upon him of a sudden that it was his old train acquaintance , Lionel Lake . He immediately hurried forward and touched his arm .  Mr . Lake , who had several letters in his hand , started nervously , and turned at the touch . He recognized Phil , but appeared not to do so .  What do you wish , boy ? he asked , loftily .  I want to speak a word with you , Mr . Lake .  The young man shrugged his shoulders .  You are mistaken in the person , he said . My name is not Lake .  Very likely not , said Phil significantly , but thats what you called yourself when we met on the train .  I repeat , boy , that you are strangely mistaken . My name is--he paused slightly--John Montgomery .  Just as you please . Whatever your name is , I have a little business with you .  I cant stop . My business is urgent , said Lake .  Then I will be brief . I lent you five dollars on a ring which I afterward discovered to be stolen . I want you to return that money .  Mr . Lake looked about him apprehensively , for he did not wish any one to hear what Phil was saying .  You must be crazy! he said . I never saw you before in the whole course of my life .  He shook off Phils detaining hand , and was about to hurry away , but Phil said resolutely:  You cant deceive me , Mr . Lake . Give me that money , or I will call a policeman .  Now , it happened that a policeman was passing just outside , and Lake could see him .  This is an infamous outrage! he said , but I have an important appointment , and cant be detained . Take the money . I give it to you in charity .  Phil gladly received and pocketed the bank-note , and relinquishing his hold of Mr . Lake , rejoined Dick , who had been an interested eye-witness of the interview .  I see youve got pluck , said Dick . Whats it all about ?  Phil told him .  I aint a bit sprised , said Dick . I could tell by his looks that the man was a skin .  Well , Im even with him , at any rate , said Phil .  Now Ill be getting back to the office . Thank you for your guidance . Heres a quarter .  You only promised me ten cents .  Its worth a quarter . I hope to meet you again .  Well meet at Astors next party , said Dick , with a grin . My invite came yesterday .  Mine hasnt come yet , said Phil , smiling .  Maybe itll come to-morrow .  Hes a queer chap , thought Phil . Hes fit for something better than blacking boots . I hope hell have the luck to get it .  Phil had been detained by his interview with Mr . Lake , but he made up for it by extra speed , and reached the warehouse in fair time . After delivering the letters he was sent out on another errand , and during the entire day he was kept busy .  Leaving him for the moment we go back to the Pitkin mansion , and listen to & conversation between Mr . and Mrs . Pitkin .  Uncle Oliver is getting more and more eccentric every day , said the lady . He brought home a boy to lunch to-day--some one whom he had picked up in the street .  Was the boys name Philip Brent ? asked her husband .  Yes , I believe so . What do you know about him ? asked the lady in surprise .  I have engaged him as errand boy .  You have! What for ? exclaimed Mrs . Pitkin .  I couldnt help it . He brought a letter from your uncle , requesting me to do so , and offering to pay his wages out of his own pocket .  This is really getting very serious , said Mrs . Pitkin , annoyed . Suppose he should take a fancy to this boy ?  He appears to have done so already , said her husband dryly .  I mean , suppose he should adopt him ?  You are getting on pretty fast , Lavinia , are you not ?  Such things happen sometimes , said the lady , nodding . If it should happen it would be bad for poor Lonny .  Even in that case Lonny wont have to go to the poor-house .  Mr . Pitkin , you dont realize the danger . Heres Uncle Oliver worth a quarter of a million dollars , and it ought to be left to us .  Probably it will be .  He may leave it all to this boy . This must be prevented .  How ?  You must say the boy doesnt suit you , and discharge him .  Well , well , give me time . I have no objection; but I suspect it will be hard to find any fault with him . He looks like a reliable boy .  To me he looks like an artful young adventurer , said Mrs . Pitkin vehemently . Depend upon it , Mr . Pitkin , he will spare no pains to ingratiate himself into Uncle Olivers favor .  It will be seen that Mrs . Pitkin was gifted--if it can be called a gift--with a very suspicious temperament . She was mean and grasping , and could not bear the idea of even a small part of her uncles money going to any one except her own family . There was , indeed , another whose relationship to Uncle Oliver was as close--a cousin , who had estranged her relatives by marrying a poor bookkeeper , with whom she had gone to Milwaukee . Her name was never mentioned in the Pitkin household , and Mrs . Pitkin , trusting to the distance between them , did not apprehend any danger from this source . Had she known Rebecca Forbush was even now in New York , a widow with one child , struggling to make a living by sewing and taking lodgers , she would have felt less tranquil . But she knew nothing of all this , nor did she dream that the boy whom she dreaded was the very next day to make the acquaintance of this despised relation .  This was the way that it happened:  Phil soon tired of the room he had taken in Fifth Street . It was not neatly kept , and was far from comfortable . Then again , he found that the restaurants , cheap as they were , were likely to absorb about all his salary , though the bill-of-fare was far from attractive .  Chance took him through a side-street , between Second and Third Avenues , in the neighborhood of Thirteenth Street .  Among the three and four-story buildings that lined the block was one frame-house , two-story-and-basement , on which he saw a sign , Board for Gentlemen . He had seen other similar signs , but his attention was specially drawn to this by seeing a pleasant-looking woman enter the house with the air of proprietor . This woman recalled to Philip his own mother , to whom she bore a striking resemblance .  I would like to board with one whose face recalled that of my dear dead mother , thought Phil , and on the impulse of the moment , just after the woman had entered , he rang the door-bell .  The door was opened almost immediately by the woman he had just seen enter .  It seemed to Phil almost as if he were looking into his mothers face , and he inquired in an unsteady voice:  Do you take boarders ?  Yes , was the answer . Wont you step in ?    CHAPTER XIII .  PHILS NEW HOME .  The house was poorly furnished with cheap furniture , but there was an unexpected air of neatness about it . There is a great difference between respectable and squalid poverty . It was the first of these that was apparent in the small house in which our hero found himself .  I am looking for a boarding-place , said Philip . I cannot afford to pay a high price .  And I should not think of asking a high price for such plain accommodations as I can offer , said Mrs . Forbush . What sort of a room do you desire ?  A small room will answer .  I have a hall-bedroom at the head of the stairs . Will you go up and look at it ?  I should like to do so .  Mrs . Forbush led the way up a narrow staircase , and Philip followed her .  Opening the door of the small room referred to , she showed a neat bed , a chair , a wash-stand , and a few hooks from which clothing might be hung . It was plain enough , but there was an air of neatness which did not characterize his present room .  I like the room , he said , brightening up . How much do you charge for this room and board ?  Four dollars . That includes breakfast and supper , answered Mrs . Forbush . Lunch you provide for yourself .  That will be satisfactory , said Phil . I am in a place down town , and I could not come to lunch , at any rate .  When would you like to come , Mr .---- ? said the widow interrogatively .  My name is Philip Brent .  Mr . Brent .  I will come some time to-morrow .  Generally I ask a small payment in advance , as a guarantee that an applicant will really come , but I am sure I can trust you .  Thank you , but I am quite willing to conform to your usual rule , said Phil , as he drew a two-dollar bill from his pocket and handed it to the widow .  So they parted , mutually pleased . Phils week at his present lodging would not be up for several days , but he was tired of it , and felt that he would be much more comfortable with Mrs . Forbush . So he was ready to make the small pecuniary sacrifice needful .  The conversation which has been recorded took but five minutes , and did not materially delay Phil , who , as I have already said , was absent from the store on an errand .  The next day Phil became installed at his new boarding-place , and presented himself at supper .  There were three other boarders , two being a young salesman at a Third Avenue store and his wife . They occupied a square room on the same floor with Phil . The other was a female teacher , employed in one of the city public schools . The only remaining room was occupied by a drummer , who was often called away for several days together . This comprised the list of boarders , but Phils attention was called to a young girl of fourteen , of sweet and attractive appearance , whom he ascertained to be a daughter of Mrs . Forbush . The young lady herself , Julia Forbush , cast frequent glances at Phil , who , being an unusually good-looking boy , would naturally excite the notice of a young girl .  On the whole , it seemed a pleasant and social circle , and Phil felt that he had found a home .  The next day , as he was occupied in the store , next to G . Washington Wilbur , he heard that young man say:  Why , theres Mr . Carter coming into the store!  Mr . Oliver Carter , instead of making his way directly to the office where Mr . Pitkin was sitting , came up to where Phil was at work .  How are you getting along , my young friend ? he asked familiarly .  Very well , thank you , sir .  Do you find your duties very fatiguing ?  Oh , no , sir . I have a comfortable time .  Thats right . Work cheerfully and you will win the good opinion of your employer . Dont forget to come up and see me soon .  Thank you , sir .  You seem to be pretty solid with the old man , remarked Mr . Wilbur .  We are on very good terms , answered Phil , smiling .  I wish you had introduced him to me , said Wilbur .  Dont you know him ? asked Phil , in surprise .  He doesnt often come to the store , and when he does he generally goes at once to the office , and the clerks dont have a chance to get acquainted .  I should hardly like to take the liberty , then , said Phil .  Oh , keep him to yourself , then , if you want to , said Mr . Wilbur , evidently annoyed .  I dont care to do that . I shall be entirely willing to introduce you when there is a good chance .  This seemed to appease Mr . Wilbur , who became once more gracious .  Philip , he said , as the hour of closing approached , why cant you come around and call upon me this evening ?  So I will , answered Phil readily .  Indeed , he found it rather hard to fill up his evenings , and was glad to have a way suggested .  Do . I want to tell you a secret .  Where do you live ? asked Phil .  No .---- East Twenty-second Street .  All right . I will come round about half-past seven .  Though Wilbur lived in a larger house than he , Phil did not like his room as well . There being only one chair in the room , Mr . Wilbur put his visitor in it , and himself sat on the bed .  There was something of a mystery in the young mans manner as , after clearing his throat , he said to Phil:  I am going to tell you a secret .  Phils curiosity was somewhat stirred , and he signified that he would like to hear it .  I have for some time wanted a confidant , said Mr . Wilbur . I did not wish to trust a mere acquaintance , for--ahem!--the matter is quite a delicate one .  Phil regarded him with increased interest .  I am flattered by your selecting me , said he . I will keep your secret .  Phil , said Mr . Wilbur , in a tragic tone , you may be surprised to hear that I am in LOVE!  Phil started and wanted to laugh , but Mr . Wilburs serious , earnest look restrained him .  Aint you rather young ? he ventured to say .  No; I am nineteen , answered Mr . Wilbur .  The heart makes no account of years .  Whether this was original or borrowed , Phil could not tell .  Have you been in love long ? asked Phil .  Three weeks .  Does the lady know it ?  Not yet , returned Mr . Wilbur . I have worshiped her from afar . I have never even spoken to her .  Then the matter hasnt gone very far ?  No , not yet .  Where did you meet her first ?  In a Broadway stage .  What is her name ?  I dont know .  You dont know much about her , then ?  Yes; I know where she lives .  Where ?  On Lexington Avenue .  Whereabouts ?  Between Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth Streets . Would you like to see her house ?  Yes , answered Phil , who saw that Mr . Wilbur wished him so to answer .  Then come out . We might see her .  The two boys--for Mr . Wilbur , though he considered himself a young man of large experience , was really scarcely more than a boy--bent their steps to Lexington Avenue , and walked in a northerly direction .  They had reached Twenty-eighth Street , when the door of house farther up on the avenue was opened and a lady came out .  Thats she! ejaculated Mr . Wilbur , clutching Phil by the arm .  Phil looked , and saw a tall young lady , three or four inches taller than his friend and as many years older . He looked at his companion with surprise .  Is that the young lady you are in love with ? he asked .  Yes; isnt she a daisy ? asked the lover fervently .  I am not much of a judge of daisies , answered Phil , a little embarrassed , for the young lady had large features , and was , in his eyes , very far from pretty .    CHAPTER XIV .  CONSULTING THE ORACLE .  Phil did not like to hurt the feelings of his companion , and refrained from laughing , though with difficulty .  She doesnt appear to know you , he said .  No , said Wilbur; I havent had a chance to make myself known to her .  Do you think you can make a favorable impression upon--the daisy ? asked Phil , outwardly sober , but inwardly amused .  I always had a taking way with girls , replied Mr . Wilbur complacently .  Phil coughed . It was all that saved him from laughing .  While he was struggling with the inclination , the lady inadvertently dropped a small parcel which she had been carrying in her hand . The two boys were close behind . Like an arrow from the bow Mr . Wilbur sprang forward , picked up the parcel , and while his heart beat wildly , said , as he tendered it to the owner , with a graceful bow and captivating smile:  Miss , I believe you dropped this .  Thank you , my good boy , answered the daisy pleasantly .  Mr . Wilbur staggered back as if he had been struck . He fell back in discomfiture , and his face showed the mortification and anguish he felt .  Did you hear what she said ? he asked , in a hollow voice .  She called you a boy , didnt she ?  Yes , answered Mr . Wilbur sadly .  Perhaps she may be near-sighted , said Phil consolingly .  Do you think so ? asked Mr . Wilbur hopefully .  It is quite possible . Then you are short , you know .  Yes , it must be so , said G . Washington Wilbur , his face more serene . If she hadnt been she would have noticed my mustache .  True .  She spoke kindly . If--if she had seen how old I was , it would have been different , dont you think so ?  Yes , no doubt .  There is only one thing to do , said Mr . Wilbur , in a tone of calm resolve .  What is that ? inquired Phil , in some curiosity .  I must wear a stove-pipe hat! As you say , I am small , and a near-sighted person might easily suppose me to be younger than I am . Now , with a stove-pipe hat I shall look much older .  Yes , I presume so .  Then I can make her acquaintance again , and she will not mistake me . Phil , why dont you wear a stove-pipe ?  Because I dont want to look any older than I am . Besides , an errand-boy wouldnt look well in a tall hat .  No , perhaps not .  And Mr . Pitkin would hardly like it .  Of course . When you are a salesman like me it will be different .  Mr . Wilbur was beginning to recover his complacency , which had been so rudely disturbed .  I suppose you wouldnt think of marrying on your present salary ? said Phil . Six dollars a week wouldnt support a married pair very well .  The firm would raise my salary . They always do when a man marries . Besides , I have other resources .  Indeed ?  Yes; I am worth two thousand dollars . It was left me by an aunt , and is kept in trust for me until I am twenty-one . I receive the interest now .  I congratulate you , said Phil , who was really pleased to hear of his companions good fortune .  That money will come in handy .  Besides , I expect SHES got money , continued Mr . Wilbur . Of course , I love her for herself alone--I am not mercenary--still , it will be a help when we are married .  So it will , said Phil , amused at the confident manner in which Mr . Wilbur spoke of marriage with a lady of whom he knew absolutely nothing .  Philip , said Mr . Wilbur , when I marry , I want you to stand up with me--to be my groomsman .  If I am in the city , and can afford to buy a dress-suit , I might consent .  Thank you . You are a true friend! said Mr . Wilbur , squeezing his hand fervently .  The two returned to Mr . Wilburs room and had a chat . At an early hour Phil returned to his own boarding-place .  As time passed on , Phil and Wilbur spent considerable time together out of the store . Mr . G . Washington Wilbur , apart from his amusing traits , was a youth of good principles and good disposition , and Phil was glad of his company . Sometimes they went to cheap amusements , but not often , for neither had money to spare for such purposes .  Some weeks after Phils entrance upon his duties Mr . Wilbur made a proposal to Phil of a startling nature .  Suppose we have our fortunes told , Phil ? he said .  If it would help my fortune , or hurry it up , I shouldnt object , said Phil , smiling .  I want to know what fate has in store for me , said Wilbur .  Do you think the fortune-tellers know any better than you do ? asked Phil incredulously .  They tell some strange things , said Wilbur .  What , for instance ?  An aunt of mine went to a fortune-teller and asked if she would ever be married , and when ? She was told that she would be married before she was twenty-two , to a tall , light-complexioned man .  Did it come true ?  Yes , every word , said Mr . Wilbur solemnly . She was married three months before her twenty-second birthday , and her husband was just the kind of man that was predicted . Wasnt that strange ?  The fortune-teller might easily have guessed all that . Most girls are married as young as that .  But not to tall , light-complexioned men! said Wilbur triumphantly .  Is there anything you wish particularly to know ? asked Phil .  I should like to know if I am going to marry--you know who .  The daisy ?  Yes .  Phil was not much in favor of the scheme , but finally agreed to it .  There was a certain Veiled Lady , who advertised her qualifications in the Herald , as the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter , and therefore gifted with the power to read the future . Mr . Wilbur made choice of her , and together they went to call upon her one evening .  They were shown into an anteroom , and in due time Mr . Wilbur was called into the dread presence . He was somewhat nervous and agitated , but braced up , as he afterward expressed it , and went in . He wanted Phil to go in with him , but the attendant said that madam would not allow it , and he went forward alone .  Fifteen minutes afterward he re-entered the room with a radiant face .  Have you heard good news ? asked Phil .  Mr . Wilbur nodded emphatically and whispered , for there were two others in waiting:  Its all right . I am to marry her .  Did the fortune-teller say so ?  Yes .  Did she give her name ?  No , but she described her so that I knew her at once .  Will it be soon ? asked Phil slyly .  Not till I am twenty-four , answered Mr . Wilbur soberly . But perhaps she may be mistaken about that . Perhaps she thought I was older than I am .  Do you doubt her knowledge , then ?  No; at any rate , I can wait , since she is to be mine at last . Besides , I am to be rich . When I am thirty years old I am to be worth twenty thousand dollars .  I congratulate you , Wilbur , said Phil , smiling . You are all right , at least .  The next gentleman! said the attendant .  Phil entered the inner room , and looked about him in curiosity .  A tall woman sat upon a sort of throne , with one hand resting on a table beside her . A tall wax-taper supplied the place of the light of day , which was studiously excluded from the room by thick , dark curtains . Over the womans face was a black veil , which gave her an air of mystery .  Come hither , boy! she said , in a clear , commanding voice .  Phil advanced , not wholly unimpressed , though he felt skeptical .  The woman bent forward , starting slightly and scanned his face eagerly .    CHAPTER XV .  PHIL AND THE FORTUNE-TELLER .  Do you wish to hear of the past or the future ? asked the fortune-teller .  Tell me something of the past , said Phil , with a view of testing the knowledge of the seeress .  You have left an uncongenial home to seek your fortune in New York . You left without regret , and those whom you have left behind do not miss you .  Phil started in amazement . This was certainly true .  Shall I find the fortune I seek ? asked our hero earnestly .  Yes , but not in the way you expect . You think yourself alone in the world!  The fortune-teller paused , and looked searchingly at the boy .  So I am , returned Phil .  No boy who has a father living can consider himself alone .  My father is dead! returned Phil , growing skeptical .  You are mistaken .  I am not likely to be mistaken in such a matter . My father died a few months since .  Your father still lives! said the fortune-teller sharply . Do not contradict me!  I dont see how you can say that . I attended his funeral .  You attended the funeral of the man whose name you bear . He was not your father .  Phil was much excited by this confirmation of his step-mothers story . He had entertained serious doubts of its being true , thinking it might have been trumped up by Mrs . Brent to drive him from home , and interfere with his succession to any part of Mr . Brents property .  Is my step-mothers story true , then ? he asked breathlessly . She told me I was not the son of Mr . Brent .  Her story was true , said the veiled lady .  Who is my real father , then ?  The lady did not immediately reply . She seemed to be peering into distant space , as she said slowly:  I see a man of middle size , dark-complexioned , leading a small child by the hand . He pauses before a house--it looks like an inn . A lady comes out from the inn . She is kindly of aspect . She takes the child by the hand and leads him into the inn . Now I see the man go away--alone . The little child remains behind . I see him growing up . He has become a large boy , but the scene has changed . The inn has disappeared . I see a pleasant village and a comfortable house . The boy stands at the door . He is well-grown now . A lady stands on the threshold as his steps turn away . She is thin and sharp-faced . She is not like the lady who welcomed the little child . Can you tell me who this boy is ? asked the fortune-teller , fixing her eyes upon Phil .  It is myself! he answers , his flushed face showing the excitement he felt .  You have said!  I dont know how you have learned all this , said Phil , but it is wonderfully exact . Will you answer a question ?  Ask!  You say my father--my real father--is living ?  The veiled lady bowed her head .  Where is he ?  That I cannot say , but he is looking for you .  He is in search of me ?  Yes .  Why has he delayed it so long ?  There are circumstances which I cannot explain which have prevented his seeking and claiming you .  Will he do so ?  I have told you that he is now seeking for you . I think he will find you at last .  What can I do to bring this about ?  Do nothing! Stay where you are . Circumstances are working favorably , but you must wait . There are some drawbacks .  What are they ?  You have two enemies , or rather one , for the other does not count .  Is that enemy a man ?  No , it is a woman .  My step-mother! ejaculated Phil , with immediate conviction .  You have guessed aright .  And who is the other ?  A boy .  Jonas ?  It is the son of the woman whom you call your step-mother .  What harm can they do me ? I am not afraid of them , said Phil , raising his head proudly .  Do not be too confident! The meanest are capable of harm . Mrs . Brent does not like you because she is a mother .  She fears that I will interfere with her son .  You are all right .  Is there anything more you can tell me ? asked Phil . Have I any other enemies ?  Yes; there are two more--also a woman and her son .  That puzzles me . I can think of no one .  They live in the city .  I know . It is Mrs . Pitkin , my employers wife . Why should she dislike me ?  There is an old man who likes you . That is the cause .  I see . She doesnt want him to be kind to any one out of the family .  That is all I have to tell you , said the fortune-teller abruptly . You can go .  You have told me strange things , said Phil . Will you tell me how it is you know so much about a stranger ?  I have nothing more to tell you . You can go! said the veiled lady impatiently .  At least tell me how much I am to pay you .  Nothing .  But I thought you received fees .  Not from you .  Did you not take something from my friend who was in here before me ?  Yes .  You told him a good fortune .  He is a fool! said the fortune-teller contemptuously . I saw what he wanted and predicted it .  She waved her hand , and Phil felt that he had no excuse for remaining longer .  He left the room slowly , and found Mr . Wilbur anxiously awaiting him .  What did she tell you , Phil ? he asked eagerly . Did she tell you what sort of a wife you would have ?  No . I didnt ask her , answered Phil , smiling .  I should think youd want to know . What did she tell you , then ?  She told me quite a number of things about my past life and the events of my childhood .  I shouldnt have cared about that , said Wilbur , shrugging his shoulders . Why , I know all about that myself . What I want to know about is , whether I am to marry the girl I adore .  But you see , Wilbur , I dont adore anybody . I am not in love as you are .  Of course that makes a difference , said Wilbur . Im glad I came , Phil . Aint you ?  Yes , answered Phil slowly .  You see , its such a satisfaction to know that all is coming right at last . I am to marry HER , you know , and although it isnt till I am twenty-four----  She will be nearly thirty by that time , said Phil slyly .  She wont look it! said Mr . Wilbur , wincing a little . When I am thirty I shall be worth twenty thousand dollars .  You cant save it very soon out of six dollars a week .  That is true . I feel sure I shall be raised soon . Did the fortune-teller say anything about your getting rich ?  No . I cant remember that she did . Oh , yes! she said I would make my fortune , but not in the way I expected .  That is queer! said Mr . Wilbur , interested . What could she mean ?  I suppose she meant that I would not save a competence out of five dollars a week .  Maybe so .  I have been thinking , Wilbur , you have an advantage over the young lady you are to marry . You know that you are to marry her , but she doesnt know who is to be her husband .  That is true , said Wilbur seriously . If I can find out her name , I will write her an anonymous letter , asking her to call on the veiled Lady .    CHAPTER XVI .  MRS . BRENTS STRANGE TEMPTATION .  Now that Phil is fairly established in the city , circumstances require us to go back to the country town which he had once called home .  Mrs . Brent is sitting , engaged with her needle , in the same room where she had made the important revelation to Phil .  Jonas entered the house , stamping the snow from his boots .  Is supper most ready , mother ? he asked .  No , Jonas; it is only four oclock , replied Mrs . Brent .  Im as hungry as a bear . I guess its the skating .  I wish you would go to the post-office before supper , Jonas . There might be a letter .  Do you expect to hear from Phil ?  He said nothing about writing , said Mrs . Brent indifferently . He will do as he pleases about it .  I didnt know but he would be writing for money , chuckled Jonas .  If he did , I would send him some , said Mrs . Brent .  You would! repeated Jonas , looking at his mother in surprise .  Yes , I would send him a dollar or two , so that people neednt talk . It is always best to avoid gossip .  Are you expecting a letter from anybody , mother ? asked Jonas , after a pause .  I dreamed last night I should receive an important letter , said Mrs . Brent .  With money in it ? asked Jonas eagerly .  I dont know .  If any such letter comes , will you give me some of the money ?  If you bring me a letter containing money , said Mrs . Brent , I will give you a dollar .  Enough said! exclaimed Jonas , who was fond of money; Im off to the post-office at once .  Mrs . Brent let the work fall into her lap and looked intently before her . A flush appeared on her pale face , and she showed signs of restlessness .  It is strange , she said to herself , how I have allowed myself to be affected by that dream . I am not superstitious , but I cannot get over the idea that a letter will reach me to-night , and that it will have an important bearing upon my life . I have a feeling , too , that it will relate to the boy Philip .  She rose from her seat and began to move about the room . It was a relief to her in the restless state of her mind . She went to the window to look for Jonas , and her excitement rose as she saw him approaching . When he saw his mother looking from the window , he held aloft a letter .  The letter has come , she said , her heart beating faster than its wont . It is an important letter . How slow Jonas is .  And she was inclined to be vexed at the deliberation with which her son was advancing toward the house .  But he came at last .  Well , mother , Ive got a letter--a letter from Philadelphia , he said . It isnt from Phil , for I know his writing .  Give it to me , Jonas , said his mother , outwardly calm , but inwardly excited .  Do you know any one in Philadelphia , mother ?  No .  She cut open the envelope and withdrew the inclosed sheet .  Is there any money in it ? asked Jonas eagerly .  No .  Just my luck! said Jonas sullenly .  Wait a minute , said his mother . If the letter is really important , Ill give you twenty-five cents .  She read the letter , and her manner soon showed that she was deeply interested .  We will look over her shoulders and read it with her:   CONTINENTAL HOTEL , PHILADELPHIA , Feb . 5 .  DEAR MADAM:--  I write to you on a matter of the greatest importance to my happiness , and shall most anxiously await your reply . I would come to you in person , but am laid up with an attack of rheumatism , and my physician forbids me to travel .  You are , as I have been informed , the widow of Gerald Brent , who thirteen years since kept a small hotel in the small village of Fultonville , in Ohio . At that date I one day registered myself as his guest . I was not alone . My only son , then a boy of three , accompanied me . My wife was dead , and my affections centered upon this child . Yet the next morning I left him under the charge of yourself and your husband , and pursued my journey . From that day to this I have not seen the boy , nor have I written to you or Mr . Brent . This seems strange , does it not ? It requires an explanation , and that explanation I am ready to give .  To be brief , then , I was fleeing from undeserved suspicion . Circumstances which I need not detail had connected my name with the mysterious disappearance of a near friend , and the fact that a trifling dispute between us had taken place in the presence of witnesses had strengthened their suspicions . Knowing myself to be innocent , but unable to prove it , I fled , taking my child with me . When I reached Fultonville , I became alive to the ease with which I might be traced , through the childs companionship . There was no resource but to leave him . Your husband and yourself impressed me as kind and warm-hearted . I was specially impressed by the gentleness with which you treated my little Philip , and I felt that to you I could safely trust him . I did not , however , dare to confide my secret to any one . I simply said I would leave the boy with you till he should recover from his temporary indisposition , and then , with outward calmness but inward anguish , I left my darling , knowing not if I should ever see him again .  Well , time passed . I went to Nevada , changed my name , invested the slender sum I had with me in mining , and , after varying fortune , made a large fortune at last . But better fortune still awaited me . In a poor mining hut , two months since , I came across a man who confessed that he was guilty of the murder of which I had been suspected . His confession was reduced in writing , sworn to before a magistrate , and now at last I feel myself a free man . No one now could charge me with a crime from which my soul revolted .  When this matter was concluded , my first thought was of the boy whom I had not seen for thirteen long years . I could claim him now before all the world; I could endow him with the gifts of fortune; I could bring him up in luxury , and I could satisfy a fathers affectionate longing . I could not immediately ascertain where you were . I wrote to Fultonville , to the postmaster , and learned that you and Mr . Brent had moved away and settled down in Gresham , in the State of New York . I learned also that my Philip was still living , but other details I did not learn . But I cared not , so long as my boy still lived .  And now you may guess my wish and my intention . I shall pay you handsomely for your kind care of Philip , but I must have my boy back again . We have been separated too long . I can well understand that you are attached to him , and I will find a home for you and Mr . Brent near my own , where you can see as often as you like the boy whom you have so tenderly reared . Will you do me the favor to come at once , and bring the boy with you ? The expenses of your journey shall , of course , be reimbursed , and I will take care that the pecuniary part of my obligations to you shall be amply repaid . I have already explained why I cannot come in person to claim my dear child .  Telegraph to me when you will reach Philadelphia , and I will engage a room for you . Philip will stay with me .  Yours gratefully ,  OSCAR GRANVILLE .   Mother , here is a slip of paper that has dropped from the letter , said Jonas .  He picked up and handed to his mother a check on a Philadelphia bank for the sum of one hundred dollars .  Why , thats the same as money , isnt it ? asked Jonas .  Yes , Jonas .  Then youll keep your promise , wont you ?  Mrs . Brent silently drew from her pocket-book a two-dollar bill and handed it to Jonas .  Jonas , she said , if you wont breathe a word of it , I will tell you a secret .  All right , mother .  We start for Philadelphia to-morrow .  By gosh! thats jolly , exclaimed Jonas , overjoyed . Ill keep mum . What was in the letter , mother ?  I will not tell you just now . You shall know very soon .  Mrs . Brent did not sleep much that night . Her mind was intent upon a daring scheme of imposture . Mr . Granville was immensely wealthy , no doubt . Why should she not pass off Jonas upon him as his son Philip , and thus secure a fortune for her own child ?    CHAPTER XVII .  JONAS JOINS THE CONSPIRACY .  Later in the evening Mrs . Brent took Jonas into her confidence . She was a silent , secretive woman by nature , and could her plan have been carried out without imparting it to any one , she would gladly have had it so . But Jonas must be her active accomplice , and it was as well to let him know at once what he must do .  In the evening , when Jonas , tired with his days skating , was lying on the lounge , Mrs . Brent rose deliberately from her seat , peeped into the adjoining room , then went to each window to make sure there was no eavesdropper , then resumed her seat and said:  Jonas , get up . I want to speak to you .  I am awfully tired , mother . I can hear you while I lie here .  Jonas , do you hear me ? I am about to speak to you of something no other person must hear . Get a chair and draw it close to mine .  Jonas rose , his curiosity stimulated by his mothers words and manner .  Is it about the letter , mother ? he asked .  Yes , it relates to the letter and our journey to-morrow .  Jonas had wondered what the letter was about and who had sent his mother the hundred-dollar check , and he made no further objection . He drew a chair in front of his mother and said:  Go ahead , mother , Im listening .  Would you like to be rich , Jonas ? asked Mrs . Brent .  Wouldnt I ?  Would you like to be adopted by a very rich man , have a pony to ride , plenty of pocket-money , fine clothes and in the end a large fortune ?  That would just suit me , mother , answered the boy eagerly . Is there any chance of it ?  Yes , if you follow my directions implicitly .  I will , mother , said Jonas , his eyes shining with desire . Only tell me what to do and Ill do it .  Do you remember what I told Philip the evening before he went away ?  About his being left at Mr . Brents hotel ? Yes , I remember it .  And about his true father having disappeared ?  Yes , yes .  Jonas , the letter I received this afternoon was from Philips real father .  By gosh! ejaculated Jonas , altering his usual expression of surprise .  He is in Philadelphia . He is a very rich man .  Then Phil will be rich , said Jonas , disappointed . I thought you said it would be me .  Philips father has never seen him since he was three years old , continued Mrs . Brent , taking no notice of her sons tone .  What difference does that make , mother ?  Jonas , said Mrs . Brent , bending toward her son , if I choose to tell him that you are Philip , he wont know the difference . Do you understand ?  Jonas did understand .  Thats a bully idea , mother! Can we pull the wool over the old mans eyes , do you think ?  I wish you would not use such expressions , Jonas . They are not gentlemanly , and you are to be a young gentleman .  All right , mother .  We can manage it if you are very careful . It is worth the trouble , Jonas . I think Mr . Granville--that is his name--must be worth a quarter of a million dollars , and if he takes you for Philip the whole will probably go to you .  What a head youve got , mother! exclaimed Jonas admiringly . It is a tip-top chance .  Yes , it is one chance in ten thousand . But you must do just as I tell you .  Oh , Ill do that , mother . What must I do ?  To begin with , you must take Philips name . You must remember that you are no longer Jonas Webb , but Philip Brent .  Thatll be a bully joke! said Jonas , very much amused . What would Phil say if he knew I had taken his name ?  He must not know . Henceforth we must endeavor to keep out of his way . Again , you must consider me your step-mother , not your own mother .  Yes , I understand . What are you going to do first , mother ?  We start for Philadelphia to-morrow . Your father is lying sick at the Continental Hotel .  Jonas roared with delight at the manner in which his mother spoke of the sick stranger .  Oh , itll be fun , mother! Shall we live in Philadelphia ?  I dont know . That will be as Mr . Granville thinks best .  Where are you going , mother ? Are you going to live here ?  Of course I shall be with you . I will make that a condition . I cannot be parted from my only boy .  But I shall be Mr . Granvilles boy .  To the public you will be . But when we are together in private , we shall be once more mother and son .  I am afraid you will spoil all , said Jonas . Old Granville will suspect something if you seem to care too much for me .  The selfish nature of Jonas was cropping out , and his mother felt , with a pang , that he would be reconciled to part with her forever for the sake of the brilliant prospects and the large fortune which Mr . Granville could offer him .  She was outwardly cold , but such affection as she was capable of she expended on this graceless and ungrateful boy .  You seem to forget that I may have some feeling in the matter , said Mrs . Brent coldly , but with inward pain . If the result of this plan were to be that we should be permanently separated , I would never consent to it .  Just as you like , mother , said Jonas , with an ill grace . I dont look much like Phil .  No , there will be a difficulty . Still Mr . Granville has never seen Philip since he was three years old , and that is in our favor . He thinks I am Mr . Brents first wife .  Shall you tell him ?  I dont know . I will be guided by circumstances . Perhaps it may be best . I wouldnt like to have it discovered that I had deceived him in that .  How are you going to manage about this place , mother ?  I am going to write to your Uncle Jonas to take charge of it . I will let him have it at a nominal rent . Then , if our plan miscarries we shall have a place to come back to .  Were you ever in Philadelphia , mother ?  No; but there will be no trouble in journeying there . I shall pack your clothes and my own to-night . Of course , Jonas , when you meet Mr . Granville you must seem to be fond of him . Then you must tell him how kind I have been to you . In fact , you must act precisely as Philip might be expected to do .  Yes , mother; and you must be careful not to call me Jonas . That will spoil all , you know .  Rest assured that I shall be on my guard . If you are as careful as I am , Philip----  Jonas burst into a guffaw at the new name .  Its just like play-acting , mother , he said .  But it will pay better , said Mrs . Brent quietly . I think it will be best for me to begin calling you Philip at once--that is , as soon as we have left town--so that we may both get accustomed to it .  All right , mother . Youve got a good headpiece .  I will manage things properly . If you consent to be guided by me , all will be right .  Oh , Ill do it mother . I wish we were on our way .  You can go to bed if you like . I must stay up late to-night . I have to pack our trunks .  The next day the pair of adventurers left Gresham . From the earliest available point Mrs . Brent telegraphed to Mr . Granville that she was on her way , with the son from whom he had so long been separated .    CHAPTER XVIII .  THE CONSPIRACY SUCCEEDS .  In a handsome private parlor at the Continental Hotel a man of about forty-five years of age sat in an easy-chair . He was of middle height , rather dark complexion , and a pleasant expression . His right foot was bandaged , and rested on a chair . The morning Daily Ledger was in his hand , but he was not reading . His mind , judging from his absorbed look , was occupied with other thoughts .  I can hardly realize , he said half-aloud , that my boy will so soon be restored to my arms . We have been separated by a cruel fate , but we shall soon be together again . I remember how the dear child looked when I left him at Fultonville in the care of the kind inn-keeper . I am sorry he is dead , but his widow shall be suitably repaid for her kind devotion .  He had reached this point when a knock was heard at the door .  Come in! said Mr . Granville .  A servant of the hotel appeared .  A lady and a boy are in the parlor below , sir . They wish to see you .  Though Mr . Granville had considerable control over his feelings , his heart beat fast when he heard these words .  Will you show them up at once ? he said , in a tone which showed some trace of agitation .  The servant bore the message to Mrs . Brent and Jonas , who were sitting in the hotel parlor .  If Mr . Granville was agitated , the two conspirators were not wholly at their ease . There was a red spot on each of Mrs . Brents cheeks--her way of expressing emotion--and Jonas was fidgeting about uneasily in his chair , staring about him curiously .  Mind what I told you , said his mother , in a low voice . Remember to act like a boy who has suddenly been restored to his long-lost father . Everything depends on first impressions .  I wish it was all over; I wish I was out of it , said Jonas , wiping the perspiration from his face . Suppose he suspects ?  He wont if you do as I tell you . Dont look gawky , but act naturally .  Just then the servant reappeared .  You are to come up-stairs , he said . The gentleman will see you .  Thank you , said Mrs . Brent , rising . Come .  Jonas rose , and with the manner of a cur that expected a whipping , followed his mother and the servant .  Its only one flight , said the servant , but we can take the elevator .  It is of no consequence , Mrs . Brent began , but Jonas said eagerly:  Lets ride on the elevator , ma!  Very well , Philip , said Mrs . Brent .  A minute later the two stood at the door of Mr . Granvilles room . Next they stood in his presence .  Mr . Granville , looking eagerly toward the door , passed over Mrs . Brent , and his glance rested on the boy who followed her . He started , and there was a quick feeling of disappointment . He had been picturing to himself how his lost boy would look , but none of his visions resembled the awkward-looking boy who stood sheepishly by the side of Mrs . Brent .  Mr . Granville , I presume , said the lady .  Yes , madam . You are----  Mrs . Brent , and this , pointing to Jonas , is the boy you left at Fultonville thirteen years ago . Philip , go to your father .  Jonas advanced awkwardly to Mr . Granvilles chair , and said in parrot-like tones:  Im so glad to see you , pa!  And you are really Philip ? said Mr . Granville slowly .  Yes , Im Philip Brent; but I suppose my name is Granville now .  Come here , my boy!  Mr . Granville drew the boy to him , and looked earnestly in his face , then kissed him affectionately .  He has changed since he was a little child , Mrs . Brent , he said , with a half-sigh .  Thats to be expected , sir . He was only three years old when you left him with us .  But it seems to me that his hair and complexion are lighter .  You can judge of that better than I , said Mrs . Brent plausibly . To me , who have seen him daily , the change was not perceptible .  I am greatly indebted to you for your devoted care--to you and your husband . I am grieved to hear that Mr . Brent is dead .  Yes , sir; he left me six months since . It was a grievous loss . Ah , sir , when I give up Philip also , I shall feel quite alone in the world , and she pressed a handkerchief to her eyes . You see , I have come to look upon him as my own boy!  My dear madam , dont think that I shall be so cruel as to take him from you . Though I wish him now to live with me , you must accompany him . My home shall be yours if you are willing to accept a room in my house and a seat at my table .  Oh , Mr . Granville , how can I thank you for your great kindness ? Ever since I received your letter I have been depressed with the thought that I should lose dear Philip . If I had a child of my own it would be different; but , having none , my affections are centered upon him .  And very naturally , said Mr . Granville . We become attached to those whom we benefit . Doubtless he feels a like affection for you . You love this good lady , Philip , who has supplied to you the place of your own mother , who died in your infancy , do you not ?  Yes , sir , answered Jonas stolidly . But I want to live with my pa!  To be sure you shall . My boy , we have been separated too long already . Henceforth we will live together , and Mrs . Brent shall live with us .  Where do you live , pa ? asked Jonas .  I have a country-seat a few miles from Chicago , answered Mr . Granville . We will go there as soon as I am well enough . I ought to apologize , Mrs . Brent , for inviting you up to my room , but my rheumatism makes me a prisoner .  I hope your rheumatism will soon leave you , sir .  I think it will . I have an excellent physician , and already I am much better . I may , however , have to remain here a few days yet .  And where do you wish Philip and I to remain in the meantime ?  Here , of course . Philip , will you ring the bell ?  I dont see any bell , answered Jonas , bewildered .  Touch that knob!  Jonas did so .  Will that ring the bell ? he asked curiously .  Yes , it is an electric bell .  By gosh! ejaculated Jonas .  Dont use such language , Philip! said Mrs . Brent hastily . Your father will be shocked . You see , Mr . Granville , Philip has associated with country boys , and in spite of my care , he has adopted some of their language .  Mr . Granville himself was rather disturbed by this countrified utterance , and it occurred to him that his new-found son needed considerable polishing .  Ah , I quite understand that , Mrs . Brent , he said courteously . He is young yet , and there will be plenty of time for him to get rid of any objectionable habits and phrases .  Here the servant appeared .  Tell the clerk to assign this lady and the boy rooms on this floor if any are vacant . Mrs . Brent , Philip may have a room next to you for the present . When I am better I will have him with me . John , is dinner on the table ?  Yes , sir .  Then , after taking possession of your rooms , you and Philip had better go to dinner . I will send for him later .  Thank you , sir .  As Mrs . Brent was ushered into her handsome apartment her face was radiant with joy and exultation .  All has gone well! she said . The most difficult part is over .    CHAPTER XIX .  A NARROW ESCAPE FROM DETECTION .  The conspiracy into which Mrs . Brent had entered was a daring one , and required great coolness and audacity . But the inducements were great , and for her sons sake she decided to carry it through . Of course it was necessary that she should not be identified with any one who could disclose to Mr . Granville the deceit that was being practiced upon him . Circumstances lessened the risk of detection , since Mr . Granville was confined to his room in the hotel , and for a week she and Jonas went about the city alone .  One day she had a scare .  She was occupying a seat in a Chestnut Street car , while Jonas stood in front with the driver , when a gentleman whom she had not observed , sitting at the other end of the car , espied her .  Why , Mrs . Brent , how came you here ? he asked , in surprise , crossing over and taking a seat beside her .  Her color went and came as , in a subdued tone , she answered .  I am in Philadelphia on a little visit , Mr . Pearson .  Are you not rather out of your latitude ? asked the gentleman .  Yes , perhaps so .  How is Mr . Brent ?  Did you not hear that he was dead ?  No , indeed! I sympathize with you in your sad loss .  Yes , sighed the widow . It is a great loss to us .  I suppose Jonas is a large boy now , said the other . I havent seen him for two or three years .  Yes , he has grown , said the widow briefly . She hoped that Mr . Pearson would not discover that Jonas was with her , as she feared that the boy might betray them unconsciously .  Is he with you ?  Yes .  Do you stay long in Philadelphia ?  No , I think not , answered Mrs . Brent .  I go back to New York this afternoon , or I would ask permission to call on you .  Mrs . Brent breathed more freely . A call at the hotel was by all means to be avoided .  Of course I should have been glad to see you , she answered , feeling quite safe in saying so . Are you going far ?  I get out at Thirteenth Street .  Thank Heaven! said Mrs . Brent to herself . Then he wont discover where we are .  The Continental Hotel is situated at the corner of Chestnut and Ninth Streets , and Mrs . Brent feared that Jonas would stop the car at that point . As it was , the boy did not observe that his mother had met an acquaintance , so intent was he on watching the street sights .  When they reached Ninth Street mother and son got out and entered the hotel .  I guess Ill stay down stairs awhile , said Jonas .  No , Philip , I have something to say to you . Come up with me .  I want to go into the billiard-room , said Jonas , grumbling .  It is very important , said Mrs . Brent emphatically .  Now the curiosity of Jonas was excited , and he followed his mother into the elevator , for their rooms were on the third floor .  Well , mother , what is it ? asked Jonas , when the door of his mothers room was closed behind them .  I met a gentleman who knew me in the horse-car , said Mrs . Brent abruptly .  Did you ? Who was it ?  Mr . Pearson .  He used to give me candy . Why didnt you call me ?  It is important that we should not be recognized , said his mother . While we stay here we must be exceedingly prudent . Suppose he had called upon us at the hotel and fallen in with Mr . Granville . He might have told him that you are my son , and that your name is Jonas , not Philip .  Then the fat would be in the fire! said Jonas .  Exactly so; I am glad you see the danger . Now I want you to stay here , or in your own room , for the next two or three hours .  Itll be awfully tiresome , grumbled Jonas .  It is necessary , said his mother firmly . Mr . Pearson leaves for New York by an afternoon train . It is now only two oclock . He left the car at Thirteenth Street , and might easily call at this hotel . It is a general rendezvous for visitors to the city . If he should meet you down stairs , he would probably know you , and his curiosity would be aroused . He asked me where I was staying , but I didnt appear to hear the question .  Thats pretty hard on me , ma .  I am out of all patience with you , said Mrs . Brent . Am I not working for your interest , and you are doing all you can to thwart my plans . If you dont care anything about inheriting a large fortune , let it go! We can go back to Gresham and give it all up .  Ill do as you say , ma , said Jonas , subdued .  The very next day Mr . Granville sent for Mrs . Brent . She lost no time in waiting upon him .  Mrs . Brent , he said , I have decided to leave Philadelphia to-morrow .  Are you quite able , sir ? she asked , with a good assumption of sympathy .  My doctor tells me I may venture . We shall travel in Pullman cars , you know . I shall secure a whole compartment , and avail myself of every comfort and luxury which money can command .  Ah , sir! money is a good friend in such a case .  True , Mrs . Brent . I have seen the time when I was poorly supplied with it . Now I am happily at ease . Can you and Philip be ready ?  Yes , Mr . Granville , answered Mrs . Brent promptly . We are ready to-day , for that matter . We shall both be glad to get started .  I am glad to hear it . I think Philip will like his Western home . I bought a fine country estate of a Chicago merchant , whose failure compelled him to part with it . Philip shall have his own horse and his own servants .  He will be delighted , said Mrs . Brent warmly . He has been used to none of these things , for Mr . Brent and I , much as we loved him , had not the means to provide him with such luxuries .  Yes , Mrs . Brent , I understand that fully . You were far from rich . Yet you cared for my boy as if he were your own .  I loved him as much as if he had been my own son , Mr . Granville .  I am sure you did . I thank Providence that I am able to repay to some extent the great debt I have incurred . I cannot repay it wholly , but I will take care that you , too , shall enjoy ease and luxury . You shall have one of the best rooms in my house , and a special servant to wait upon you .  Thank you , Mr . Granville , said Mrs . Brent , her heart filled with proud anticipations of the state in which she should hereafter live . I do not care where you put me , so long as you do not separate me from Philip .  She certainly loves my son! said Mr . Granville to himself . Yet her ordinary manner is cold and constrained , and she does not seem like a woman whose affections would easily be taken captive . Yet Philip seems to have found the way to her heart . It must be because she has had so much care of him . We are apt to love those whom we benefit .  But though Mr . Granville credited Mrs . Brent with an affection for Philip , he was uneasily conscious that the boys return had not brought him the satisfaction and happiness he had fondly anticipated .  To begin with , Philip did not look at all as he had supposed his son would look . He did not look like the Granvilles at all . Indeed , he had an unusually countrified aspect , and his conversation was mingled with rustic phrases which shocked his fathers taste .  I suppose it comes of the way in which he has been brought up and the country boys he has associated with , thought Mr . Granville . Fortunately he is young , and there is time to polish him . As soon as I reach Chicago I will engage a private tutor for him , who shall not only remedy his defects of education , but do what he can to improve my sons manners . I want him to grow up a gentleman .  The next day the three started for Chicago , while Mr . Granvilles real son and heir continued to live at a cheap lodging-house in New York .  The star of Jonas was in the ascendant , while poor Philip seemed destined to years of poverty and hard work . Even now , he was threatened by serious misfortune .    CHAPTER XX .  LEFT OUT IN THE COLD .  Of course Phil was utterly ignorant of the audacious attempt to deprive him of his rights and keep him apart from the father who longed once more to meet him . There was nothing before him so far as he knew except to continue the up-hill struggle for a living .  He gave very little thought to the prediction of the fortune-teller whom he had consulted , and didnt dream of any short-cut to fortune .  Do all he could , he found he could not live on his wages .  His board cost him four dollars a week , and washing and lunch two dollars more , thus compelling him to exceed his salary by a dollar each week .  He had , as we know , a reserve fund , on which he could draw , but it was small , and grew constantly smaller . Then , again , his clothes were wearing out , and he saw no way of obtaining money to buy new .  Phil became uneasy , and the question came up to his mind , Should he write to his step-mother and ask her for a trifling loan ? If the money had been hers , he would not have done so on any condition; but she had had nothing of her own , and all the property in her hands came through Mr . Brent , who , as he knew , was attached to him , even though no tie of blood united them . He certainly meant that Phil should be cared for out of the estate , and at length Phil brought himself to write the following letter:  NEW YORK , March 10 , 18-- .  DEAR MRS . BRENT: I suppose I ought to have written you before , and have no good excuse to offer . I hope you and Jonas are well , and will continue so . Let me tell you how I have succeeded thus far .  I have been fortunate enough to obtain a place in a large mercantile establishment , and for my services I am paid five dollars a week . This is more than boys generally get in the first place , and I am indebted to the partiality of an old gentleman , the senior member of the firm , whom I had the chance to oblige , for faring so well . Still I find it hard to get along on this sum , though I am as economical as possible . My board and washing cost me six dollars a week , and I have , besides , to buy clothing from time to time . I have nearly spent the extra money I had with me , and do not know how to keep myself looking respectable in the way of clothing . Under the circumstances , I shall have to apply to you for a loan , say of twenty-five dollars . In a year or two I hope to earn enough to be entirely independent . At present I cannot expect it . As my father--Mr . Brent--undoubtedly intended to provide for me , I dont think I need to apologize for making this request . Still I do it reluctantly , for I would prefer to depend entirely upon myself .  With regards to you and Jonas , I am yours truly , PHILIP BRENT .    Phil put this letter in the post-office , and patiently waited for an answer .  Mrs . Brent surely cannot refuse me , he said to himself , since I have almost wholly relieved her of the expense of taking care of me .  Phil felt so sure that money would be sent to him that he began to look round a little among ready-made clothing stores to see at what price he could obtain a suit that would do for every-day use . He found a store in the Bowery where he could secure a suit , which looked as if it would answer , for thirteen dollars . If Mrs . Brent sent him twenty-five , that would leave him twelve for underclothing , and for a reserve fund to meet the weekly deficit which he could not avoid .  Three--four days passed , and no letter came in answer to his .  It cant be that Mrs . Brent wont at least answer my letter , he thought uneasily . Even if she didnt send me twenty-five dollars , she couldnt help sending me something .  Still he felt uneasy , in view of the position in which he would find himself in case no letter or remittance should come at all .  It was during this period of anxiety that his heart leaped for joy when on Broadway he saw the familiar form of Reuben Gordon , a young man already mentioned , to whom Phil had sold his gun before leaving Gresham .  Why , Reuben , how are you ? exclaimed Phil joyfully . When did you come to town ?  Phil Brent! exclaimed Reuben , shaking hands heartily . Im thunderin glad to see you . I was thinkin of you only five minutes ago , and wonderin where you hung out .  But you havent told me when you came to New York .  Only this morning! Im goin to stay with a cousin of my fathers , that lives in Brooklyn , over night .  I wanted to ask you about Mrs . Brent and Jonas . I was afraid they might be sick , for I wrote four days ago and havent got any answer yet .  Where did you write to ?  To Gresham , of course , answered Phil , in surprise .  You dont mean to say you haint heard of their leavin Gresham ? said Reuben , in evident astonishment .  Who has left Gresham ?  Your mother--leastwise , Mrs . Brent--and Jonas . They cleared out three weeks ago , and nobodys heard a word of them since--that is , nobody in the village .  Dont you know where theyve gone ? asked Phil , in amazement .  No . I was goin to ask you . I sposed , of course , theyd write and let you know .  I didnt even know they had left Gresham .  Well , thats what I call curus . It aint treatin you right accordin to my ideas .  Is the house shut up ?  It was till two days ago . Then a brother of Mrs . Brent came and opened it . He has brought his wife and one child with him , and it seems theyre goin to live there . Somebody asked him where his sister and Jonas were , but they didnt get no satisfaction . He said he didnt rightly know himself . He believed they was travelin; thought they might be in Canada .  Phil looked and felt decidedly sober at this information . He understood , of course , now , why his letter had not been answered . It looked as if he were an outcast from the home that had been his so long . When he came to New York to earn a living he felt that he was doing so voluntarily , and was not obliged to do so . Now he was absolutely thrown upon his own resources , and must either work or starve .  Theyve treated you real mean , said Reuben .  I never did like Mrs . Brent , or Jonas either , for that matter .  Where are you working ?  Phil answered this question and several others which his honest country friend asked , but his mind was preoccupied , and he answered some of the questions at random . Finally he excused himself on the ground that he must be getting back to the store .  That evening Phil thought seriously of his position . Something must be done , that was very evident . His expenses exceeded his income , and he needed some clothing . There was no chance of getting his wages raised under a year , for he already received more pay than it was customary to give to a boy . What should he do ?  Phil decided to lay his position frankly before the only friend he had in the city likely to help him--Mr . Oliver Carter . The old gentleman had been so friendly and kind that he felt that he would not at any rate repulse him . After he had come to this decision he felt better . He determined to lose no time in calling upon Mr . Carter .  After supper he brushed his hair carefully , and made himself look as well as circumstances would admit . Then he bent his steps toward Twelfth Street , where , as the reader will remember , Mr . Carter lived with his niece .  He ascended the steps and rang the bell . It was opened by Hannah , who recognized him , having admitted him on the former occasion of his calling .  Good-evening , said Phil pleasantly . Is Mr . Carter at home ?  No , sir , answered Hannah . Didnt you know he had gone to Florida ?  Gone to Florida! repeated Phil , his heart sinking . When did he start ?  He started this afternoon .  Whos asking after Uncle Oliver ? asked a boys voice .  Looking behind Hannah , Phil recognized the speaker as Alonzo Pitkin .    CHAPTER XXI .  THEY MET BY CHANCE .  Who was asking after Uncle Oliver ? demanded Alonzo superciliously .  I was , answered Philip .  Oh! its you , is it ? said Alonzo , rather disdainfully .  Yes , answered Phil calmly , though he felt provoked at Alonzos tone , which was meant to be offensive . You remember me , dont you ?  You are the boy that got round Uncle Oliver , and got him to give you a place in pas store .  I deny that I got round him , returned Phil warmly . I had the good luck to do him a favor .  I suppose you have come after money ? said Alonzo coarsely .  I shant ask you for any , at any rate , said Phil angrily .  No; it wouldnt do any good , said Alonzo; and its no use asking ma , either . She says you are an adventurer , and have designs on Uncle Oliver because he is rich .  I shall not ask your mother for any favor , said Phil , provoked . I am sorry not to meet your uncle .  I dare say! sneered Alonzo .  Just then a woman , poorly but neatly dressed , came down stairs . Her face was troubled . Just behind her came Mrs . Pitkin , whose face wore a chilly and proud look .  Mr . Carter has left the city , and I really dont know when he will return , Phil heard her say . If he had been at home , it would not have benefited you . He is violently prejudiced against you , and would not have listened to a word you had to say .  I did not think he would have harbored resentment so long , murmured the poor woman . He never seemed to me to be a hard man .  Phil gazed at the poorly dressed woman with a surprise which he did not attempt to conceal , for in her he recognized the familiar figure of his landlady . What could she have to do in this house ? he asked himself .  Mrs . Forbush! he exclaimed .  Philip! exclaimed Mrs . Forbush , in a surprise as great as his own , for she had never asked where her young lodger worked , and was not aware that he was in the employ of her cousins husband and well acquainted with the rich uncle whom she had not seen for years .  Do you know each other ? demanded Mrs . Pitkin , whose turn it was to be surprised .  This young gentleman lodges in my house , answered Mrs . Forbush .  Young gentleman! repeated Alonzo , with a mocking laugh .  Philip looked at him sternly . He had his share of human nature , and it would have given him satisfaction to thrash the insolent young patrician , as Alonzo chose to consider himself .  And what do you want here , young man ? asked Mrs . Pitkin in a frosty tone , addressing Phil of course .  I wished to see Mr . Carter , answered Phil .  Really , Mr . Carter seems to be very much in request! sneered Mrs . Pitkin . No doubt he will be very much disappointed when he hears what he has lost . You will have to go to Florida to see him , I think , however . She added , after a pause: It will not be well for either of you to call again . Mr . Carter will understand the motive of your calls .  How cruel you are , Lavinia! said Mrs . Forbush sadly .  My name is Mrs . Pitkin! said that lady frigidly .  You have not forgotten that we are cousins , surely ?  I do not care to remember it , Mrs . Forbush . Good-day .  There was no alternative but for Mrs . Forbush to say good-day also , and to descend the steps .  Philip joined her in the street .  Are you really the cousin of Mrs . Pitkin ? he asked .  Yes , answered Mrs . Forbush . I bear the same relationship to Mr . Carter that she does . We were much together as girls , and were both educated at the same expensive schools . I offended my relatives by marrying Mr . Forbush , whose fault was that he was poor , and chiefly , I think , through the efforts of Lavinia Pitkin I was cast out by the family . But where did you meet Uncle Oliver ?  Philip explained the circumstances already known to the reader .  Mr . Carter seems to me to be a kind-hearted man , he said . I dont believe he would have cast you off if he had not been influenced by other parties .  So I think , said Mrs . Forbush . I will tell you , she continued , after a pause , what drew me here this afternoon . I am struggling hard to keep my head above water , Mr . Brent , but I find it hard to meet my expenses . I cannot meet my rent due to-morrow within fifteen dollars , and I dared to hope that if I could meet Uncle Oliver face to face and explain matters to him , he would let me have the money .  I am sure he would , said Phil warmly .  But he is in Florida , and will probably remain there for a month or two at least , said Mrs . Forbush , sighing . But even if he were in the city I suppose Lavinia would do all in her power to keep us apart .  I have no doubt she would , Mrs . Forbush . Though she is your cousin , I dislike her very much .  I suppose the boy with whom you were talking was her son Alonzo ?  Yes; he is about the most disagreeable boy I ever met . Both he and his mother seem very much opposed to my having an interview with your uncle .  Lavinia was always of a jealous and suspicious disposition , said Mrs . Forbush . I have not seen Alonzo since he was a baby . He is two years older than my Julia . He was born before I estranged my relatives by marrying a poor man .  What are you going to do , Mrs . Forbush , about the rent ? asked Phil , in a tone of sympathy .  I dont know . I shall try to get the landlord to wait , but I dont know how he will feel about it .  I wish I had plenty of money . I would gladly lend you all you need .  I am sure you would , Philip , said Mrs . Forbush . The offer does me good , though it is not accompanied by the ability to do what your good heart dictates . I feel that I am not without friends .  I am a very poor one , said Phil . The fact is , I am in trouble myself . My income is only five dollars a week , and my expenses are beyond that . I dont know how I am going to keep up .  You may stay with me for three dollars a week , if you cannot pay four , said Mrs . Forbush , forgetting her own troubles in her sympathy with our hero .  No , Mrs . Forbush , you cant afford it . You need money as much as I do , and perhaps more; for you have more than yourself to support .  Yes , poor Julia! sighed the mother . She is born to a heritage of poverty . Heaven only knows how we are going to get along .  God will provide for us , Mrs . Forbush , said Philip . I dont know how it is , but in spite of my troubles I feel cheerful . I have a confidence that things will come out well , though I cannot possibly imagine how .  You are young , and youth is more inclined to be hopeful than maturer years . However , I do not wish to dampen your cheerfulness . Keep it , and let it comfort you .  If Phil could have heard the conversation that took place between Mrs . Pitkin and Alonzo after their departure , he might have felt less hopeful .  It is dreadfully annoying that that woman should turn up after all these years! said Mrs . Pitkin , in a tone of disgust .  Is she really your cousin , ma ? asked Alonzo .  Yes , but she disgraced herself by a low marriage , and was cast off .  That disposes of her , then ?  I dont know . If she could meet Uncle Oliver , I am afraid she would worm herself into his confidence and get him to do something for her . Then it is unfortunate that she and that boy have fallen in with each other . She may get him to speak to Uncle Oliver in her behalf .  Isnt he working for pa ?  Yes .  Why dont you get pa to discharge him while Uncle Oliver is away ?  Well thought of , Alonzo! I will speak to your father this very evening .    CHAPTER XXII .  PHIL IS BOUNCED .  Saturday , as is usual in such establishments , was pay-day at the store of Phils employers . The weeks wages were put up in small envelopes and handed to the various clerks .  When Phil went up to the cashier to get his money he put it quietly into his vest-pocket .  Daniel Dickson , the cashier , observing this , said:  Brent , you had better open your envelope .  Rather surprised , Phil nevertheless did as requested .  In the envelope , besides the five-dollar bill representing his weeks salary , he found a small slip of paper , on which was written these ominous words:  Your services will not be required after this week . Appended to this notice was the name of the firm .  Phil turned pale , for to him , embarrassed as he was , the loss of his place was a very serious matter .  What does this mean , Mr . Dickson ? he asked quickly .  I cant inform you , answered the cashier , smiling unpleasantly , for he was a selfish man who sympathized with no one , and cared for no one as long as he himself remained prosperous .  Who handed you this paper ? asked Phil .  The boss .  Mr . Pitkin ?  Of course .  Mr . Pitkin was still in his little office , and Phil made his way directly to him .  May I speak to you , sir ? asked our hero .  Be quick about it then , for I am in a hurry , answered Pitkin , in a very forbidding tone .  Why am I discharged , sir ?  I cant go into details . We dont need you any longer .  Are you not satisfied with me ?  No! said Pitkin brusquely .  In what respect have I failed to satisfy you , sir ?  Dont put on any airs , boy! returned Pitkin . We dont want you , thats all .  You might have given me a little notice , said Phil indignantly .  We made no stipulation of that kind , I believe .  It would only be fair , sir .  No impertinence , young man! I wont stand it! I dont need any instructions as to the manner of conducting my business .  Phil by this time perceived that his discharge was decided upon without any reference to the way in which he had performed his duties , and that any discussion or remonstrance would be unavailing .  I see , sir , that you have no regard for justice , and will leave you , he said .  Youd better , and without delay! said Pitkin irascibly .  Phil emerged upon the street with a sinking heart . His available funds consisted only of the money he had just received and seventy-five cents in change , and what he was to do he did not know . He walked home with slow steps , looking sad in spite of his usually hopeful temperament .  When he entered the house he met Mrs . Forbush in the hall . She at once noticed his gravity .  Have you had any bad luck , Philip ? she asked .  Yes , answered Phil . I have lost my situation .  Indeed! returned the landlady , with quick sympathy . Have you had any difficulty with your employer ?  Not that I am aware of .  Did he assign any reason for your discharge ?  No; I asked him for an explanation , but he merely said I was not wanted any longer .  Isnt there any chance of his taking you back ?  I am sure there is not .  Dont be discouraged , Philip . A smart boy like you wont be long out of a place . Meanwhile you are welcome to stay here as long as I have a roof to cover me .  Thank you , Mrs . Forbush , said Phil warmly , you are a true friend . You are in trouble yourself , yet you stand by me!  I have had a stroke of good luck to-day , said Mrs . Forbush cheerfully . A former boarder , whom I allowed to remain here for five or six weeks when he was out of employment , has sent me thirty dollars in payment of his bill , from Boston , where he found a position . So I shall be able to pay my rent and have something over . I have been lucky , and so may you .  Phil was cheered by the ready sympathy of his landlady , and began to take a more cheerful view of matters .  I will go out bright and early on Monday and see if I cant find another place , he said . Perhaps it may be all for the best .  Yet on the day succeeding he had some sober hours . How differently he had been situated only three months before . Then he had a home and relatives . Now he was practically alone in the world , with no home in which he could claim a share , and he did not even know where his step-mother and Jonas were . Sunday forenoon he attended church , and while he sat within its sacred precincts his mind was tranquilized , and his faith and cheerfulness increased .  On Monday he bought the Herald , and made a tour of inquiry wherever he saw that a boy was wanted . But in each place he was asked if he could produce a recommendation from his last employer . He decided to go back to his old place and ask for one , though he was very reluctant to ask a favor of any kind from a man who had treated him so shabbily as Mr . Pitkin . It seemed necessary , however , and he crushed down his pride and made his way to Mr . Pitkins private office .  Mr . Pitkin! he said .  You here! exclaimed Pitkin , scowling . You neednt ask to be taken back . Its no use .  I dont ask it , answered Phil .  Then what are you here for ?  I would like a letter of recommendation , that I may obtain another place .  Well , well! said Pitkin , wagging his head . If that isnt impudence .  What is impudence ? asked Phil . I did as well as I could , and that I am ready to do for another employer . But all ask me for a letter from you .  You wont get any! said Pitkin abruptly .  Where is your home ?  I have none except in this city .  Where did you come from ?  From the country .  Then I advise you to go back there . You may do for the country . You are out of place in the city .  Poor Phil! Things did indeed look dark for him . Without a letter of recommendation from Mr . Pitkin it would be almost impossible for him to secure another place , and how could he maintain himself in the city ? He didnt wish to sell papers or black boots , and those were about the only paths now open to him .  I am having a rough time! he thought , but I will try not to get discouraged .  He turned upon his heel and walked out of the store .  As he passed the counter where Wilbur was standing , the young man said:  I am awfully sorry , Philip . Its a shame! If I wasnt broke Id offer to lend you a fiver .  Thank you all the same for your kind offer , Wilbur , said Phil .  Come round and see me .  So I will--soon .  He left the store and wandered aimlessly about the streets .  Four days later , sick with hope deferred , he made his way down to the wharf of the Charleston and Savannah boats , with a vague idea that he might get a job of carrying baggage , for he felt that he must not let his pride interfere with doing anything by which he could earn an honest penny .  It so happened that the Charleston boat was just in , and the passengers were just landing .  Phil stood on the pier and gazed listlessly at them as they disembarked .  All at once he started in surprise , and his heart beat joyfully .  There , just descending the gang-plank , was his tried friend , Mr . Oliver Carter , whom he supposed over a thousand miles away in Florida .  Mr . Carter! exclaimed Phil , dashing forward .  Philip! exclaimed the old gentleman , much surprised . How came you here ? Did Mr . Pitkin send you ?     CHAPTER XXIII .  AN EXPLANATION .  It would be hard to tell which of the two was the more surprised at the meeting , Philip or Mr . Carter .  I dont understand how Mr . Pitkin came to hear of my return . I didnt telegraph , said the old gentleman .  I dont think he knows anything about it , said Phil .  Didnt he send you to the pier ?  No , sir .  Then how is it that you are not in the store at this time ? asked Mr . Carter , puzzled .  Because I am no longer in Mr . Pitkins employ . I was discharged last Saturday .  Discharged! What for ?  Mr . Pitkin gave no reason . He said my services were no longer required . He spoke roughly to me , and has since declined to give me a recommendation , though I told him that without it I should be unable to secure employment elsewhere .  Mr . Carter frowned . He was evidently annoyed and indignant .  This must be inquired into , he said . Philip , call a carriage , and I will at once go to the Astor House and take a room . I had intended to go at once to Mr . Pitkins , but I shall not do so until I have had an explanation of this outrageous piece of business .  Phil was rejoiced to hear this , for he was at the end of his resources , and the outlook for him was decidedly gloomy . He had about made up his mind to sink his pride and go into business as a newsboy the next day , but the very unexpected arrival of Mr . Carter put quite a new face on matters .  He called a carriage , and both he and Mr . Carter entered it .  How do you happen to be back so soon , sir ? asked Phil , when they were seated . I thought you were going to Florida for a couple of months .  I started with that intention , but on reaching Charleston I changed my mind . I expected to find some friends at St . Augustine , but I learned that they were already returning to the North , and I felt that I should be lonely and decided to return . I am very glad I did , now . Did you receive my letter ?  Your letter ? queried Philip , looking at Mr . Carter in surprise .  Certainly . I gave Alonzo a letter for you , which I had directed to your boarding-house , and requested him to mail it . It contained a ten-dollar bill .  I never received any such letter , sir . It would have been of great service to me--the money , I mean; for I have found it hard to live on five dollars a week . Now I have not even that .  Is it possible that Alonzo could have suppressed the letter ? said Mr . Carter to himself .  At any rate I never received it .  Here is something else to inquire into , said Mr . Carter . If Alonzo has tampered with my letter , perhaps appropriated the money , it will be the worse for him .  I hardly think he would do that , sir; though I dont like him .  You are generous; but I know the boy better than you do . He is fond of money , not for the sake of spending it , but for the sake of hoarding it . Tell me , then , how did you learn that I had gone to Florida ?  I learned it at the house in Twelfth Street .  Then you called there ?  Yes , sir; I called to see you . I found it hard to get along on my salary , and I did not want Mrs . Forbush to lose by me , so I----  Mrs . Forbush ? repeated the old gentleman quickly . That name sounds familiar to me .  Mrs . Forbush is your niece , said Phil , a hope rising in his heart that he might be able to do his kind landlady a good turn .  Did she tell you that ?  No , sir; that is , I was ignorant of it until I met her just as I was going away from Mrs . Pitkins .  Did she call there , too--to see me ? asked the old gentleman .  Yes , sir; but she got a very cold reception . Mrs . Pitkin was very rude to her , and said that you were so much prejudiced against her that she had better not call again .  Thats like her cold selfishness . I understand her motives very well . I had no idea that Mrs . Forbush was in the city . Is she--poor ?  Yes , sir; she is having a hard struggle to maintain herself and her daughter .  And you board at her house ?  Yes , sir .  How strangely things come about! She is as nearly related to me as Lavinia--Mrs . Pitkin .  She told me so .  She married against the wishes of her family , but I can see now that we were all unreasonably prejudiced against her . Lavinia , however , trumped up stories against her husband , which I am now led to believe were quite destitute of foundation , and did all she could to keep alive the feud . I feel now that I was very foolish to lend myself to her selfish ends . Of course her object was to get my whole fortune for herself and her boy .  Phil had no doubt of this , but he did not like to say so , for it would seem that he , too , was influenced by selfish motives .  Then you are not so much prejudiced against Mrs . Forbush as she was told ? he allowed himself to say .  No , no! said Mr . Carter earnestly . Poor Rebecca! She has a much better nature and disposition than Mrs . Pitkin . And you say she is poor ?  She had great difficulty in paying her last months rent , said Philip .  Where does she live ?  Phil told him .  What sort of a house is it ?  It isnt a brown-stone front , answered Phil , smiling . It is a poor , cheap house; but it is as good as she can afford to hire .  And you like her ?  Very much , Mr . Carter . She has been very kind to me , and though she finds it so hard to get along , she has told me she will keep me as long as she has a roof over her head , though just now I cannot pay my board , because my income is gone .  It will come back again , Philip , said the old gentleman .  Phil understood by this that he would be restored to his place in Mr . Pitkins establishment . This did not yield him unalloyed satisfaction , for he was sure that it would be made unpleasant for him by Mr . Pitkin . Still he would accept it , and meet disagreeable things as well as he could .  By this time they had reached the Astor House .  Phil jumped out first , and assisted Mr . Carter to descend .  He took Mr . Carters hand-bag , and followed him into the hotel .  Mr . Carter entered his name in the register .  What is your name ? he asked--Philip Brent ?  Yes , sir .  I will enter your name , too .  Am I to stay here ? asked Phil , in surprise .  Yes; I shall need a confidential clerk , and for the present you will fill that position . I will take two adjoining rooms--one for you .  Phil listened in surprise .  Thank you , sir , he said .  Mr . Carter gave orders to have his trunk sent for from the steamer , and took possession of the room . Philips room was smaller , but considerably more luxurious than the one he occupied at the house of Mrs . Forbush .  Have you any money , Philip ? asked the old gentleman .  I have twenty-five cents , answered Philip .  That isnt a very large sum , said Mr . Carter , smiling . Here , let me replenish your pocketbook .  He drew four five-dollar bills from his wallet and handed them to Phil .  How can I thank you , sir ? asked Phil gratefully .  Wait till you have more to thank me for . Let me tell you this , that in trying to harm you , Mr . and Mrs . Pitkin have done you a great service .  I should like to see Mrs . Forbush this evening , if you can spare me , to let her know that she neednt be anxious about me .  By all means . You can go .  Am I at liberty to mention that I have seen you , sir ?  Yes . Tell her that I will call to-morrow . And you may take her this .  Mr . Carter drew a hundred-dollar bill from his wallet and passed it to Phil .  Get it changed at the office as you go out , he said . Come back as soon as you can .  With a joyful heart Phil jumped on a Fourth Avenue car in front of the hotel , and started on his way up town .    CHAPTER XXIV .  RAISING THE RENT .  Leaving Phil , we will precede him to the house of Mrs . Forbush .  She had managed to pay the rent due , but she was not out of trouble . The time had come when it was necessary to decide whether she would retain the house for the following year . In New York , as many of my young readers may know , the first of May is moving-day , and leases generally begin at that date . Engagements are made generally by or before March 1st .  Mr . Stone , the landlord , called upon the widow to ascertain whether she proposed to remain in the house .  I suppose I may as well do so , said Mrs . Forbush .  She had had difficulty in making her monthly payments , but to move would involve expense , and it might be some time before she could secure boarders in a new location .  You cant do better , said the landlord . At fifty dollars a month this is a very cheap house .  You mean forty-five ? Mr . Stone ? said Mrs . Forbush .  No , I dont , said the landlord .  But that is what I have been paying this last year .  That is true , but I ought to get fifty dollars , and if you wont pay it somebody else will .  Mr . Stone , said the widow , in a troubled voice , I hope you will be considerate . It has been as much as I could do to get together forty-five dollars each month to pay you . Indeed , I can pay no more .  Pardon me for saying that that is no affair of mine , said the landlord brusquely . If you cant pay the rent , by all means move into a smaller house . If you stay here you must be prepared to pay fifty dollars a month .  I dont see how I can , answered the widow in dejection .  Ill give you three days to consider it , said the landlord indifferently . Youll make a mistake if you give the house up . However , that is your affair .  The landlord left the house , and Mrs . Forbush sat down depressed .  Julia , she said to her daughter , I wish you were old enough to advise me . I dislike to move , but I dont dare to engage to pay such a rent . Fifty dollars a month will amount to----  Six hundred dollars a year! said Julia , who was good at figures .  And that seems a great sum to us .  It would be little enough to Mrs . Pitkin , said Julia , who felt that ladys prosperity unjust , while her poor , patient mother had to struggle so hard for a scanty livelihood .  Oh , yes; Lavinia is rolling in wealth , sighed Mrs . Forbush . I cant understand how Uncle Oliver can bestow his favors on so selfish a woman .  Why dont you ask Philips advice about keeping the house ? said Julia .  It must be explained that Philip and Julia were already excellent friends , and it may be said that each was mutually attracted by the other .  Poor Philip has his own troubles , said Mrs . Forbush . He has lost his place through the malice and jealousy of Mr . and Mrs . Pitkin , for I am sure that Lavinia is the cause of his dismissal , and I dont know when he will be able to get another .  You wont send him away , mother , if he cant pay his board ?  No , answered her mother warmly . Philip is welcome to stay with us as long as we have a roof over our heads , whether he can pay his board or not .  This answer seemed very satisfactory to Julia , who rose impulsively and kissed her mother .  Thats a good mother , she said . It would be a pity to send poor Philip into the street .  You seem to like Philip , said Mrs . Forbush , smiling faintly .  Yes , mother . You know I havent any brother , and Phil seems just like a brother to me .  Just then the door opened , and Philip himself entered the room .  Generally he came home looking depressed , after a long and ineffectual search for employment . Now he was fairly radiant with joy .  Phil , youve got a place; I know you have! exclaimed Julia , noticing his glad expression . Where is it ? Is it a good one ?  Have you really got a place , Philip ? asked Mrs . Forbush .  Yes , for the present .  Do you think you shall like your employer ?  He is certainly treating me very well , said Phil , smiling . He has paid me twenty dollars in advance .  Then the age of wonders has not passed , said the widow . Of course I believe you , Philip , but it seems extraordinary .  There is something more extraordinary to come , said Phil . He has sent you some money , too .  Me! exclaimed Mrs . Forbush , in great surprise .  What can he know about me ?  I told him about you .  But we are strangers .  He used to know you , and still feels an interest in you , Mrs . Forbush .  Who can it be ? said the widow , looking bewildered .  I dont want to keep you in suspense any longer , so I may as well say that it is your Uncle Oliver .  Uncle Oliver! Why , he is in Florida .  No; he came home from Charleston . I happened to be at the pier--I went down to see if I could get a job at smashing baggage--when I saw him walking down the gang-plank .  Has he gone to his old quarters at Mr . Pitkins ?  No; what I told about the way they treated you and me made him angry , and he drove to the Astor House . I have a room there , too , and am to act as his private secretary .  So that is your new situation , Phil ? said Julia .  Yes , and it is a good one .  And he really feels kindly to me ? said Mrs . Forbush hopefully .  He sends you this and will call to-morrow , said Phil . Actions speak louder than words . There are a hundred dollars in this roll of bills .  He sent all this to me ? she said .  Yes , and of his own accord . It was no suggestion of mine .  Julia , said Mrs . Forbush , turning to her daughter , I believe God has heard my prayer , and that better days are in store for all of us .  Philip included , added Phil , smiling .  Yes . I want you to share in our good fortune .  Mother , you had better consult Phil about keeping the house .  Oh , yes .  Mrs . Forbush thereupon told Philip of the landlords visit and his proposal to ask a higher rent .  I hesitated about taking the house , she said; but with this handsome gift from Uncle Oliver , I dont know but I may venture . What do you think ?  I think , Mrs . Forbush , you had better not decide till you have seen your uncle . He may have some plan of his own for you . At any rate , you had better consult him . He will call to-morrow . And now , let me pay you for my weeks board .  No , Philip . I shall not want it with all this money , which I should not have received but for you .  A debt is a debt , Mrs . Forbush , and I prefer to pay it . I shall not be here to supper , as Mr . Carter is expecting me back to the Astor House . I shall probably come with him when he calls upon you to-morrow .  On his return to the hotel , as he was walking on Broadway , Phil came face to face with Alonzo Pitkin .  I think Ill ask him about that letter his uncle gave him to post to me , thought Phil , and he waited until Alonzo was close at hand .    CHAPTER XXV .  ALONZO IS PUZZLED .  Alonzo , who had his share of curiosity , as soon as he saw Phils approach , determined to speak to him , and ascertain what were his plans and what he was doing . With the petty malice which he inherited from his mother , he hoped that Phil had been unable to find a place and was in distress .  It would serve him right , said Alonzo to himself , for trying to get into Uncle Olivers good graces . I spose he would like to cut me out , but hell find that he cant fight against ma and me .  Oh , its you , is it ? was Alonzos salutation when they met .  Yes , answered Phil .  Pa bounced you , didnt he ? continued Alonzo complacently .  Yes , answered Phil . That is , he discharged me . I suppose that is what you meant .  Youve got it right the first time , said Alonzo .  Have you got another place ?  Do you ask because you feel interested in me ? asked Phil .  Well , not particularly , answered Alonzo appearing quite amused by the suggestion .  Then you ask out of curiosity ?  Spose I do ?  I dont mind telling you that I have found a place , then .  What sort of a place ? asked Alonzo , disappointed .  There is no need of going into particulars .  No . I spose not , sneered Alonzo . Youre probably selling papers or blacking boots .  You are mistaken . I have a much better situation than I had with your father .  Alonzos lower jaw fell . He was very sorry to hear it .  Didnt your employer ask for a recommendation ?  He didnt seem to think one necessary! replied Phil .  If hed known pa had sacked you , he wouldnt have wanted you , I guess .  He knows it . Have you got through asking questions , Alonzo ?  You are too familiar . You can call me Mr . Pitkin .  Phil laughed at Alonzos assumption of dignity , but made no comment upon it .  I want to ask you what you did with that letter Mr . Carter gave you to post for me ? asked Phil .  Alonzo was indeed surprised , not to say dismayed . The truth was that , judging from the feel of the letter , it contained money , and he had opened it and appropriated the money to his own use . Moreover he had the bank-note in his pocket at that very moment , not having any wish to spend , but rather to hoard it .  Thats a queer question , he stammered . What letter do you refer to ?  A letter Mr . Carter gave you to mail to me .  If he gave me any such letter I mailed it , answered Alonzo , scarcely knowing what to say .  I didnt receive it .  How do you know he gave me any letter ? demanded Alonzo , puzzled .  I dont care to tell . I only know that there was such a letter handed to you . Do you know what was in it ?  Writing , I spose , said Alonzo flippantly .  Yes , there was , but there was also a ten-dollar bill . I didnt receive the letter , and Phil fixed his eyes searchingly upon the face of Alonzo .  Thats a pretty story! said Alonzo . I dont believe Uncle Oliver would be such a fool as to send you ten dollars . If he did , you got it , and now want to get as much more , pretending you havent received it .  You are mistaken , said Phil quietly .  If you didnt get the letter , how do you know any was written , and that there was anything in it ? asked Alonzo triumphantly , feeling that the question was a crusher .  I dont care to tell you how I know it . Do you deny it ?  I dont remember whether Uncle Oliver gave me any letter or not .  Will you be kind enough to give me his address in Florida , so that I may write to him and find out ?  No , I wont , said Alonzo angrily , and I think you are very cheeky to ask such a thing . Ma was right when she said that you were the most impudent boy she ever came across .  Thats enough , Alonzo , said Phil quietly . Ive found out all I wanted to .  What have you found out ? asked Alonzo , his tone betraying some apprehension .  Never mind . I think I know what became of that letter .  Do you mean to say I opened it and took out the money ? demanded Alonzo , reddening .  I wouldnt charge anybody with such a mean act , unless I felt satisfied of it .  Youd better not! said Alonzo , in a bullying tone . If I find out who youre working for , Ill let him know that pa bounced you .  Just as you please! I dont think that any words of yours will injure me with the gentleman I have the good fortune to work for .  Dont you be too sure! If you think he wouldnt mind a boy , Ill refer him to pa and ma . Theyll give you a good setting out .  I dont doubt it , said Phil indifferently , and turned to go away .  He was called back by Alonzo , who had not quite satisfied his curiosity .  Say , are you boarding with that woman who came to see ma the same day you were at the house ? he asked .  No; I have left her .  Alonzo looked well pleased . He knew that his mother felt rather uneasy at the two being together , dreading lest they should make a concerted attempt to ingratiate themselves with her rich uncle .  Ma says she behaved very badly , Alonzo could not help adding .  Mrs . Forbush is an excellent Lady , said Phil warmly , for he could not hear one of his friends spoken against .  Lady! Shes as poor as poverty , sneered Alonzo .  She is none the worse for that .  Uncle Oliver cant bear her!  Indeed! said Phil; pausing to see what else Alonzo would say .  Ma says she disgraced herself , and all her relations gave her up . When you see her tell her she had better not come sneaking round the house again .  If you will write a letter to that effect , I will see that she gets it , said Phil . That letter wont miscarry .  I dont care to take any notice of her , said Alonzo loftily .  You are very kind to have wasted so much notice upon me , said Phil , amused .  Alonzo did not see fit to answer this , but walked away with his head in the air . He was , however , not quite easy in mind .  How in the world , he asked himself , could that boy have found out that Uncle Oliver gave me a letter to post ? If he should learn that I opened it and took the money , thered be a big fuss . I guess Id better not meet him again . If I see him any day Ill go in a different direction . Hes so artful he may get me into trouble .  It is needless to say that neither Mr . or Mrs . Pitkin knew of Alonzos tampering with the letter . Much as they would have been opposed to Phils receiving such a letter , they would have been too wise to sanction such a bold step .  Well , said Mr . Carter , when Phil returned , did you see Rebecca--Mrs . Forbush ?  Yes , sir , and handed her the money . She was overjoyed; not so much at receiving so generous a sum as at learning that you were reconciled to her .  Poor girl! said the old man , forgetting that she was now a worn woman . I am afraid that she must have suffered much .  She has met with many hardships , sir , but she wont mind them now .  If I live her future shall be brighter than her past . I will call to-morrow . You , Philip , shall go with me .  I should like to do so , sir . By the way , I met Alonzo on Broadway .  He detailed the conversation that had taken place between them .  I am afraid he took the money , said Mr . Carter . I am sorry any relative of mine should have acted in that way . Let him keep it . Any benefit he may derive from it will prove to have been dearly purchased .    CHAPTER XXVI .  A WONDERFUL CHANGE .  You may order a carriage , Philip , said Mr . Carter the next morning . Pick out a handsome one with seats for four .  Yes , sir .  In five minutes the carriage was at the door .  Now , Philip , we will go to see my long-neglected niece , Mrs . Forbush . Give the driver the necessary directions .  Mrs . Forbush does not have many carriage-callers , said Philip , smiling .  Perhaps she will have more hereafter , said Mr . Carter , I ought not so long to have lost sight of her . I always liked Rebecca better than Lavinia , yet I let the latter prejudice me against her cousin , who is in disposition , education and sincerity her superior . You see , Philip , there are old fools in the world as well as young ones .  It is never too late to mend , Mr . Carter , said Phil , smiling .  Thats very true , even if it is a young philosopher who says it .  I dont claim any originality for it , Mr . Carter .  By the way , Philip , I have noticed that you always express yourself very correctly . Your education must be good .  Yes , sir , thanks to my father , or the man whom I always regarded as my father . I am a fair Latin scholar , and know something of Greek .  Were you preparing for college ? asked Mr . Carter , with interest .  Yes , sir .  Would you like to go ?  I should have gone had father lived , but my step-mother said it was foolishness and would be money thrown away .  Perhaps she preferred to incur that expense for her own son ? suggested the old gentleman .  Jonas wouldnt consent to that . He detests study , and would decidedly object to going to college .  By the way , you havent heard from them lately ?  Only that they have left our old home and gone no one knows where .  That is strange .  By this time they had reached the humble dwelling occupied by Mrs . Forbush .  And so this is where Rebecca lives ? said Mr . Carter .  Yes , sir . It is not quite so nice as Mrs . Pitkins .  No , returned Mr . Carter thoughtfully .  Philip rang the bell , and the two were admitted into the humble parlor . They had not long to wait for Mrs . Forbush , who , with an agitation which she could not overcome , entered the presence of her long estranged and wealthy uncle .  Rebecca! exclaimed the old gentleman , rising , and showing some emotion as he saw the changes which fifteen years had made in the niece whom he had last met as a girl .  Uncle Oliver! how kind you are to visit me! cried Mrs . Forbush , the tears starting from her eyes .  Kind! Nonsense! I have been very unkind to neglect you so long . But it wasnt all my fault . There were others who did all they could to keep us apart . You have lost your husband ?  Yes , uncle . He was poor , but he was one of the kindest and best of men , and made me happy .  I begin to think I have been an old fool , Rebecca . Philip thinks so , too .  Oh , Mr . Carter! exclaimed our hero .  Yes , you do , Philip , asserted Mr . Carter , and you are quite right . However , as you told me , it is never too late to mend .  Mrs . Forbush will think I take strange liberties with you , sir .  I dont object to good advice , even from a boy . But who is this ?  Julia had just entered the room . She was a bright , attractive girl , but held back bashfully until her mother said:  Julia , this is Uncle Oliver Carter . You have heard me speak of him .  Yes , mamma .  And scold about him , I dare say . Well , Julia , come and give your old uncle a kiss .  Julia blushed , but obeyed her uncles request .  I should know she was your child , Rebecca . She looks as you did at her age . Now tell me , have you any engagement this morning , you two ?  No , Uncle Oliver .  Then I will find one for you . I have a carriage at the door . You will please put on your bonnets . We are going shopping .  Shopping ?  Yes , I am going to fit out both of you in a manner more befitting relatives of mine . The fact is , Niece Rebecca , you are actually shabby .  I know it , uncle , but there has been so many ways of spending money that I have had to neglect my dress .  Very likely . I understand . Things are different now . Now , dont be over an hour getting ready!  We are not fashionable , uncle , said Mrs . Forbush , and we havent any change to make .  They entered the carriage , and drove to a large and fashionable store , where everything necessary to a ladys toilet , including dresses quite complete , could be obtained . Mrs . Forbush was in favor of selecting very plain articles , but her uncle overruled her , and pointed out costumes much more costly .  But , uncle , objected Mrs . Forbush , these things wont at all correspond with our plain home and mode of living . Think of a boarding-house keeper arrayed like a fine lady .  You are going to give up taking boarders--that is , you will have none but Philip and myself .  Will you really live with us , uncle ? But the house is too poor .  Of course it is , but you are going to move . I will speak further on this point when you are through your purchases .  At length the shopping was over , and they re-entered the carriage .  Drive to No .-- Madison Avenue , said Mr . Carter to the driver .  Uncle Oliver , you have given the wrong direction .  No , Rebecca , I know what I am about .  Do you live on Madison Avenue ? asked Mrs . Forbush .  I am going to and so are you . You must know that I own a furnished house on Madison Avenue . The late occupants sailed for Europe last week , and I was looking out for a tenant when I found you . You will move there to-morrow , and act as house keeper , taking care of Philip and myself . I hope Julia and you will like it as well as your present home .  How can I thank you for all your kindness , Uncle Oliver ? said Mrs . Forbush , with joyful tears . It will be living once more . It will be such a rest from the hard struggle I have had of late years .  You can repay me by humoring all my whims , said Uncle Oliver , smiling . You will find me very tyrannical . The least infraction of my rules will lead me to send you all packing .  Am I to be treated in the same way , Mr . Carter ? asked Philip .  Exactly .  Then , if you discharge me , I will fly for refuge to Mr . Pitkin .  That will be out of the frying-pan into the fire with a vengeance .  By this time they had reached the house . It was an elegant brown-stone front , and proved , on entrance , to be furnished in the most complete and elegant manner . Mr . Carter selected the second floor for his own use; a good-sized room on the third was assigned to Philip , and Mrs . Forbush was told to select such rooms for Julia and herself as she desired .  This is much finer than Mrs . Pitkins house , said Philip .  Yes , it is .  She will be jealous when she hears of it .  No doubt . That is precisely what I desire . It will be a fitting punishment for her treatment of her own cousin .  It was arranged that on the morrow Mrs . Forbush and Julia should close their small house , leaving directions to sell the humble furniture at auction , while Mr . Carter and Philip would come up from the Astor House .  What will the Pitkins say when they hear of it ? thought Philip . I am afraid they will feel bad .    CHAPTER XXVII .  AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE .  While these important changes were occurring in the lives of Philip Brent and the poor cousin , Mrs . Pitkin remained in blissful ignorance of what was going on . Alonzo had told her of his encounter with Phil on Broadway and the intelligence our hero gave him of his securing a place .  You may rest assured the boy was lying , Lonny , said Mrs . Pitkin . Boys dont get places so easily , especially when they cant give a recommendation from their last employer .  Thats just what I thought , ma , said Alonzo .  Still Phil looked in good spirits , and he was as saucy as ever .  I can believe the last very well , Lonny . The boy is naturally impertinent . They were probably put on to deceive you .  But how does he get money to pay his way ? said Alonzo puzzled .  As to that , he is probably selling papers or blacking boots in the lower part of the city . He could make enough to live on , and of course he wouldnt let you know what he was doing .  I hope youre right , ma . Id give ever so much to catch him blacking boots in City Hall Park , or anywhere else; Id give him a job . Wouldnt he feel mortified to be caught ?  No doubt he would .  Ive a great mind to go down town to-morrow and look about for him .  Very well , Lonny . You may to if you want to .  Alonzo did go; but he looked in vain for Phil . The latter was employed in doing some writing and attending to some accounts for Mr . Carter , who had by this time found that his protege was thoroughly well qualified for such work .  So nearly a week passed . It so chanced that though Uncle Oliver had now been in New York a considerable time , not one of the Pitkins had met him or had reason to suspect that he was nearer than Florida .  One day , however , among Mrs . Pitkins callers was Mrs . Vangriff , a fashionable acquaintance .  Mr . Oliver Carter is your uncle , I believe ? said the visitor .  Yes .  I met him on Broadway the other day . He was looking very well .  It must have been a fortnight since , then . Uncle Oliver is in Florida .  In Florida! repeated Mrs . Vangriff , in surprise .  When did he go ?  When was it , Lonny ? asked Mrs . Pitkin , appealing to her son .  It will be two weeks next Thursday .  There must be some mistake , said the visitor .  I saw Mr . Carter on Broadway , near Twentieth Street , day before yesterday .  Quite a mistake , I assure you , Mrs . Vangriff , said Mrs . Pitkin , smiling . It was some other person . You were deceived by a fancied resemblance .  It is you who are wrong , Mrs . Pitkin , said Mrs . Vangriff , positively . I am somewhat acquainted with Mr . Carter , and I stopped to speak with him .  Are you sure of this ? asked Mrs . Pitkin , looking startled .  Certainly , I am sure of it .  Did you call him by name ?  Certainly; and even inquired after you . He answered that he believed you were well . I thought he was living with you ?  So he was , answered Mrs . Pitkin coolly as possible , considering the startling nature of the information she had received . Probably Uncle Oliver returned sooner than he anticipated , and was merely passing through the city . He has important business interests at the West .  I dont think he was merely passing through the city , for a friend of mine saw him at the Fifth Avenue Theater last evening .  Mrs . Pitkin actually turned as pale as her sallow complexion would admit .  I am rather surprised to hear this , I admit , she said . Was he alone , do you know ?  No; he had a lady and a boy with him .  Is it possible that Uncle Oliver has been married to some designing widow ? Mrs . Pitkin asked herself . It is positively terrible!  She did not dare to betray her agitation before Mrs . Vangriff , and sat on thorns till that lady saw fit to take leave . Then she turned to Alonzo and said , in a hollow voice:  Lonny , you heard what that woman said ?  You bet!  Do you think Uncle Oliver has gone and got married again ? she asked , in a hollow voice .  I shouldnt wonder a mite , ma , was the not consolitary reply .  If so , what will become of us ? My poor boy , I looked upon you and myself as likely to receive all of Uncle Olivers handsome property . As it is---- and she almost broke down .  Perhaps hes only engaged ? suggested Alonzo .  To be sure! said his mother , brightening up .  If so , the affair may yet be broken off . Oh , Lonny , I never thought your uncle was so artful . His trip to Florida was only a trick to put us off the scent .  What are you going to do about it , ma ?  I must find out as soon as possible where Uncle Oliver is staying . Then I will see him , and try to cure him of his infatuation . He is evidently trying to keep us in the dark , or he would have come back to his rooms .  How are you going to find out , ma ?  I dont know . Thats what puzzles me .  Spose you hire a detective ?  I wouldnt dare to . Your uncle would be angry when he found it out .  Do you spose Phil knows anything about it ? suggested Alonzo .  I dont know; it is hardly probable . Do you know where he lives ?  With the woman who called here and said she was your cousin .  Yes , I remember , Lonny . I will order the carriage , and we will go there . But you must be very careful not to let them know Uncle Oliver is in New York . I dont wish them to meet him .  All right! I aint a fool . You can trust me , ma .  Soon the Pitkin carriage was as the door , and Mrs . Pitkin and Alonzo entered it , and were driven to the shabby house so recently occupied by Mrs . Forbush .  Its a low place! said Alonzo contemptuously , as he regarded disdainfully the small dwelling .  Yes; but I suppose it is as good as she can afford to live in . Lonny , will you get out and ring the bell ? Ask if Mrs . Forbush lives there .  Alonzo did as requested .  The door was opened by a small girl , whose shabby dress was in harmony with the place .  Rebeccas child , I suppose! said Mrs . Pitkin , who was looking out of the carriage window .  Does Mrs . Forbush live here ? asked Alonzo .  No , she doesnt . Mrs . Kavanagh lives here .  Didnt Mrs . Forbush used to live here ? further asked Alonzo , at the suggestion of his mother .  I believe she did . She moved out a week ago .  Do you know where she moved to ?  No , I dont .  Does a boy named Philip Brent live here ?  No , he doesnt .  Do you know why Mrs . Forbush moved away ? asked Alonzo again , at the suggestion of his mother .  Guess she couldnt pay her rent .  Very likely , said Alonzo , who at last had received an answer with which he was pleased .  Well , ma , there isnt any more to find out here , he said .  Tell the driver--home! said his mother .  When they reached the house in Twelfth Street , there was a surprise in store for them .  Who do you thinks up-stairs , mum ? said Hannah , looking important .  Who ? Tell me quick!  Its your Uncle Oliver , mum , just got home from Florida; but I guess hes going somewhere else mum , for hes packing up his things .  Alonzo , we will go up and see him , said Mrs . Pitkin , excited . I must know what all this means .     CHAPTER XXVIII .  AN UNSATISFACTORY CONFERENCE .  Mr . Carter was taking articles from a bureau and packing them away in an open trunk , when Mrs . Pitkin entered with Alonzo . It is needless to say that his niece regarded his employment with dismay , for it showed clearly that he proposed to leave the shelter of her roof .  Uncle Oliver! she exclaimed , sinking into a chair and gazing at the old gentleman spell-bound .  Mr . Carter , whose back had been turned , turned about and faced his niece .  Oh , it is you , Lavinia! he said quietly .  What are you doing ? asked his niece .  As you see , I am packing my trunk .  Do you intend to leave us ? faltered Mrs . Pitkin .  I think it will be well for me to make a change , said Mr . Carter .  This is , indeed , a sad surprise , said Mrs Pitkin mournfully . When did you return from Florida ?  I have never been there . I changed my mind when I reached Charleston .  How long have you been in the city ?  About a week .  And never came near us . This is , indeed , unkind . In what way have we offended you ? and Mrs . Pitkin put her handkerchief to her eyes .  There were no tears in them , but she was making an attempt to touch the heart of her uncle .  Are you aware that Rebecca Forbush is in the city ? asked the old gentleman abruptly .  Ye-es , answered Mrs . Pitkin , startled .  Have you seen her ?  Ye-es . She came here one day .  And how did you treat her ? asked Mr . Carter , severely . Did you not turn the poor woman from the house , having no regard for her evident poverty ? Did you not tell her that I was very angry with her , and would not hear her name mentioned ?  Ye-es , I may have said so . You know , Uncle Oliver , you have held no communication with her for many years .  That is true--more shame to me!  And I thought I was carrying out your wishes in discouraging her visits .  You also thought that she might be a dangerous rival in my favor , and might deprive you and Alonzo of an expected share in my estate .  Oh , Uncle Oliver! how can you think so poorly of me ?  Mr . Carter eyed his niece with a half-smile .  So I do you injustice , do I , Lavinia ? he returned .  Yes , great injustice .  I am glad to hear it . I feel less objection now to telling you what are my future plans .  What are they ? asked Mrs . Pitkin apprehensively .  I have lived for ten years under your roof , and have had no communication , as you say , with Rebecca . I think it is only fair now that I should show her some attention . I have accordingly installed her as mistress of my house in Madison Avenue , and shall henceforth make my home with her .  Mrs . Pitkin felt as if the earth was sinking under her feet . The hopes and schemes of so many years had come to naught , and her hated and dreaded cousin was to be constantly in the society of the rich uncle .  Rebecca has played her cards well , she said bitterly .  She has not played them at all . She did not seek me . I sought her .  How did you know she was in the city ?  I learned it from--Philip!  There was fresh dismay .  So that boy has wormed his way into your confidence! said Mrs . Pitkin bitterly . After acting so badly that Mr . Pitkin was obliged to discharge him , he ran to you to do us a mischief .  Why was he discharged ? demanded Mr . Carter sternly . Why did your husband seize the opportunity to get rid of a boy in whom he knew me to be interested as soon as he thought I was out of the way ? Why , moreover , did he refuse the boy a reference , without which Philip could scarcely hope to get employment ?  You will have to ask Mr . Pitkin . I am sure he had good reason for the course he took . Hes an impudent , low upstart in my opinion .  So he is , ma! chimed in Alonzo , with heartiness .  Ah! I have something to say to you , Alonzo , said Mr . Carter , turning his keen glances upon the boy . What became of that letter I gave to you to post just before I went away ?  I put it in the letter-box , said Alonzo nervously .  Do you know what was in it ?  No , answered Alonzo , but he looked frightened .  There were ten dollars in it . That letter never reached Phil , to whom it was addressed .  I--dont know anything about it , faltered Alonzo .  There are ways of finding out whether letters have been posted , said Mr . Carter . I might put a detective on the case .  Alonzo turned pale , and looked much discomposed .  Of what are you accusing my boy ? asked Mrs . Pitkin , ready to contend for her favorite . So that boy has been telling lies about him , has he ? and you believe scandalous stories about your own flesh and blood ?  Not exactly that , Lavinia .  Well , your near relation , and that on the testimony of a boy you know nothing about . When Lonny is so devoted to you , too!  I never noticed any special devotion , said Mr . Carter , amused . You are mistaken , however , about Philip trying to injure him . I simply asked Philip whether he had received such a letter , and he said no .  I dare say he did receive it , said Mrs . Pitkin spitefully .  We wont argue the matter now , said the old gentleman . I will only say that you and Alonzo , and Mr . Pitkin also , have gone the wrong way to work to secure my favor . You have done what you could to injure two persons , one your own cousin , because you were jealous .  You judge me very hardly , uncle , said Mrs . Pitkin , seeing that she must adopt a different course . I have no bad feeling against Rebecca , and as to the boy , I will ask my husband to take him back into the store . I am sure he will do it , because you wish it .  I dont wish it , answered Mr . Carter , rather unexpectedly .  Oh , well , answered Mrs . Pitkin , looking relieved , that is as you say .  I have other views for Philip , said Mr . Carter . He is with me as my private secretary .  Is he living with you ? asked his niece , in alarm .  Yes .  There was no need of taking a stranger , Uncle Oliver . We should be glad to have Alonzo act as your secretary , though of course we should want him to stay at home .  I shall not deprive you of Alonzo , said Mr . Carter , with a tinge of sarcasm in his tone . Philip will suit me better .  Mr . Carter turned and resumed his packing .  Are you quite determined to leave us ? asked Mrs . Pitkin , in a subdued tone .  Yes; it will be better .  But you will come back--say after a few weeks ?  No , I think not , he answered dryly .  And shall we not see you at all ?  Oh , I shall call from time to time , and besides , you will know where I am , and can call whenever you desire .  People will talk about your leaving us , complained Mrs . Pitkin .  Let them talk . I never agreed to have my movements controlled by peoples gossip . And now , Lavinia , I shall have to neglect you and resume my packing . To-morrow I shall bring Philip here to help me .  Would you like to have Alonzo help you , Uncle Oliver ?  This offer , much to Alonzos relief , was declined . He feared that he should be examined more closely by the old gentleman about the missing money , which at that very moment he had in his pocket .  Mrs . Pitkin went down stairs feeling angry and baffled . All that she had done to retain her ascendency over Uncle Oliver had failed , and Mrs . Forbush and Philip seemed to have superseded herself and Alonzo in his regard . She conferred with Mr . Pitkin on his return from the store , but the more they considered the matter the worse it looked for their prospects .  Could anything be done ?    CHAPTER XXIX .  A TRUCE .  No more distasteful news could have come to the Pitkins than to learn that Philip and their poor cousin had secured a firm place in the good graces of Uncle Oliver . Yet they did not dare to show their resentment . They had found that Uncle Oliver had a will of his own , and meant to exercise it . Had they been more forbearing he would still be an inmate of their house instead of going over to the camp of their enemies , for so they regarded Mrs . Forbush and Phil .  I hate that woman , Mr . Pitkin! said his wife fiercely . I scorn such underhanded work . How she has sneaked into the good graces of poor , deluded Uncle Oliver!  You have played your cards wrong , Lavinia , said her husband peevishly .  I ? That is a strange accusation , Mr . Pitkin . It was you , to my thinking . You sent off that errand boy , and that is how the whole thing came about . If he had been in your store he wouldnt have met Uncle Oliver down at the pier .  You and Alonzo persuaded me to discharge him .  Oh , of course its Alonzo and me! When you see Rebecca Forbush and that errand boy making ducks and drakes out of Uncle Olivers money you may wish you had acted more wisely .  Really , Lavinia , you are a most unreasonable woman . Its no use criminating and recriminating . We must do what we can to mend matters .  What can we do ?  They havent got the money yet--remember that! We must try to re-establish friendly relations with Mr . Carter .  Perhaps youll tell me how ?  Certainly! Call as soon as possible at the house on Madison Avenue .  Call on that woman ?  Yes; and try to smooth matters over as well as you can . Take Alonzo with you , and instruct him to be polite to Philip .  I dont believe Lonny will be willing to demean himself so far .  Hell have to , answered Mr . Pitkin firmly .  Weve all made a mistake , and the sooner we remedy it the better .  Mrs . Pitkin thought it over . The advice was unpalatable , but it was evidently sound . Uncle Oliver was rich , and they must not let his money slip through their fingers . So , after duly instructing Alonzo in his part , Mrs . Pitkin , a day or two later , ordered her carriage and drove in state to the house of her once poor relative .  Is Mrs . Forbush at home ? she asked of the servant .  I believe so , madam , answered a dignified man-servant .  Take this card to her .  Mrs . Pitkin and Alonzo were ushered into a drawing-room more elegant than their own . She sat on a sofa with Alonzo .  Who would think that Rebecca Forbush would come to live like this ? she said , half to herself .  And that boy , supplemented Alonzo .  To be sure! Your uncle is fairly infatuated .  Just then Mrs . Forbush entered , followed by her daughter . She was no longer clad in a shabby dress , but wore an elegant toilet , handsome beyond her own wishes , but insisted upon by Uncle Oliver .  I am glad to see you , Lavinia , she said simply . This is my daughter .  Julia , too , was stylishly dressed , and Alonzo , in spite of his prejudices , could not help regarding this handsome cousin with favor .  I do not propose to detail the interview . Mrs . Pitkin was on her good behavior , and appeared very gracious .  Mrs . Forbush could not help recalling the difference between her demeanor now and on the recent occasion , when in her shabby dress she called at the house in Twelfth Street , but she was too generous to recall it .  As they were about to leave , Mr . Carter and Philip entered the room , sent for by Mrs . Forbush .  How do you do , Philip ? said Mrs . Pitkin , graciously . Alonzo , this is Philip .  How do ? growled Alonzo , staring enviously at Phils handsome new suit , which was considerably handsomer than his own .  Very well , Alonzo .  You must come and see Lonny , said Mrs . Pitkin pleasantly .  Thank you! answered Phil politely .  He did not say it was a pleasure , for he was a boy of truth , and he did not feel that it would be .  Uncle Oliver was partially deceived by his nieces new manner . He was glad that there seemed to be a reconciliation , and he grew more cordial than he had been since his return .  After awhile Mrs . Pitkin rose to go .  When she was fairly in the carriage once more , she said passionately:  How I hate them!  You were awful sweet on them , ma! said Alonzo , opening his eyes .  I had to be . But the time will come when I will open the eyes of Uncle Oliver to the designs of that scheming woman and that artful errand boy .  It was Mrs . Pitkins true self that spoke .    CHAPTER XXX .  PHILS TRUST .  Among the duties which devolved upon Phil was Mr . Carters bank business . He generally made deposits for Uncle Oliver , and drew money on his personal checks whenever he needed it .  It has already been said that Mr . Carter was a silent partner in the firm of which Mr . Pitkin was the active manager . The arrangement between the partners was , that each should draw out two hundred dollars a week toward current expenses , and that the surplus , if any , at the end of the year , should be divided according to the terms of the partnership .  When Phil first presented himself with a note from Mr . Carter , he was an object of attention to the clerks , who knew that he had been discharged by Mr . Pitkin . Yet here he was , dressed in a new suit provided with a watch , and wearing every mark of prosperity . One of the most surprised was Mr . G . Washington Wilbur , with whom , as an old friend , Phil stopped to chat .  Is old Pitkin going to take you back ? he inquired .  No , answered Phil promptly . He couldnt have me if he wanted me .  Have you got another place ?  Yes .  Whats the firm ?  It isnt in business . I am private secretary to Mr . Carter .  Mr . Wilbur regarded him with surprise and respect .  Is it a soft place ? he inquired .  Its a very pleasant place .  What wages do you get ?  Twelve dollars a week and board .  You dont mean it ?  Yes , I do .  Say , doesnt he want another secretary ? asked Mr . Wilbur .  No , I think not .  Id like a place of that sort . Youre a lucky fellow , Phil .  I begin to think I am .  Of course you dont live at the old place .  No; I live on Madison Avenue . By the way , Wilbur , how is your lady-love ?  Mr . Wilbur looked radiant .  I think Im getting on , he said . I met her the other evening , and she smiled .  That is encouraging , said Phil , as soberly as possible . All things come to him who waits! Thats what I had to write in my copy-book once .  Phil was received by Mr . Pitkin with more graciousness than he expected . He felt that he must do what he could to placate Uncle Oliver , but he was more dangerous when friendly in his manner than when he was rude and impolite . He was even now plotting to get Phil into a scrape which should lose him the confidence of Uncle Oliver .  Generally Phil was paid in a check payable to the order of Mr . Carter . But one Saturday two hundred dollars in bills were placed in his hands instead .  You see how much confidence I place in your honesty , said Mr . Pitkin . You couldnt use the check . This money you could make off with .  It would be very foolish , to say the least , responded Phil .  Of course , of course . I know you are trustworthy , or I would have given you a check instead .  When Phil left the building he was followed , though he did not know it , by a man looking like a clerk .  Ah , Phil , you are in danger , though you dont suspect it .    CHAPTER XXXI .  PHIL IS SHADOWED .  Phil felt that he must be more than usually careful , because the money he had received was in the form of bills , which , unlike the check , would be of use to any thief appropriating it . That he was in any unusual danger , however , he was far from suspecting .  He reached Broadway , and instead of taking an omnibus , started to walk up-town . He knew there was no haste , and a walk up the great busy thoroughfare had its attractions for him , as it has for many others .  Behind him , preserving a distance of from fifteen to twenty feet , walked a dark-complexioned man of not far from forty years of age . Of course Phil was not likely to notice him .  Whatever the mans designs might be , he satisfied himself at first with simply keeping our hero in view . But as they both reached Bleecker Street , he suddenly increased his pace and caught up with Phil . He touched the boy on the shoulder , breathing quickly , as if he had been running .  Phil turned quickly .  Do you want me , sir ? he asked , eying the stranger in surprise .  I dont know . Perhaps I am mistaken . Are you in the employ of Mr . Oliver Carter ?  Yes , sir .  Ah I then you are the boy I want . I have bad news for you .  Bad news! repeated Phil , alarmed . What is it ?  Mr . Carter was seized with a fit in the street half an hour since .  Is he--dead ? asked Phil , in dismay .  No , no! I think he will come out all right .  Where is he ?  In my house . I didnt of course know who he was , but I found in his pocket a letter directed to Oliver Carter , Madison Avenue . There was also a business card . He is connected in business with Mr . Pitkin , is he not ?  Yes , sir , answered Phil; where is your house ?  In Bleecker Street , near by . Mr . Carter is lying on the bed . He is unconscious , but my wife heard him say: Call Philip . I suppose that is you ?  Yes , sir; my name is Philip .  I went around to his place of business , and was told that you had just left there . I was given a description of you and hurried to find you . Will you come to the house and see Mr . Carter ?  Yes , sir , answered Phil , forgetting everything except that his kind and generous employer was sick , perhaps dangerously .  Thank you; I shall feel relieved . Of course you can communicate with his friends and arrange to have him carried home .  Yes , sir; I live at his house .  That is well .  They had turned down Bleecker Street , when it occurred to Phil to say:  I dont understand how Mr . Carter should be in this neighborhood .  That is something I cant explain , as I know nothing about his affairs , said the stranger pleasantly . Perhaps he may have property on the street .  I dont think so . I attend to much of his business , and he would have sent me if there had been anything of that kind to attend to .  I dare say you are right , said his companion .  Of course I know nothing about it . I only formed a conjecture .  Has a physician been sent for ? asked Phil .  Do you know of any we can call in ?  My wife agreed to send for one on Sixth Avenue , said the stranger . I didnt wait for him to come , but set out for the store .  Nothing could be more ready or plausible than the answers of his new acquaintance , and Phil was by no means of a suspicious temperament . Had he lived longer in the city it might have occurred to him that there was something rather unusual in the circumstances , but he knew that Mr . Carter had spoken of leaving the house at the breakfast-table , indeed had left it before he himself had set out for the store . For the time being the thought of the sum of money which he carried with him had escaped his memory , but it was destined very soon to be recalled to his mind .  They had nearly reached Sixth Avenue , when his guide stopped in front of a shabby brick house .  This is where I live , he said . We will go in .  He produced a key , opened the door , and Phil accompanied him up a shabby staircase to the third floor . He opened the door of a rear room , and made a sign to Phil to enter .    CHAPTER XXXII .  PHIL IS ROBBED .  When he was fairly in the room Phil looked about him expecting to see Mr . Carter , but the room appeared unoccupied . He turned to his companion , a look of surprise on his face , but he was destined to be still more surprised , and that not in a pleasant way . His guide had locked the door from the inside and put the key in his pocket .  What does that mean ? asked Phil , with sudden apprehension .  What do you refer to ? asked his guide with an unpleasant smile .  Why do you lock the door ?  I thought it might be safest , was the significant answer .  I dont believe Mr . Carter is in the house at all , said Phil quickly .  I dont believe he is either , youngster .  Why did you tell me he was here ? demanded Phil , with rising indignation .  I thought you wouldnt come if I didnt , replied his companion nonchalantly .  Answer me one thing , is Mr . Carter sick at all ?   Not that I know of .  Then I am trapped!  Precisely . You may as well know the truth now .  Phil had already conjectured the reason why he had been enticed to this poor dwelling . The two hundred dollars which he had in his pocket made him feel very uncomfortable . I think I may say truly that if the money had been his own he would have been less disturbed . But he thought , with a sinking heart , that if the money should be taken from him , he would himself fall under suspicion , and he could not bear to have Mr . Carter think that he had repaid his kindness with such black ingratitude . He might be mistaken . The man before him might not know he had such a sum of money in his possession , and of course he was not going to give him the information .  I am glad Mr . Carter is all right , said Phil . Now tell me why you have taken such pains to get me here ?  Why , as to that , said his companion , there were at least two hundred good reasons .  Phil turned pale , for he understood now that in some way his secret was known .  What do you mean ? he asked , not wholly able to conceal his perturbed feelings .  You know well enough , boy , said the other significantly . Youve got two hundred dollars in your pocket . I want it .  Are you a thief , then ? said Phil , with perhaps imprudent boldness .  Just take care what you say . I wont be insulted by such a whipper-snapper as you . Youd better not call names . Hand over that money!  How do you know I have any money ? Phil asked , trying to gain a little time for deliberation .  No matter . Hand it over , I say!  Dont take it! said Phil , agitated . It isnt mine!  Then you neednt mind giving it up .  It belongs to Mr . Carter .  He has plenty more .  But he will think I took it . He will think I am dishonest .  That is nothing to me .  Let me go , pleaded Phil , and I will never breathe a word about your wanting to rob me . You know you might get into trouble for it .  Thats all bosh! The money , I say! said the man sternly .  I wont give it to you! said Phil boldly .  You wont , hey ? Then I shall have to take it . If I hurt you , you will have yourself to blame .  So saying the man seized Phil , and then a struggle ensued , the boy defending himself as well as he could . He made a stouter resistance than the thief anticipated , and the latter became irritated with the amount of trouble he had to take it . I should be glad to report that Phil made a successful defense , but this was hardly to be expected . He was a strong boy , but he had to cope with a strong man , and though right was on his side , virtue in his case had to succumb to triumphant vice .  Phil was thrown down , and when prostrate , with the mans knee on his breast , the latter succeeded in stripping him of the money he had so bravely defended .  There , you young rascal! he said , as he rose to his feet; you see how much good you have done . You might as well have given up the money in the first place .  It was my duty to keep it from you , if I could , said Phil , panting with his exertions .  Well , if thats any satisfaction to you , youre welcome to it .  He went to the door and unlocked it .  May I go now ? asked Phil .  Not much . Stay where you are!  A moment later and Phil found himself alone and a prisoner .   CHAPTER XXXIII .  A TERRIBLE SITUATION .  Phil tried the door , but now it was locked on the outside , and he found that he was securely trapped . He went to the window , but here , too , there was no chance of escape . Even if he had been able to get safely out , he would have landed in a back-yard from which there was no egress except through the house , which was occupied by his enemies .  What shall I do ? Phil asked himself , despairingly . Mr . Carter will be anxious about me , and perhaps he may think I have gone off with the money!  This to Phil was the worst of his troubles . He prized a good reputation and the possession of an honorable name , and to be thought a thief would distress him exceedingly .  What a fool I was to walk into such a trap! he said to himself . I might have known Mr . Carter would not be in such a neighborhood .  Phil was too severe upon himself . I suspect that most of my boy readers , even those who account themselves sharp , might have been deceived as easily . The fact is , rogues are usually plausible , and they are so trained in deception that it is no reflection upon their victims that they allow themselves to be taken in .  Hours passed , and still Phil found himself a prisoner . Each moment he became more anxious and troubled .  How long will they keep me ? he asked himself . They cant keep me here forever .  About six oclock the door was opened slightly , and a plate of bread and butter was thrust in , together with a glass of cold water . Who brought it up Phil did not know , for the person did not show himself or herself .  Phil ate and drank what was provided , not that he was particularly hungry , but he felt that he must keep up his strength .  They dont mean to starve me , at any rate , he reflected . That is some consolation . While there is life , there is hope .  A little over an hour passed . It became dark in Phils prison , but he had no means of lighting the gas . There was a small bed in the room , and he made up his mind that he must sleep there .  All at once there was a confused noise and disturbance . He could not make out what it meant , till above all other sounds he heard the terrible cry of Fire!  Fire! Where is it ? thought Phil .  It was not long before he made a terrible discovery . It was the very house in which he was confined! There was a trampling of feet and a chorus of screams . The smoke penetrated into the room .  Heavens! Am I to be burned alive! thought our poor hero .  He jumped up and down on the floor , pounded frantically on the door , and at last the door was broken open by a stalwart fireman , and Phil made his way out , half-suffocated .  Once in the street , he made his way as fast as possible homeward .    CHAPTER XXXIV .  PHILS FRIENDS AND HIS ENEMIES .  Meanwhile , Phils long absence had excited anxiety and alarm .  What can have become of Philip ? said Mr . Carter when supper time came and he did not arrive .  I cant think , answered Mrs . Forbush . He is generally very prompt .  That is what makes me feel anxious . I am afraid something must have happened to him .  Did you send him anywhere , Uncle Oliver ?  Yes; he called , as usual , to get my check from Mr . Pitkin .  And he ought to have been here earlier ?  Certainly . He wouldnt have to wait for that .  Philip is very careful . I cant think that he has met with an accident .  Even the most prudent and careful get into trouble sometimes .  They were finally obliged to sit down to supper alone . None of the three enjoyed it . Not only Mr . Carter and Mrs . Forbush , but Julia was anxious and troubled .  I didnt know I cared so much for the boy , said Uncle Oliver . He has endeared himself to me . I care nothing for the loss of the money if he will only return safe .  It was about a quarter of eight when the door-bell rang , and the servant ushered in Mr . and Mrs . Pitkin and Alonzo .  After the usual greetings were interchanged , Mrs . Pitkin said , looking about her:  Where is Philip ?  We are very much concerned about him , said Mr . Carter , his face showing his trouble . He has not been home since morning . Did he call at your store , Pitkin ?  Hasnt he been home since ? asked Pitkin , in a tone unpleasantly significant .  No . At what time did he leave the store ?  Hours since . I--I am not sure but I may be able to throw some light on his failure to return .  Do so , if you can! said Uncle Oliver .  In place of giving him a check , I gave the boy two hundred dollars in bills .  Well ?  Dont you see ? The temptation has proved too strong for him . I think , Uncle Oliver , you wont see him back in a hurry .  Do you mean to say the boy would steal ? demanded the old gentleman indignantly .  I think it more than likely that he has appropriated the money .  I am sure he has not , said Mrs . Forbush .  And so am I , chimed in Julia .  Mr . Pitkin shrugged his shoulders .  So you think , he answered; but I dont agree with you .  Nor I! said Mrs . Pitkin , nodding her head vigorously . I never had any confidence in the boy . I dont mind telling you now that I have warned Alonzo not to get too intimate with him . You remember it , Lonny ?  Yesm , responded Lonny .  Then you think the boy capable of appropriating the money ? asked Mr . Carter quietly .  Yes , I do .  Well , I dont! said Uncle Oliver emphatically .  You are very easily deceived , said Mrs . Pitkin .  Dont be too sure of that , returned Mr . Carter , with a significant glance , that made his niece feel uncomfortable .  I suspect you will have to admit it , said Mr . Pitkin . If , contrary to my anticipation , the boy returns , and brings the money with him , I will own myself mistaken .  Just then the front door was heard to open; there was a sound of steps in the hall , and Phil came hurriedly into the room .  Mr . and Mrs . Pitkin exchanged looks of surprise and dismay; but Mrs . Forbush , her daughter and Uncle Oliver looked delighted .    CHAPTER XXXV .  THE PITKINS RETIRE IN DISGUST .  Where have you been , Philip ? asked Mr . Carter , breaking the silence . We were getting anxious about you .  I have bad news for you , sir , returned Phil , saying what stood first in his mind . I have lost the two hundred dollars Mr . Pitkin paid me this morning .  So you lost it ? observed Mr . Pitkin with a sneer , emphasizing the word lost to show his incredulity .  Yes , sir , I lost it , answered Phil , looking him fearlessly in the eye; or , rather , it was stolen from me .  Oh! now it is stolen , is it ? repeated Pitkin .  Really , Uncle Oliver , this is getting interesting .  I believe I am the proper person to question Philip , said Mr . Carter coldly . It was my money , I take it .  Yes , it was yours . As I made the payment , I cannot , of course , be responsible for its not reaching you . You will pardon my saying that it would have been wiser to employ a different messenger .  Why ? demanded Uncle Oliver , looking displeased .  Why , really , Uncle Oliver , said Mr . Pitkin , I should think the result might convince you of that .  We had better let Philip tell his story , said Mr . Carter quietly . How did it happen , Philip ?  Thereupon Philip told the story already familiar to the reader .  Upon my word , quite a romantic story! commented Mr . Pitkin , unable to repress a sneer . So you were tracked by a rascal , lured into a den of thieves , robbed of your money , or , rather , Mr . Carters , and only released by the house catching fire ?  That is exactly what happened to me , sir , said Philip , coloring with indignation , for he saw that Mr . Pitkin was doing his best to discredit him .  It quite does credit to your imagination . By the way , boy , have you been in the habit of reading dime novels ?  I never read one in my life , sir .  Then I think you would succeed in writing them . For a boy of sixteen , you certainly have a vivid imagination .  I quite agree with my husband , said Mrs . Pitkin . The boys story is ridiculously improbable . I cant understand how he has the face to stand there and expect Uncle Oliver to swallow such rubbish .  I dont expect you to believe it , either of you , said Philip manfully , for you have never treated me fairly .  I think you will find , also , that my uncle is too sensible a man to credit it , also , retorted Mrs Pitkin .  Speak for yourself , Lavinia , said Mr . Carter , who had waited intentionally to let his relatives express themselves . I believe every word of Philips story .  You do ? ejaculated Mrs . Pitkin , rolling her eyes and nodding her head , in the vain endeavor to express her feelings . Really , Uncle Oliver , for a man of your age and good sense----  Thank you for that admission , Lavinia , said Mr . Carter mockingly . Go on .  I was about to say that you seem infatuated with this boy , of whom we know nothing , except from his own account . To my mind his story is a most ridiculous invention .  Mr . Pitkin , did any one enter your store just after Philip left it to inquire after him ?  No , sir , answered Pitkin triumphantly . Thats a lie , at any rate .  You will remember that Philip did not make the assertion himself . This was the statement of the thief who robbed him .  Yes , of course , sneered Pitkin . He told his story very shrewdly .  Mr . Carter , said Philip , I can show you or any one else the house in which I was confined in Bleecker Street , and there will be no trouble in obtaining proof of the fire .  I dare say there may have been such a fire , said Mr . Pitkin , and you may have happened to see it , and decided to weave it into your story .  Do you think I stole the money or used it for my own purpose ? asked Philip pointedly .  Mr . Pitkin shrugged his shoulders .  Young man , he said , upon this point I can only say that your story is grossly improbable . It wont hold water .  Permit me to judge of that , Mr . Pitkin , said Mr . Carter . I wish to ask YOU one question .  To ask ME a question! said Pitkin , surprised .  Yes; why did you pay Philip in bills to-day ? Why didnt you give him a check , as usual ?  Why , answered Pitkin , hesitating , I thought it wouldnt make any difference to you . I thought you would be able to use it more readily .  Did you suppose I would specially need to use money instead of a check this week ? Why break over your usual custom ?  Really , I didnt give much thought to the matter , answered Pitkin , hesitating . I acted on a sudden impulse .  Your impulse has cost me two hundred dollars . Do me the favor , when Philip calls next week , to hand him a check .  You mean to retain him in your employ after this ? asked Mrs . Pitkin sharply .  Yes , I do . Why shouldnt I ?  You are very trustful , observed the lady , tossing her head . If this had happened to Lonny here , we should never have heard the last of it .  Perhaps not! responded the old gentleman dryly . When a young gentleman is trusted with a letter to mail containing money , and that letter never reaches its destination , it may at least be inferred that he is careless .  It will be remembered that this was the first knowledge Mrs . Pitkin or her husband had of the transaction referred to .  What do you mean , Uncle Oliver ? demanded Mr . Pitkin .  Mr . Carter explained .  This is too much! said Mrs . Pitkin angrily .  You mean to accuse my poor boy of opening the letter and stealing the money ?  If I was as ready to bring accusations as you , Lavinia , I should undoubtedly say that it looked a little suspicious , but I prefer to let the matter rest .  I think , Mr . Pitkin , we had better go , said Mrs . Pitkin , rising with dignity . Since Uncle Oliver chooses to charge his own nephew with being a thief----  I beg pardon , Lavinia , I have not done so .  You might just as well , said Lavinia Pitkin , tossing her head . Come , Mr . Pitkin; come , my poor Lonny , we will go home . This is no place for you .  Good-evening , Lavinia , said Mr . Carter calmly . I shall be glad to see you whenever you feel like calling .  When you have discharged that boy , I may call again , said Mrs . Pitkin spitefully .  You will have to wait some time , then . I am quite capable of managing my own affairs .  When Mr . Pitkin had left the house , by no means in a good humor , Phil turned to his employer and said gratefully:  I dont know how to thank you , Mr . Carter , for your kind confidence in me . I admit that the story I told you is a strange one , and I could not have blamed you for doubting me .  But I dont doubt you , my dear Philip , said Mr . Carter kindly .  Nor I , said Mrs . Forbush . I feel provoked with Lavinia and her husband for trying to throw discredit upon your statement .  In fact , said Mr . Carter humorously , the only one of us that suspected you was Julia .  Oh , Uncle Oliver! exclaimed Julia , in dismay . I never dreamed of doubting Phil .  Then , said Mr . Carter , it appears that you have three friends , at least .  If , said Phil ? you would allow me to make up part of the loss , by surrendering a part of my salary----  Couldnt be thought of , Philip! said Uncle Oliver resolutely . I dont care for the money , but I should like to know how the thief happened to know that to-day you received money instead of a check .  Without saying a word to Phil , Uncle Oliver called the next day on a noted detective and set him to work ferreting out the secret .    CHAPTER XXXVI .  THE FALSE HEIR .  In the suburbs of Chicago , perhaps a dozen miles from the great city , stands a fine country house , in the midst of a fine natural park . From the cupola which surmounts the roof can be seen in the distance the waters of Lake Michigan , stretching for many miles from north to south and from east to west , like a vast inland sea .  The level lawns , the greenhouses , the garden with rare plants and flowers , show clearly that this is the abode of a rich man . My readers will be specially interested to know that this is the luxurious and stately home of Mr . Granville , whose sons fortunes we have been following .  This , too , is the home of Mrs . Brent and Jonas , who , under false representations , have gained a foothold in the home of the Western millionaire .  Surely it is a great change for one brought up like Jonas to be the recognized heir and supposed son of so rich a man! It is a change , too , for his mother , who , though she dare not avow the relationship , is permitted to share the luxury of her son . Mrs . Brent has for her own use two of the best rooms in the mansion , and so far as money can bring happiness , she has every right to consider herself happy .  Is she ?  Not as happy as she anticipated . To begin with , she is always dreading that some untoward circumstance will reveal the imposition she has practiced upon Mr . Granville . In that case what can she expect but to be ejected in disgrace from her luxurious home ? To be sure , she will have her husbands property left , but it would be a sad downfall and descent in the social scale .  Besides , she finds cause for anxiety in Jonas , and the change which his sudden and undeserved elevation has wrought in him . It requires a strong mind to withstand the allurements and temptations of prosperity , and Jonas is far from possessing a strong mind . He is , indeed , if I may be allowed the expression , a vulgar little snob , utterly selfish , and intent solely upon his own gratification . He has a love for drink , and against the protests of his mother and the positive command of Mr . Granville , indulges his taste whenever he thinks he can do so without fear of detection . To the servants he makes himself very offensive by assuming consequential airs and a lordly bearing , which excites their hearty dislike .  He is making his way across the lawn at this moment . He is dressed in clothes of the finest material and the most fashionable cut . A thick gold chain is displayed across his waistcoat , attached to an expensive gold watch , bought for him by his supposed father . He carries in his hand a natty cane , and struts along with head aloft and nose in the air .  Two under-gardeners are at work upon a flowerbed as he passes .  What time is it , Master Philip ? says one , a boy about a year older than Jonas .  My good boy , said Jonas haughtily , I dont carry a watch for your benefit .  The gardener bit his lip , and surveyed the heir with unequivocal disgust .  Very well , he retorted; Ill wait till a gentleman comes this way .  A flush of anger was visible on the cheek of Jonas despite his freckles .  Do you mean to say Im not a gentleman! he demanded angrily .  You dont act like one , returned Dan .  Youd better not be impertinent to me! exclaimed Jonas , his small gray eyes flashing with indignation . Take that back!  I wont , for its true! said Dan undauntedly .  Take that , then!  Jonas raised his cane and brought it down smartly on the young gardeners shoulder .  He soon learned that he had acted imprudently . Dan dropped his rake , sprang forward , and seizing the cane , wrenched it from the hands of the young heir , after which he proceeded to break it across his knee .  Theres your cane! he said contemptuously , as he threw the pieces on the ground .  What did you do that for ? demanded Jonas , outraged .  Because you insulted me . Thats why .  How can I insult you ? Youre only a poor working boy!  I wouldnt change places with you , said Dan . Id like well enough to be rich , but I wouldnt be willing to be as mean as you are .  Youll suffer for this! said Jonas , his little bead-like eyes glowing with anger . Ill have you turned off this very day , or as soon as my father gets home .  If he says Im to go , Ill go! said Dan . Hes a gentleman .  Jonas made his way to his mothers room . She noticed his perturbed look .  Whats the matter , my dear boy ? she asked . Whats the matter , Jonas ?  I wish youd stop calling me your dear boy , said Jonas angrily .  I--I forget sometimes , said Mrs . Brent , with a half-sigh .  Then you ought not to forget . Do you want to spoil everything ?  We are alone now , Jonas , and I cannot forget that I am your mother .  Youd better , if you know whats best for both of us , said Jonas .  Mrs . Brent was far from being a kind-hearted woman . Indeed she was very cold , but Jonas was her only son , and to him she was as much attached as it was possible for her to be to any one . Formerly he had returned her affection in a slight degree , but since he had figured as a rich mans son and heir he had begun , incredible as it may appear , to look down upon his own mother . She was not wholly ignorant of this change in his feelings , and it made her unhappy . He was all she had to live for . But for him she would not have stooped to take part in the conspiracy in which she was now a participant . It seemed hard that her only son , for whom she had sinned , should prove so ungrateful .  My boy , she said , I would not on any account harm you or injure your prospects , but when we are alone there can be no harm in my treating you as my son .  It cant do any good , grumbled Jonas , and we might be overheard .  I will be cautious . You may be sure of that . But why do you look so annoyed ?  Why ? Reason enough . That boy Dan , the under-gardener , has been impudent to me .  He has ? said Mrs . Brent quickly . What has he done ?  Jonas rehearsed the story . He found in his mother a sympathetic listener .  He is bold! she said , compressing her lips .  Yes , he is . When I told him I would have him turned off , he coolly turned round and said that my father was a gentleman , and wouldnt send him away . Ma , will you do me a favor ?  What is it , Jonas ?  Send him off before the governor gets home . You can make it all right with him .  Mrs . Brent hesitated .  Mr . Granville might think I was taking a liberty .  Oh , you can make it all right with him . Say that he was very impudent to me . After what has happened , if he stays hell think he can treat me just as he pleases .  Again Mrs . Brent hesitated , but her own inclination prompted her to do as her son desired .  You may tell Dan to come here . I wish to speak to him , she said .  Jonas went out and did the errand .  Mrs . Brent wants to see me ? said Dan . I have nothing to do with her .  Youd better come in if you know whats best for yourself . said Jonas , with an exultation he did not attempt to conceal .  Oh , well , I have no objection to meeting Mrs . Brent , said Dan . Ill go in .  Mrs . Brent eyed the young gardener with cold animosity .  You have been impudent to Master Philip , she said . Of course you cannot remain any longer in his fathers employment . Here are five dollars--more than is due you . Take it , and leave the estate .  I wont take your money , Mrs . Brent , said Dan independently , and I wont take my dismissal from any one but Mr . Granville himself .  Do you defy me , then ? said Mrs . Brent , with a firmer compression of her lips .  No , Mrs . Brent , I dont defy you , but you have nothing to do with me , and I shall not take any orders or any dismissal from you .  Dont be impertinent to my---- burst forth from Jonas , and then he stopped in confusion .  To your--what ? asked Dan quickly .  To my--nurse , faltered Jonas .  Dan looked suspiciously from one to the other .  Theres something between those two , he said to himself . Something we dont know of .    CHAPTER XXXVII .  MRS . BRENTS PANIC .  The chambermaid in the Granville household was a cousin of Dan , older by three years . She took a warm interest in Dans welfare , though there was nothing but cousinly affection between them .  Fresh from his interview with Mrs . Brent , Dan made his way to the kitchen .  Well , Aggie , he said , I may have to say good-by soon .  What , Dan! Youre not for lavin , are you ? asked Aggie , in surprise .  Mrs . Brent has just given me notice , answered Dan .  Mrs . Brent! What business is it of hers , and how did it happen , anyway ?  She thinks its her business , and its all on account of that stuck-up Philip .  Tell me about it , Cousin Dan .  Dan did so , and wound up by repeating his young masters unfinished sentence .  Its my belief , he said , that theres something between those two . If there wasnt , why is Mrs . Brent here ?  Why , indeed , Dan ? chimed in Aggie . Perhaps I can guess something .  What is it ?  Never you mind . Ill only say I overheard Mrs . Brent one day speaking to Master Philip , but she didnt call him Philip .  What then ?  JONAS! Im ready to take my oath she called him Jonas .  Perhaps that is his real name . He may have it for his middle name .  I dont believe it . Dan , Ive an idea . Im going to see Mrs . Brent and make her think I know something . You see ?  Do as you think best , Aggie . I told her I wouldnt take a dismissal from her .  Mrs . Brent was in her own room . She was not a woman who easily forgave , and she was provoked with Dan , who had defied her authority . She knew very well that in dismissing him she had wholly exceeded her authority , but this , as may readily be supposed , did not make her feel any more friendly to the young gardener . Jonas artfully led her indignation .  Dan doesnt have much respect for you , mother , he said . He doesnt mind you any more than he does a kitchen-girl .  He may find he has made a mistake , said Mrs . Brent , a bright red spot in each cheek , indicating her anger . He may find he has made a mistake in defying my authority .  I wouldnt stand it if I was you , ma .  I wont! said Mrs . Brent decidedly , nodding vigorously and compressing her lips more firmly .  Soon after a knock was heard at Mrs . Brents door .  Come in! she said in a sharp , incisive voice .  The door was opened and Aggie entered .  What do you want of me , Aggie ? asked Mrs . Brent , in some surprise .  I hear youve been tellin Dan hell have to go , said the chambermaid .  Yes , answered Mrs . Brent , but I fail to see what business it is of yours .  Dans me cousin , maam .  Thats nothing to me . He has been impertinent to Master Philip , and afterward to me .  I know all about it , maam . He told me .  Then you understand why he must leave . He will do well to be more respectful in his next place .  It wasnt his fault , maam , accordin to what he told me .  No doubt! sneered Mrs . Brent . It is hardly likely that he would admit himself to be in fault .  Dans a good , truthful boy , maam .  What did he tell you ?  The moment had come for Aggies master-stroke , and she fixed her eyes keenly on Mrs . Brent to watch the effect of her words .  He said he was at work in the garden , maam , when Master Jonas----  WHAT! exclaimed Mrs . Brent , staring at the girl in dismay .  He was at work in the garden , maam when Master Jonas----  What do you mean , girl ? Who is Master Jonas ? asked Mrs . Brent , trying to conceal her agitation .  Did I say Jonas , maam . La , what could I be thinking of ? Of course I mean Master Philip .  What should have put the name of Jonas into your head ? demanded Mrs . Brent nervously .  I must have heard it somewhere , said Aggie , with a quick , shrewd look out of the corner of her eyes . Well , Dan just asked the young master a civil question , and Master Philip , he snapped him up rude-like . Mrs . Brent I think youd better not make any fuss about Dan . It wasnt so much his fault as the fault of Master Jonas--oh , dear! I beg pardon , I mean Master Philip .  Dont repeat that ridiculous name again , Aggie! said Mrs . Brent . Your young master has nothing to do with it . You ought to know that his name is Philip .  I should say so! broke in Jonas . I aint goin to be called out of my name!  As to Dan , proceeded Mrs . Brent . I am willing to overlook his impertinence this time . I wont say a word to Mr . Granville , but he must be more careful hereafter .  Im sure Im obliged to you , maam , said Aggie demurely .  When she was out of the room she nodded to herself triumphantly .  Sure , Ive got the old lady under me thumb , but divil a bit I know how . Its all in the word Jonas . When I want a favor , all Ive got to do is to say that word . I wonder what it manes now , anyhow .  However , Aggie communicated to Dan the welcome intelligence that he would have no trouble with Mrs . Brent or Philip , but as to the way in which she had managed she kept that to herself .  I want to think it over , she said . Theres a secret , and its about Jonas . Ill wait patiently , and maybe Ill hear some more about it .  As for Mrs . Brent , she was panic-stricken . Uncertain how much Aggie knew , she feared that she knew all . But how could she have discovered it ? And was it come to this that she and Jonas were in the power of an Irish chambermaid ? It was galling to her pride .  She turned to her son when they were left alone .  How could she have found out ? she asked .  Found out what , mother ?  That your name is Jonas . She evidently knows it . I could see that in her eyes .  She must have heard you calling me so . Ive told you more than once , ma , that you must never call me anything but Philip .  It is hard to have to keep silent always , never to speak to you as my own boy . I begin to think it is a dear price to pay , Jonas .  There you go again , mother! said Jonas , peevishly .  His mother had seated herself and spoke despondently .  I am afraid it will all come out some day , she said .  It will if you dont take better care , ma . I tell you , it would be the best thing for you to go away . Mr . Granville will give you a good income . If I was left alone , thered be no fear of its leaking out .  Oh , Jonas! would you really have me leave you ? Would you really have me live by myself , separated from my only child ?  Cold as she was , her heart was keenly wounded , for , looking at the boy , she saw that he was in earnest , and that he would prefer to have her go , since thereby he would be safer in the position he had usurped .    CHAPTER XXXVIII .  AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY .  Mr . Carter , can you spare me a couple of days ? asked Philip .  Certainly , Phil , answered the old gentleman . May I ask how you wish to dispose of the time ?  I would like to go to Planktown to see my friends there . It is now some months since I left the village , and I would like to see my old friends .  The desire is a natural one . Your home is broken up , is it not ?  Yes , but I can stay at the house of Tommy Kavanagh . I know he will be glad to have me .  It is strange that your step-mother and her son have left no trace behind them , said Mr . Carter thoughtfully . It looks suspicious , as if they had some good reason for their disappearance .  I cant understand why they should have left Planktown , said Philip , appearing puzzled .  Is the house occupied ?  Yes . I hear that a cousin of Mrs . Brent occupies it . I shall call and inquire after her .  Very well , Philip . Go when you please . You may be sure of a welcome when you return .  In Planktown , though his home relations latterly had not been pleasant , Philip had many friends , and when he appeared on the street , he met everywhere glances of friendly welcome . One of the first to meet him was Tommy Kavanagh .  Where did you come from , Phil ? he asked .  I am glad enough to see you . Where are you staying ?  Nowhere , Tommy , at present . If your mother can take me in , I will stay at your house .  Take you ? Yes , and will be glad enough to have you stay with us . You know we live in a small house , but if you dont mind----  What do you take me for , Tommy ? Whatever is good enough for you and your mother will be good enough for me .  What are you doing , Phil ? You dont look as if you had hard work making a living .  I am well fixed now , but I have had some anxious days . But alls well that ends well . I am private secretary to a rich man , and live in a fine brown-stone house on Madison Avenue .  Good for you , Phil! I knew youd succeed .  Where is Mrs . Brent ? Has anything been heard from her ?  I dont think anybody in the village knows where she is--that is , except her cousin , who lives in your old house .  What is his name ?  Hugh Raynor .  What sort of a man is he ?  The people in the village dont like him . He lives alone , and I hear that he cooks for himself . He is not at all social , and no one feels very much acquainted with him .  I shall call upon him and inquire after Mrs . Brent .  Then , Phil , you had better go alone , for he doesnt like callers , and he will be more ready to receive one than two .  Philip enjoyed his visit , and was busied making calls on his old acquaintances . He was much pleased with the cordiality with which he had been received .  It was not till the afternoon of the second day that he turned his steps toward the house which had been his home for so long a time .  We will precede him , and explain matters which made his visit very seasonable .  In the sitting-room sat Hugh Raynor , the present occupant of the house . He was a small , dark-complexioned man , with a large Roman nose , and his face was at this moment expressive of discontent . This seemed to be connected with a letter which he had just been reading . Not to keep the reader in suspense , it was mailed at Chicago , and was written by Mrs . Brent . We will quote a paragraph:  You seem to me very unreasonable in expecting me not only to give you the house rent-free , but also to give you a salary . I would like to know what you do to merit a salary . You merely take care of the house . As for that , there are plenty who would be glad to take charge of so good a house , and pay me a fair rent . Indeed , I am thinking that it will be best for me to make some such arrangement , especially as you do not seem satisfied with your sinecure position . You represent me as rolling in wealth . Jonas and I are living very comfortably , and we have nothing to complain of , but that is no reason for my squandering the small fortune left me by my husband . I advise you to be a little more reasonable in your demands , or I shall request you to leave my house .   Selfish as ever , muttered Mr . Raynor , after reading this letter over again . Cousin Jane never was willing that any one else should prosper . But she has made a mistake in thinking she can treat me meanly . I AM IN A POSITION TO TURN THE TABLES UPON HER! This paper--if she dreamed I had found it , she would yield to all my demands .  He laid his hand upon a paper , folded lengthwise , and presenting the appearance of a legal document .  He opened the paper and read aloud:   To the boy generally known as Philip Brent and supposed , though incorrectly , to be my son , I bequeath the sum of five thousand dollars , and direct the same to be paid over to any one whom he may select as guardian , to hold in trust for him until he attains the age of twenty-one .  This will Mrs . Brent carefully concealed , continued Mr . Raynor , in order to save the money for herself and Jonas . I wonder she was not prudent enough to burn it , or , at any rate , to take it with her when she left Planktown . It is a damaging secret , but I hold it , and I mean to use it , too . Let me see , what is it best to do ?  Mr . Raynor spent some time in quiet thought . It seemed to him that it might be well to hint his discovery in a letter to Mrs . Brent , and to make it the basis of a demand for a generous sum of hush-money--one thousand dollars , at least . He might have decided to do this but for an incident which suggested another course .  The door-bell rang , and when he opened the door with some surprise , for callers were few , he saw standing before him a tall , handsome boy , whom he did not recognize .  Do you wish to see me ? he asked . What is your name ?  My name is Philip Brent .  What! exclaimed Mr . Raynor , in visible excitement , are you the son of the late Mr . Brent ?  I was always regarded as such , answered Philip .  Come in , then . I am glad to see you , said Mr . Raynor; and Phil entered the house , surprised at a reception much more cordial than he had expected .  In that brief moment Mr . Raynor had decided to reveal the secret to Phil , and trust to his gratitude for a suitable acknowledgment . In this way he would revenge himself upon Mrs . Brent , who had treated him so meanly .  I have been wishing to see you , for I have a secret of importance to communicate , said Mr . Raynor .  If it relates to my parents , I know it already , said Phil .  No; it is something to your advantage . In revealing it I make Mrs . Brent my enemy , and shall forfeit the help she is giving me .  If it is really of advantage to me , and I am able to make up your loss to you , I will do it , said Phil .  That is sufficient . I will trust to your honor . You look like a boy who will keep a promise though not legally bound .  You only do me justice , Mr . Raynor .  Then cast your eye upon this paper and you will know the secret .  Is it a will ? exclaimed Phil , in surprise .  Yes , it is the will of the late Gerald Brent . By it he bequeaths to you five thousand dollars .  Then he did not forget me , said Phil , more pleased with the assurance that he had been remembered than by the sum of money bequeathed to him . But why have I not known this before ? he asked , looking up from the will .  You must ask that of Mrs . Brent! said Mr . Raynor significantly .  Do you think she suppressed it purposely ?  I do , answered Raynor laconically .  I must see her . Where can I find her ?  I can only say that her letters to me are mailed in Chicago , but she scrupulously keeps her address a secret .  Then I must go to Chicago . May I take this paper with me ?  Yes . I advise you to put it into the hands of a lawyer for safe keeping . You will not forget that you are indebted to me for it ?  No , Mr . Raynor . I will take care you lose nothing by your revelation .  The next morning Phil returned to New York .    CHAPTER XXXIX .  AT THE PALMER HOUSE .  It may be readily supposed that Phils New York friends listened with the greatest attention to his account of what he had learned in his visit to Planktown .  Your step-mother is certainly an unscrupulous woman , said Mr . Carter . Doubtless she has left your old town in order to escape accountability to you for your stolen inheritance . What puzzles me however , is her leaving behind such tell-tale evidence . It is a remarkable oversight . Do you think she is aware of the existence of the will ?  I think she must be , though I hope not , answered Phil . I should like to think that she had not conspired to keep back my share of fathers estate .  At any rate , the first thing to do is evidently to find her out , and confront her with the evidence of her crime--that is , supposing her to be really culpable .  Then you approve of my going to Chicago ? said Phil .  Most emphatically . Nay , more--I will go with you .  Will you indeed , sir ? said Phil joyfully . You are very kind . I shrank from going alone , being a boy ignorant of business .  A pretty shrewd boy , however , said Mr . Carter , smiling . I dont claim much credit , however , as I have some interests in Chicago to which I can attend with advantage personally . I am interested in a Western railroad , the main office of which is in that city .  When shall we go , sir ?  To-morrow , answered Mr . Carter promptly . The sooner the better . You may go down town and procure the necessary tickets , and engage sleeping-berths .  Here followed the necessary directions , which need not be repeated .  It is enough to say that twenty-four hours later Phil and his employer were passengers on a lightning express train bound for Chicago .  They arrived in due season , without any adventure worth naming , and took rooms at the Palmer House .  Now , it so happened that in the same hotel at the very same moment were three persons in whom Phil was vitally interested . These were Mrs . Brent , Jonas , otherwise called Philip Granville , and Mr . Granville himself .  Let me explain their presence in Chicago , when , as we know , Mr . Granvilles house was situated at some distance away .  Jonas had preferred a petition to go to Chicago for a week , in order to attend some of the amusements there to be enjoyed , alleging that it was awfully dull in the country .  Mr . Granville was inclined to be very indulgent , to make up for the long years in which he had been compelled practically to desert his son . The petition therefore received favor .  It is only natural that you should wish to see something of the city , my son , he said . I will grant your request . We will go to Chicago , and remain a week at the Palmer House . Mrs . Brent , will you accompany us ?  With pleasure , Mr . Granville , answered that lady . It is not dull here for me , still I shall no doubt enjoy a little excitement . At any rate , I shall be best pleased to be where you and your son are .  Then so let it be . We will go to-morrow .  One secret wish and scheme of Mrs . Brent has not been referred to . She felt that her present position was a precarious one . She might at any time be found out , and then farewell to wealth and luxury! But if she could induce Mr . Granville to marry her , she would then be secure , even if found out , and Jonas would be the son of Mr . Granville , though detected as a usurper . She , therefore , made herself as agreeable as possible to Mr . Granville , anticipated his every wish , and assumed the character , which she did not possess , of a gracious and feminine woman of unruffled good humor and sweetness of disposition .  I say , ma , Jonas observed on one occasion , youve improved ever so much since you came here . Youre a good deal better natured than you were .  Mrs . Brent smiled , but she did not care to take her son into her confidence .  Here I have no cares to trouble me , she said . I live here in a way that suits me .  But when they were about starting for Chicago , Mrs . Brent felt herself becoming unaccountably depressed .  Jonas , she said , I am sorry we are going to Chicago .  Why , ma ? Well have a splendid time .  I feel as if some misfortune were impending over us , said his mother , and she shivered apprehensively .  But it was too late to recede . Besides , Jonas wished to go , and she had no good reason to allege for breaking the arrangement .    CHAPTER XL .  A SCENE NOT ON THE BILLS .  Phil was in Chicago , but that was only the first step toward finding those of whom he was in search . Had he been sure that they were in the city , it would have simplified matters , but the fact that Mrs . Brent directed her letters to be sent to that city proved nothing . It did not make it certain that she lived in the town .  We are only at the beginning of our perplexities , Philip , said Mr . Carter . Your friends may be near us , or they may be a hundred miles away .  That is true , sir .  One method of finding them is barred , that of advertising , since they undoubtedly do not care to be found , and an advertisement would only place them on their guard .  What would you advise , sir ?  We might employ a detective to watch the post-office , but here again there might be disappointment . Mrs . Brent might employ a third person to call for her letters . However , I have faith to believe that sooner or later we shall find her . Time and patience accomplishes much .  Were you ever a detective , sir ? asked Phil , smiling .  No , Philip , but I have had occasion to employ them . Now how would you like to go to the theater this evening ?  Very much , sir .  There is a good play running at McVickers Theatre . We will go there .  Anywhere will suit me , Mr . Carter .  Young people are easily satisfied , he said . When they get older they get more fastidious . However , there is generally something attractive at McVickers .  It so happened that Philip and his employer took a late dinner , and did not reach the theater till ten minutes after the hour . They had seats in the seventh row of orchestra chairs , a very eligible portion of the house .  The curtain had risen , and Philips attention was given to the stage till the end of the first act . Then he began to look around him .  Suddenly he started and half rose from his seat .  What is the matter , Philip ? asked Mr . Carter .  There , sir! look there! said the boy , in excitement , pointing to two persons in the fourth row in front .  Do you recognize acquaintances , Philip ?  It is my step-mother and Jonas , answered Philip eagerly .  It is , indeed , wonderful! said Mr . Carter , sharing the boys excitement . You are confident , are you ?  Oh , sir , I couldnt be mistaken about that .  Just then Mrs . Brent turned to a gentleman at her side and spoke . It was Mr . Granville .  Who is that gentleman ? said Mr . Carter reflectively . Do you think Mrs . Brent is married again ?  I dont know what to think! said Philip , bewildered .  I will tell you what to do . You cannot allow these people to elude you . Go to the hotel , ask a direction to the nearest detective office , have a man detailed to come here directly , and let him find , if necessary , where your step-mother and her son are living .  Philip did so , and it was the close of the second act before he returned . With him was a small , quiet gentleman , of unpretending appearance , but skilled as a detective .  Now , continued Mr . Carter , you may venture at any time to go forward and speak to your friends--if they can be called such .  I dont think they can , sir . I wont go till the last intermission .  Phil was forestalled , however . At the close of the fourth act Jonas happened to look back , and his glance fell upon Philip .  A scared , dismayed look was on his face as he clutched his mothers arm and whispered:  Ma , Philip is sitting just back of us .  Mrs . Brents heart almost ceased to beat . She saw that the moment of exposure was probably at hand .  With pale face she whispered:  Has he seen us ?  He is looking right at us .  She had time to say no more . Philip left his seat , and coming forward , approached the seat of his step-mother .  How do you do , Mrs . Brent ? he said .  She stared at him , but did not speak .  How are you , Jonas ? continued our hero .  My name isnt Jonas , muttered the boy addressed .  Mr . Granville meanwhile had been eagerly looking at Philip . There appeared to be something in his appearance which riveted the attention of the beholder . Was it the voice of nature which spoke from the striking face of the boy ?  You have made a mistake , boy , said Mrs . Brent , summoning all her nerve . I am not the lady you mention , and this boy does not bear the name of Jonas .  What is his name , then ? demanded Philip .  My name is Philip Granville , answered Jonas quickly .  Is it ? Then it has changed suddenly , answered Phil , in a sarcastic voice . Six months ago , when we were all living at Planktown , your name was Jonas Webb .  You must be a lunatic! said Mrs . Brent , with audacious falsehood .  My own name is Philip , as you very well know .  Your name Philip ? exclaimed Mr . Granville , with an excitement which he found it hard to control .  Yes , sir; the lady is my step-mother , and this boy is her son Jonas .  And you--whose son are you ? gasped Mr . Granville .  I dont know , sir . I was left at an early age at a hotel kept by this ladys husband , by my father , who never returned .  Then YOU must be my son! said Mr . Granville . You and not this boy!  You , sir ? Did you leave me ?  I left my son with Mr . Brent . This lady led me to believe that the boy at my side was my son .  Here , then , was a sudden and startling occurrence . Mrs . Brent fainted . The strain had been too much for her nerves , strong as they were . Of course she must be attended to .  Come with me; I cannot lose sight of you now , MY SON! said Mr . Granville . Where are you staying ?  At the Palmer House .  So am I . Will you be kind enough to order a carriage .  Mrs . Brent was conveyed to the hotel , and Jonas followed sullenly .  Of course Philip , Mr . Granville and Mr . Carter left the theater .  Later the last three held a conference in the parlor .  It took little to convince Mr . Granville that Philip was his son .  I am overjoyed! he said . I have never been able to feel toward the boy whom you call Jonas as a father should . He was very distasteful to me .  It was an extraordinary deception on the part of Mrs . Brent , said Mr . Carter thoughtfully .  She is a very unprincipled woman , said Mr . Granville . Even now that matters have come right , I find it hard to forgive her .  You do not know all the harm she has sought to do your son . The sum of five thousand dollars was left him by Mr . Brent , and she suppressed the will .  Good heavens! is this true ?  We have the evidence of it .  *****  The next day an important interview was held at the Palmer House . Mrs . Brent was forced to acknowledge the imposition she had practiced upon Mr . Granville .  What could induce you to enter into such a wicked conspiracy ? asked Mr . Granville , shocked .  The temptation was strong--I wished to make my son rich . Besides , I hated Philip .  It is well your wicked plan has been defeated; it might have marred my happiness forever .  What are you going to do with me ? she asked coolly , but not without anxiety .  It was finally settled that the matter should be hushed up . Philip wished to give up the sum bequeathed him by Mr . Brent; but to this Mr . Granville objected , feeling that it would constitute a premium on fraud . Besides , Mrs . Brent would have the residue of the estate , amounting to nearly ten thousand dollars . Being allowed to do what he chose with this money , he gave it in equal portions to Tommy Kavanagh and Mr . Raynor , who had informed him of the existence of Mr . Brents will .  Mrs . Brent decided not to go back to Planktown . She judged that the story of her wickedness would reach that village and make it disagreeable for her . She opened a small millinery store in Chicago , and is doing fairly well . But Jonas is her chief trouble , as he is lazy and addicted to intemperate habits . His chances of success and an honorable career are small .  How can I spare you , Philip ? said Mr . Carter regretfully . I know your father has the best right to you , but I dont like to give you up .  You need not , said Mr . Granville . I propose to remove to New York; but in the summer I shall come to my estate near Chicago , and hope , since the house is large enough , that I may persuade you and your niece , Mrs . Forbush , to be my guests .  This arrangement was carried out . Mrs . Forbush and her daughter are the recognized heirs of Mr . Carter , who is wholly estranged from the Pitkins . He ascertained , through a detective , that the attack upon Philip by the man who stole from him the roll of bills was privately instigated by Mr . Pitkin himself , in the hope of getting Philip into trouble . Mr . Carter , thereupon , withdrew his capital from the firm , and Mr . Pitkin is generally supposed to be on the verge of bankruptcy . At any rate , his credit is very poor , and there is a chance that the Pitkins may be reduced to comparative poverty .  I wont let Lavinia suffer , said Uncle Oliver; if the worst comes to the worst , I will settle a small income , say twelve hundred dollars , on her , but we can never be friends .  As Phil grew older--he is now twenty-one--it seems probable that he and Mr . Carter may be more closely connected , judging from his gallant attentions to Julia Forbush , who has developed into a charming young lady . Nothing would suit Mr . Carter better , for there is no one who stands higher in his regard than Philip Granville , the Errand Boy .     FRED SARGENTS REVENGE .  Fred Sargent , upon this day from which my story dates , went to the head of his Latin class , in the high school of Andrewsville . The school was a fine one , the teachers strict , the classes large , the boys generally gentlemanly , and the moral tone pervading the whole , of the very best character .  To lead a class in a school like this was an honor of which any boy might have been proud; and Fred , when he heard his name read off at the head of the roll , could have thrown up his well-worn Latin grammar , which he happened to have in his hand just at that moment , and hurrahed . It was quite a wonder to him afterward that he did not .  As a class , boys are supposed to be generous . I really dont know whether they deserve to be considered so or not , but some four or five only in this large school envied Fred . The rest would probably have hurrahed with him; for Fred was a capital good fellow , and quite a favorite .  Bully for you! whispered Ned Brown , his right-hand neighbor; but Ned was instantly disgraced , the eye of the teacher catching the words as they dropped from his lips .  When school was over several of the boys rushed to the spot where Fred--his cap in his hand , and his dark hair blowing about every way--was standing .  I say , said James Duncan , I thought you would get it . Youve worked like a Trojan and you deserve it .  Its as good as getting the valedictory , said Joe Stone .  And that is entering into any college in the land without an examination , said Peter Crane .  Now Peter had run shoulder to shoulder with Fred and it does him great credit that , being beaten , he was thoroughly good-natured about it .  I say , Fred , you ought to treat for this; and Noah Holmes , standing on tiptoe , looked over the heads of the other boys significantly at Fred .  I wish I could; but heres all the money Ive got , said Fred , taking about twenty-five cents from his pocket--all that was left of his monthly allowance .  Thats better than nothing . It will buy an apple apiece . Come on! Lets go down to old Grangers . I saw some apples there big as your head; and bigger , too , said Noah , with a droll wink .  Well , come on , then; and away went the boys at Freds heels , pushing and shouting , laughing and frolicking , until they came to Abel Grangers little grocery .  Now hush up , you fellows , said Noah , turning round upon them . Let Fred go in by himself . Old Grange cant abide a crowd and noise . It will make him cross , and all we shall get will be the specked and worm-eaten ones . Come , fall back , there!  Very quietly and obediently the boys , who always knew their leader , fell back , and Fred went into the little dark grocery alone .  He was so pleasant and gentlemanly that , let him go where he would and do what he would , in some mysterious way he always found the right side of people and got what he wanted , in the most satisfactory manner .  Now Abel Granger was as cross as a meat axe . Noah said , and all the boys were afraid of him . If the apples had been anywhere else they would have been much surer of their treat; but in spite of their fears , back came Fred in a few moments , with a heaping measure of nice red apples--apples that made the boys mouths water .  Fred said that old Abel had given him as near a smile as could come to his yellow , wrinkled face .  Treat em , he said , treat em , eh ? Wal , now , pears likely theyd eat you out of house and home . I never see a boy yet that couldnt go through a tenpenny nail , easy as not .  We ARE always hungry , I believe , said Fred .  Allers , allers--thats a fact , picking out the best apples as he spoke and heaping up the measure . There , now if youll find a better lot than that , for the money , you are welcome to it , thats all .  Couldnt do it . Thank you very much , said Fred .  As the boys took the apples eagerly and began to bite them , they saw the old face looking out of the dirty panes of window glass upon them .  Fred loved to make everybody happy around him , and this treating was only second best to leading his class; so when , at the corner of the street turning to his fathers house , he parted from his young companions , I doubt whether there was a happier boy in all Andrewsville .  I do not think we shall blame him very much if he unconsciously carried his head pretty high and looked proudly happy .  Out from under the low archway leading to Bill Crandons house a boy about as tall as Fred , but stout and coarse , in ragged clothes , stood staring up and down the street as Fred came toward him .  Something in Freds looks and manner seemed especially to displease him . He moved directly into the middle of the sidewalk , and squared himself as if for a fight .  There was no other boy in town whom Fred disliked so much , and of whom he felt so afraid .  Sam Crandon , everybody knew , was a bully . He treated boys who were larger and stronger than himself civilly , but was cruel and domineering over the poor and weak .  So far in his life , though they met often , Fred had avoided coming into contact with Sam , and Sam had seemed to feel just a little awe of him; for Mr . Sargent was one of the wealthiest leading men in town , and Sam , in spite of himself , found something in the handsome , gentlemanly boy that held him in check; but to-day Sams father had just beaten him , and the boy was smarting from the blows .  I dare say he was hungry , and uncomfortable from many other causes; but however this may have been , he felt in the mood for making trouble; for seeing somebody else unhappy beside himself . This prosperous , well-dressed boy , with his books under his arm , and his happy face , was the first person he had come across--and here then was his opportunity .  Fred saw him assume the attitude of a prize fighter and knew what it meant . Sam had a cut , red and swollen , across one cheek , and this helped to make his unpleasant face more ugly and lowering than usual .  What was to be done ? To turn and run never occurred to Fred . To meet him and fight it out was equally impossible; so Fred stopped and looked at him irresolutely .  Youre afraid of a licking ? asked Sam , grinning ominously .  I dont want to fight , said Fred , quietly .  No more you dont , but youve got to .  Freds blood began to rise . The words and looks of the rough boy were a little too much for his temper .  Move out of the way , he said , walking directly up to him .  Sam hesitated for a moment . The steady , honest , bold look in Freds eyes was far more effective than a blow would have been; but as soon as Fred had passed him he turned and struck him a quick , stinging blow between his shoulders .  Thats mean , said Fred , wheeling round . Strike fair and in front if you want to , but dont hit in the back--thats a cowards trick .  Take it there , then , said Sam , aiming a heavy blow at Freds breast . But the latter skillfully raised his books , and Sams knuckles were the worse for the encounter .  Hurt , did it ? said Fred , laughing .  What if it did ?  Say quits , then .  Not by a good deal; and in spite of himself Fred was dragged into an ignominious street fight .  Oh , how grieved and mortified he was when his father , coming down the street , saw and called to him . Hearing his voice Sam ran away and Fred , bruised and smarting , with his books torn and his clothes , too , went over to his father .  Not a word did Mr . Sargent say . He took Freds hand in his , and the two walked silently to their home .  I doubt whether Mr . Sargent was acting wisely . Fred never had told him an untruth in his life , and a few words now might have set matters right . But to this roughness in boys Mr . Sargent had a special aversion . He had so often taken pains to instill its impropriety and vulgarity into Freds mind that he could not now imagine an excuse .  He should not have done so under any circumstances , said his father sternly , to himself . I am both surprised and shocked , and the punishment must be severe .  Unfortunately for Fred , his mother was out of town for a few days--a mother so much sooner than a father reaches the heart of her son--so now his father said:  You will keep your room for the next week . I shall send your excuse to your teacher . Ellen will bring your meals to you . At the end of that time I will see and talk with you .  Without a word Fred hung his cap upon its nail , and went to his room . Such a sudden change from success and elation to shame and condign punishment was too much for him .  He felt confused and bewildered . Things looked dark around him , and the great boughs of the Norway spruce , close up by his window , nodded and winked at him in a very odd way .  He had been often reproved , and sometimes had received a slight punishment , but never anything like this . And now he felt innocent , or rather at first he did not feel at all , everything was so strange and unreal .  He heard Ellen come into his room after a few minutes with his dinner , but he did not turn .  A cold numbing sense of disgrace crept over him . He felt as if , even before this Irish girl , he could never hold up his head again .  He did not wish to eat or do anything . What could it all mean ?  Slowly the whole position in which he was placed came to him . The boys gathering at school; the surprise with which his absence would be noted; the lost honor , so lately won; his fathers sad , grave face; his sisters unhappiness; his mothers sorrow; and even Sams face , so ugly in its triumph , all were there .  What an afternoon that was! How slowly the long hours dragged themselves away! And yet until dusk Fred bore up bravely . Then he leaned his head on his hands . Tired , hungry , worn out with sorrow , he burst into tears and cried like a baby .  Dont blame him . I think any one of us would have done the same .  Oh , mother! mother! said Fred aloud , to himself , do come home! do come home!  Ellen looked very sympathizing when she came in with his tea , and found his dinner untouched .  Eat your tea , Master Fred , she said , gently . The like of ye cant go without your victuals , no way . I dont know what youve done , but I aint afeared there is any great harm in it , though your collar is on crooked and theres a tear in your jacket , to say nothing of a black and blue place under your left eye . But eat your tea . Heres some fruit cake Biddy sent o purpose .  Somebody did think of and feel sorry for him! Fred felt comforted on the instant by Ellens kind words and Biddys plum cake; and I must say , ate a hearty , hungry boys supper; then went to bed and slept soundly until late the next morning .  We have not space to follow Fred through the tediousness of the following week . His father strictly carried out the punishment to the letter No one came near him but Ellen , though he heard the voices of his sisters and the usual happy home sounds constantly about him .  Had Fred really been guilty , even in the matter of a street fight , he would have been the unhappiest boy living during this time; but we know he was not , so we shall be glad to hear that with his books and the usual medley of playthings with which a boys room is piled , he contrived to make the time pass without being very wretched . It was the disgrace of being punished , the lost position in school , and above all , the triumph which it would be to Sam , which made him the most miserable . The very injustice of the thing was its balm in this case . May it be so , my young readers , with any punishment which may ever happen to you!  All these things , however , were opening the way to make Freds revenge , when it came , the more complete .  *****  Fred Sargent , of course , had lost his place , and was subjected to a great many curious inquiries when he returned to school .  He had done his best , in his room , to keep up with his class , but his books , studied in prison , as he had learned to call it , and in the sitting-room , with his sister Nellie and his mother to help him , were very different things . Still , doing your best always brings its reward; and let me say in passing , before the close of the month Fred had won his place again .  This was more easily done than satisfying the kind inquiries of the boys . So after trying the first day to evade them , Fred made a clean breast of it and told the whole story .  I think , perhaps , Mr . Sargents severe and unjust discipline had a far better effect upon the boys generally than upon Fred particularly . They did not know how entirely Fred had acted on the defensive , and so they received a lesson which most of them never forgot on the importance which a kind , genial man , with a smile and a cheery word for every child in town , attached to brawling .  After all , the worst effect of this punishment came upon Sam Crandon himself . Very much disliked as his wicked ways had made him before , he was now considered as a town nuisance . Everybody avoided him , and when forced to speak to him did so in the coldest , and often in the most unkind manner .  Sam , not three weeks after his wanton assault upon Fred , was guilty of his first theft and of drinking his first glass of liquor . In short , he was going headlong to destruction and no one seemed to think him worth the saving . Skulking by day , prowling by night--hungry , dirty , beaten and sworn at--no wonder that he seemed God-forsaken as well as man-forsaken .  Mr . Sargent had a large store in Rutgers street . He was a wholesale dealer in iron ware , and Andrewsville was such an honest , quiet town ordinary means were not taken to keep the goods from the hands of thieves .  Back doors , side doors and front doors stood open all the day , and no one went in or out but those who had dealings with the firm .  Suddenly , however , articles began to be missed--a package of knives , a bolt , a hatchet , an axe , a pair of skates , flat-irons , knives and forks , indeed hardly a day passed without a new thing being taken , and though every clerk in the store was on the alert and very watchful , still the thief , or thieves remained undetected .  At last matters grew very serious . It was not so much the pecuniary value of the losses--that was never large--but the uncertainty into which it threw Mr . Sargent . The dishonest person might be one of his own trusted clerks; such things had happened , and sad to say , probably would again .  Fred , said his father , one Saturday afternoon , I should like to have you come down to the store and watch in one of the rooms . There is a great run of business to-day , and the clerks have their hands more than full . I must find out , if possible who it is that is stealing so freely . Yesterday I lost six pearl-handled knives worth two dollars apiece . Can you come ?   Yes , sir , said Fred , promptly , I will be there at one , to a minute; and if I catch him , let him look out sharp , that is all .  This acting as police officer was new business to Fred and made him feel very important , so when the town clock was on the stroke of one he entered the store and began his patrol .  It was fun for the first hour , and he was so much on the alert that old Mr . Stone , from his high stool before the desk , had frequently to put his pen behind his ear and watch him . It was quite a scene in a play to see how Fred would start at the least sound . A mouse nibbling behind a box of iron chains made him beside himself until he had scared the little gray thing from its hole , and saw it scamper away out of the shop . But after the first hour the watching FOR NOTHING became a little tedious . There was a splendid game of base ball to come off on the public green that afternoon; and after that the boys were going to the Shaw-seen for a swim; then there was to be a picnic on the Indian Ridge , and--well , Fred had thought of all these losses when he so pleasantly assented to his fathers request , and he was not going to complain now . He sat down on a box , and commenced drumming tunes with his heels on its sides . This disturbed Mr . Stone . He looked at him sharply , so he stopped and sauntered out into a corner of the back store , where there was a trap-door leading down into the water . A small river ran by under the end of the store , also by the depot , which was near at hand , and his father used to have some of his goods brought down in boats and hoisted up through this door .  It was always one of the most interesting places in the store to Fred; he liked to sit with his feet hanging down over the water , watching it as it came in and dashed against the cellar walls .  To-day it was high , and a smart breeze drove it in with unusual force . Bending down as far as he could safely to look under the store , Fred saw the end of a hatchet sticking out from the corner of one of the abutments that projected from the cellar , to support the end of the store in which the trap-door was .  What a curious place this is for a hatchet! thought Fred , as he stooped a little further , holding on very tight to the floor above . What he saw made him almost lose his hold and drop into the water below . There , stretched along on a beam was Sam Crandon , with some stolen packages near him .  For a moment Freds astonishment was too great to allow him to speak; and Sam glared at him like a wild beast brought suddenly to bay .  Oh , Sam! Sam! said Fred , at length , how could you ?  Sam caught up a hatchet and looked as if he was going to aim it at him , then suddenly dropped it into the water .  Freds heart beat fast , and the blood came and went from his cheeks; he caught his breath heavily , and the water , the abutment and even Sam with his wicked ugly face were for a moment darkened . Then , recovering himself , he said:  Was it you , Sam ? Im sorry for you!  Dont lie! said Sam , glowering back , you know youre glad!  Glad ? Why should I be glad to have you steal ?  Cause I licked you , and you caught it .  So I did; but I am sorry , for all that .  You lie!  Fred had thought very fast while this conversation was going on . He had only to lift his head and call his father , then the boat would be immediately pushed in under the store , Sam secured and his punishment certain . There were stolen goods enough to convict him , and his mode of ingress into the store was now certain . This trap-door was never locked; very often it was left open--the water being considered the most effectual bolt and bar that could be used; but Sam , a good swimmer and climber , had come in without difficulty and had quite a store of his own hidden away there for future use . This course was very plain; but for some reason , which Fred could not explain even to himself , he did not feel inclined to take it; so he sat looking steadily in Sams face until he said:  Look here , Sam , I want to show you I mean what I say . Im sorry you have turned thief and if I can help you to be a better boy , I should be glad to .  Again Freds honest kindly face had the same effect upon Sam that it had at the commencement of their street fight; he respected and trusted it unconsciously .  Here! said he , crawling along on the beam and handing back the package of knives , the last theft of which his father had complained .  Yes , that is right , said Fred , leaning down and taking it , give them all back , if you can; that is what my father calls making restitution , and then you wont be a thief any longer .  Something in the boys tone touched Sams heart still more; so he handed back one thing after another as rapidly as he could until nearly everything was restored .  Bravo for you , Sam! I wont tell who took them , and there is a chance for you . Here , give me your hand now , honor bright youll never come here again to steal , if I dont tell my father .  Sam looked at him a moment , as if he would read his very soul; then he said sulkily:  Youll tell; I know you will , cause I licked you when you didnt want me to; but youve got em all back , and I spose it wont go very hard .  What wont go very hard ?  The prison .  You shant go to prison at all . Here , give me your hand; I promise not to tell if you will promise not to steal any more . Aint that fair ?  Yes , said Sam , a sudden change coming over his face , but you will!  Try me and see .  Sam slowly and really at a great deal of peril , considering his situation , put his rough , grimed hand into Freds--a dishonest hand it was , and that more than the other thing made Fred recoil a little as he touched it; but that clasp sealed the compact between these two boys . It began Fred Sargents revenge .  Now be off , will you , before the clerks come ? They will see the things and catch you here . Ill be round to your house soon and we will see .  Even in this short time Fred had formed a general plan for saving Sam .  The boy , stretching himself out flat , slipped down the transverse beam into the water , dived at once and came up under the bridge a few rods distant , then coolly passed down the river and swam to shore under a bunch of alder-bushes , by which he was concealed from the sight of the passers-by .  Fred sought his father , told him the story , then brought him to the spot , showed the goods which the boy had returned , and begged as a reward for the discovery to be allowed to conceal his name .  His father of course hesitated at so unusual a proposition; but there was something so very much in earnest in all Fred did and said that he became convinced it was best , for the present at least , to allow him to have his own way; and this he was very glad he had done when a few days after Fred asked him to do something for Sam Crandon .  Sam Crandon ? he asked in surprise . Is not that the very boy I found you fighting in the street with ?  Yes , sir , said Fred , hanging his head , but he promises to do well , if he can only find work--HONEST work; you see , sir , he is so bad nobody helps him .  Mr . Sargent smiled . A strange recommendation , Fred , he said , but I will try what can be done . A boy who wants to reform should have a helping hand .  He does want to--he wants to heartily; he says he does . Father , if you only will!  Fred , as he stood there , his whole face lit up with the glow of this generous , noble emotion , never was dearer to his fathers heart; indeed his fathers eyes were dim , and his voice a little husky , as he said again:  I will look after him , Fred , for your sake .  And so he did; but where and how I have not space now to tell my readers . Perhaps , at some future time , I may finish this story; for the present let me say there is a new boy in Mr . Sargents store , with rough , coarse face , voice and manners; everybody wonders at seeing him there; everybody prophesies future trouble; but nobody knows that this step up in Sam Crandons life is Fred Sargents revenge .     THE SMUGGLERS TRAP .  Hubert had accompanied his father on a visit to his uncle , who lived in a fine old country mansion , on the shore of Caermarthen Bay .  In front of the house spread a long beach , which terminated in precipitous cliffs and rocky ledges . On the afternoon of the day following his arrival , he declared his intention of exploring the beach .  Dont get caught in The Smugglers Trap , said his uncle , as he mentioned his plan .  The Smugglers Trap ?  Yes . Its at the end of the beach where you see the cliffs . Its a hollow cave , which you can only walk at very low tide . Youd better not go in there .  Oh , never fear , said Hubert carelessly , and in a few minutes he was wandering over the beach , and after walking about two miles reached the end of the beach at the base of the great cliffs .  The precipice towered frowningly overhead , its base all worn and furrowed by the furious surges that for ages had dashed against it . All around lay a chaos of huge boulders covered with seaweed . The tide was now at the lowest ebb . The surf here was moderate , for the seaweed on the rocks interfered with the swell of the waters , and the waves broke outside at some distance .  Between the base of the precipice and the edge of the water there was a space left dry by the ebb tide about two yards in width; and Hubert walked forward over the space thus uncovered to see what lay before him .  He soon found himself in a place which seemed like a fissure rent in a mountain side , by some extraordinary convulsion of nature . All around rose black , precipitous cliffs . On the side nearest was the precipice by whose base he had passed; while over opposite was a gigantic wall of dark rock , Which extended far out into the sea . Huge waves thundered at its feet and dashed their spray far upward into the air . The space was about fifty yards across .  The fissure extended back for about two hundred yards , and there terminated in a sharp angle formed by the abrupt walls of the cliffs which enclosed it . All around there were caverns worn into the base of the precipices by the action of the sea .  The floor of this place was gravelly , but near the water it was strewn with large boulders . Further in there were no boulders and it was easy to walk about .  At the furthest extremity there was a flat rock that seemed to have fallen from the cliff above in some former age . The cliffs around were about two hundred feet in height . They were perfectly bare , and intensely black . On their storm-riven summits not a sign of verdure appeared . Everything had the aspect of gloom , which was heightened by the mournful monotone of the sea waves as they dashed against the rock .  After the first feeling of awe had passed , Hubert ran forward , leaping from rock to rock , till he came to where the beach or floor of the fissure was gravelly . Over this he walked and hastened to the caverns , looking into them one after another .  Then he busied himself by searching among the pebbles for curious stones and shells . He found here numerous specimens of the rarest and finest treasures of the sea--shells of a delicacy of tint and perfection of outline; seaweeds of new and exquisite forms with rich hues which he had hitherto believed impossible .  In the hollows of the rocks , where the water yet lay in pools , he found little minnows; and delicate jelly fish , with their long slender fibers; and sea anemones; and sea urchins with their spires extended; and star-fish moving about with their innumerable creepers . It was a new world , a world which had thus far been only visible to him in the aquarium , and now as it stood before him he forgot all else .  He did not feel the wind as it blew in fresh from the sea--the dread souwester , the terror of fishermen . He did not notice the waves that rolled in more furiously from without , and were now beginning to break in wrath upon the rocky ledges and boulders . He did not see that the water had crept on nearer to the cliff , and that a white line of foam now lay on that narrow belt of beach which he had traversed at the foot of the cliff .  Suddenly a sound burst upon his ears that roused him , and sent all the blood back to his heart . It was his own name , called out in a voice of anguish and almost of despair by his father .  He sprang to his feet , started forward and rushed with the speed of the wind to the place by which he had entered the enclosure . But a barrier lay before him . The rolling waves were there , rushing in over the rocks , dashing against the cliff , tossing their white and quivering spray exulting in the air .  At once Hubert knew his danger .  He was caught in the Smugglers Trap , and the full meaning of his uncles warning flashed upon his mind as in his terror he shrieked back to his father .  Then there was silence for a time  While Hubert had been in the Trap , his father and uncle had been walking along the beach , and the former heard for the first time the nature and danger of the Smugglers Trap . He was at once filled with anxiety about his son , and had hurried to the place to call him back , when to his horror he found that the tide had already covered the only way by which the dangerous place might be approached .  No sooner had he heard Huberts answering cry than he rushed forward to try and save him . But the next moment a great wave came rolling in and dashed him upon the cliff . Terribly bruised , he clung to the cliff till the surf fell back , and then ran on again .  He slipped over a rock and fell , but instantly regaining his feet he advanced further , and in his haste fell into a hollow which was filled with water .  Before he could emerge another wave was upon him . This one beat him down , and it was only by clinging to the seaweed that he escaped being sucked back by the retreating surge . Bold and frenzied though he was , he had to start back from the fury of such an assault as this . He rushed backward and waited .  His eyes searched wildly around . He noticed that the surf grew more violent every moment , and every moment took away hope . But he would not yield .  Once more he rushed forward . The waves rolled in , but he grasped the rocks and withstood the surf , and still advanced . Another followed . He bowed before it , and clinging to the rocks as before came forth triumphant .  Already he was nearly halfway . He sprang upon a rock that rose above the level of the seething flood , and stood for a moment panting and gasping . But now a great wave came rolling in upon him . He fell on his knees and clung to the seaweed .  The wave struck . It hurled him from the rock . He rolled over and over . Blinded , bruised and half drowned , he felt himself dashed against the cliff . He threw his arms wildly about , but found nothing which he could seize . The retreating wave sucked him back . But a rock stayed him . This he grasped and was saved .  Then , hastily scrambling to his feet , he staggered back to the place from which he had started . Before he could get back another wave threw him down , and this time he might have been drowned had not his brother plunged in and dragged him out .  Of all this Hubert had seen nothing , and known nothing . He waited for some time in silence , and then called . There was no answer . He called again and again . But at that time his father was struggling with the waves and did not hear him . At last , after what seemed an interminable time , he heard once more his fathers voice . He shouted back .  Dont be afraid! cried the voice . Ill get you out . Wait .  And then there were no more voices .  It was about two oclock when Hubert had entered the gorge . It was after three when his father had roused him , and made his vain effort to save him . Hubert was now left alone with the rising tide , whose waters rolled forward with fearful rapidity . The beach inside was nearly level and he saw that in an hour or so it would be covered with the waters . He tried to trust to his fathers promise , but the precious moments passed and he began to look with terror upon the increasing storm; for every moment the wind grew fiercer , and the surf rolled in with ever increasing impetuosity .  He looked all around for a place of refuge , and saw nothing except the rock which arose at the extremity of the place , at the foot of the overhanging cliffs . It was about five feet high , and was the only place that afforded anything like safety .  Up this he clambered , and from this he could survey the scene , but only to perceive the full extent of his danger . For the tide rushed in more and more swiftly , the surf grew higher and higher and he saw plainly that before long the water would reach the summit of the rock , and that even before then the surf in its violence would sweep him away .  The moments passed slowly . Minutes seemed in his suspense to be transformed to hours . The sky was overspread now with black clouds; and the gloom increased . At length the waves rolled in until they covered all the beach in front , and began to dash against the rock on which he had taken refuge .  The precious moments passed . Higher and higher grew the waters . They came rolling into the cave , urged on by the fury of the billows outside , and heaping themselves up as they were compressed into this narrow gorge . They dashed up around the rock . The spray was tossed in his face . Already he felt their inexorable grasp . Death seemed so near that hope left him . He fell upon his knees with his hands clasped , and his white face upturned . Just then a great wave rolled up and flung itself over the rock , and over his knees as he knelt , and over his hands as he clasped them in prayer . A few more moments and all would be over .  As hope left a calmness came--the calmness that is born of despair . Face to face with death , he had tasted the bitterness of death , but now he flung aside the agony of his fear and rose to his feet , and his soul prepared itself for the end . Just then , in the midst of the uproar of wind and wave , there came a sudden sound , which roused to quick , feverish throbs the young lads heart . It was a voice--and sounded just above him:  HUBERT!  He looked up .  There far above him , in the gloom , he saw faces projecting over the edge of the cliff . The cry came again; he recognized the voice of his father .  For a moment Hubert could not speak . Hope returned . He threw up his arms wildly , and cried:  Make haste! Oh , make haste!  A rope was made fast about Huberts father , and he was let down over the edge of the cliff . He would allow no other than himself to undertake this journey .  He had hurried away and gathered a number of fishermen , whose stout arms and sinewy hands now held the rope by which he descended to save his son .  It was a perilous journey . The wind blew and the rope swayed more and more as it was let down , and sometimes he was dashed against the rocky sides of the precipice; but still he descended , and at last stood on the rock and clasped his son in his arms .  But there was no time to lose . Hubert mounted on his fathers shoulders , holding the rope while his father bound his boy close to him . Then the word was given , and they were slowly pulled up .  They reached the summit in safety , and as they reached it those who looked down through the gloom saw the white foam of the surf as it boiled in fury over the rock where Hubert had been standing . Part One   In which the Little Nugget is introduced to the reader , and plans are made for his future by several interested parties . In which , also , the future Mr Peter Burns is touched upon . The whole concluding with a momentous telephone-call .    THE LITTLE NUGGET     I   If the management of the Hotel Guelph , that London landmark , could have been present at three oclock one afternoon in early January in the sitting-room of the suite which they had assigned to Mrs Elmer Ford , late of New York , they might well have felt a little aggrieved . Philosophers among them would possibly have meditated on the limitations of human effort; for they had done their best for Mrs Ford . They had housed her well . They had fed her well . They had caused inspired servants to anticipate her every need . Yet here she was , in the midst of all these aids to a contented mind , exhibiting a restlessness and impatience of her surroundings that would have been noticeable in a caged tigress or a prisoner of the Bastille . She paced the room . She sat down , picked up a novel , dropped it , and , rising , resumed her patrol . The clock striking , she compared it with her watch , which she had consulted two minutes before . She opened the locket that hung by a gold chain from her neck , looked at its contents , and sighed . Finally , going quickly into the bedroom , she took from a suit-case a framed oil-painting , and returning with it to the sitting-room , placed it on a chair , and stepped back , gazing at it hungrily . Her large brown eyes , normally hard and imperious , were strangely softened . Her mouth quivered .  Ogden! she whispered .  The picture which had inspired this exhibition of feeling would probably not have affected the casual spectator to quite the same degree . He would have seen merely a very faulty and amateurish portrait of a singularly repellent little boy of about eleven , who stared out from the canvas with an expression half stolid , half querulous; a bulgy , overfed little boy; a little boy who looked exactly what he was , the spoiled child of parents who had far more money than was good for them .  As Mrs Ford gazed at the picture , and the picture stared back at her , the telephone bell rang . She ran to it eagerly . It was the office of the hotel , announcing a caller .  Yes ? Yes ? Who ? Her voice fell , as if the name was not the one she had expected . Oh , yes , she said . Yes , ask Lord Mountry to come to me here , please .  She returned to the portrait . The look of impatience , which had left her face as the bell sounded , was back now . She suppressed it with an effort as her visitor entered .  Lord Mountry was a blond , pink-faced , fair-moustached young man of about twenty-eight--a thick-set , solemn young man . He winced as he caught sight of the picture , which fixed him with a stony eye immediately on his entry , and quickly looked away .  I say , its all right , Mrs Ford . He was of the type which wastes no time on preliminary greetings . Ive got him .  Got him!  Mrs Fords voice was startled .  Stanborough , you know .  Oh! I--I was thinking of something else . Wont you sit down ?  Lord Mountry sat down .  The artist , you know . You remember you said at lunch the other day you wanted your little boys portrait painted , as you only had one of him , aged eleven--  This is Ogden , Lord Mountry . I painted this myself .  His lordship , who had selected a chair that enabled him to present a shoulder to the painting , and was wearing a slightly dogged look suggestive of one who turns no more his head , because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread , forced himself round , and met his gaze with as much nonchalance as he could summon up .  Er , yes , he said .  He paused .  Fine manly little fellow--what ? he continued .  Yes , isnt he ?  His lordship stealthily resumed his former position .  I recommended this fellow , Stanborough , if you remember . Hes a great pal of mine , and Id like to give him a leg up if I could . They tell me hes a topping artist . Dont know much about it myself . You told me to bring him round here this afternoon , you remember , to talk things over . Hes waiting downstairs .  Oh yes , yes . Of course , Ive not forgotten . Thank you so much , Lord Mountry .  Rather a good scheme occurred to me , that is , if you havent thought over the idea of that trip on my yacht and decided it would bore you to death . You still feel like making one of the party--what ?  Mrs Ford shot a swift glance at the clock .  Im looking forward to it , she said .  Well , then , why shouldnt we kill two birds with one stone ? Combine the voyage and the portrait , dont you know . You could bring your little boy along--hed love the trip--and Id bring Stanborough--what ?  This offer was not the outcome of a sudden spasm of warm-heartedness on his lordships part . He had pondered the matter deeply , and had come to the conclusion that , though it had flaws , it was the best plan . He was alive to the fact that a small boy was not an absolute essential to the success of a yachting trip , and , since seeing Ogdens portrait , he had realized still more clearly that the scheme had draw-backs . But he badly wanted Stanborough to make one of the party . Whatever Ogden might be , there was no doubt that Billy Stanborough , that fellow of infinite jest , was the ideal companion for a voyage . It would make just all the difference having him . The trouble was that Stanborough flatly refused to take an indefinite holiday , on the plea that he could not afford the time . Upon which his lordship , seldom blessed with great ideas , had surprised himself by producing the scheme he had just sketched out to Mrs Ford .  He looked at her expectantly , as he finished speaking , and was surprised to see a swift cloud of distress pass over her face . He rapidly reviewed his last speech . No , nothing to upset anyone in that . He was puzzled .  She looked past him at the portrait . There was pain in her eyes .  Im afraid you dont quite understand the position of affairs , she said . Her voice was harsh and strained .  Eh ?  You see--I have not-- She stopped . My little boy is not--Ogden is not living with me just now .  At school , eh ?  No , not at school . Let me tell you the whole position . Mr Ford and I did not get on very well together , and a year ago we were divorced in Washington , on the ground of incompatibility , and--and--  She choked . His lordship , a young man with a shrinking horror of the deeper emotions , whether exhibited in woman or man , writhed silently . That was the worst of these Americans! Always getting divorced and causing unpleasantness . How was a fellow to know ? Why hadnt whoever it was who first introduced them--he couldnt remember who the dickens it was--told him about this ? He had supposed she was just the ordinary American woman doing Europe with an affectionate dollar-dispensing husband in the background somewhere .  Er-- he said . It was all he could find to say .  And--and the court , said Mrs Ford , between her teeth , gave him the custody of Ogden .  Lord Mountry , pink with embarrassment , gurgled sympathetically .  Since then I have not seen Ogden . That was why I was interested when you mentioned your friend Mr Stanborough . It struck me that Mr Ford could hardly object to my having a portrait of my son painted at my own expense . Nor do I suppose that he will , when--if the matter is put to him . But , well , you see it would be premature to make any arrangements at present for having the picture painted on our yacht trip .  Im afraid it knocks that scheme on the head , said Lord Mountry mournfully .  Not necessarily .  Eh ?  I dont want to make plans yet , but--it is possible that Ogden may be with us after all . Something may be--arranged .  You think you may be able to bring him along on the yacht after all ?  I am hoping so .  Lord Mountry , however willing to emit sympathetic gurgles , was too plain and straightforward a young man to approve of wilful blindness to obvious facts .  I dont see how you are going to override the decision of the court . It holds good in England , I suppose ?  I am hoping something may be--arranged .  Oh , same here , same here . Certainly . Having done his duty by not allowing plain facts to be ignored , his lordship was ready to become sympathetic again . By the way , where is Ogden ?  He is down at Mr Fords house in the country . But--  She was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone bell . She was out of her seat and across the room at the receiver with what appeared to Lord Mountrys startled gaze one bound . As she put the instrument to her ear a wave of joy swept over her face . She gave a little cry of delight and excitement .  Send them right up at once , she said , and turned to Lord Mountry transformed .  Lord Mountry , she said quickly , please dont think me impossibly rude if I turn you out . Some--some people are coming to see me . I must--  His lordship rose hurriedly .  Of course . Of course . Certainly . Where did I put my--ah , here . He seized his hat , and by way of economizing effort , knocked his stick on to the floor with the same movement . Mrs Ford watched his bendings and gropings with growing impatience , till finally he rose , a little flushed but with a full hand--stick , gloves , and hat , all present and correct .  Good-bye , then , Mrs Ford , for the present . Youll let me know if your little boy will be able to make one of our party on the yacht ?  Yes , yes . Thank you ever so much . Good-bye .  Good-bye .  He reached the door and opened it .  By Jove , he said , springing round--Stanborough! What about Stanborough ? Shall I tell him to wait ? Hes down below , you know!  Yes , yes . Tell Mr Stanborough Im dreadfully sorry to have to keep him waiting , and ask him if he wont stay for a few minutes in the Palm Room .  Inspiration came to Lord Mountry .  Ill give him a drink , he said .  Yes , yes , anything . Lord Mountry , you really must go . I know Im rude . I dont know what Im saying . But--my boy is returning to me .  The accumulated chivalry of generations of chivalrous ancestors acted like a spur on his lordship . He understood but dimly , yet enough to enable him to realize that a scene was about to take place in which he was most emphatically not on . A mothers meeting with her long-lost child , this is a sacred thing . This was quite clear to him , so , turning like a flash , he bounded through the doorway , and , as somebody happened to be coming in at the same time , there was a collision , which left him breathing apologies in his familiar attitude of stooping to pick up his hat .  The new-comers were a tall , strikingly handsome girl , with a rather hard and cynical cast of countenance . She was leading by the hand a small , fat boy of about fourteen years of age , whose likeness to the portrait on the chair proclaimed his identity . He had escaped the collision , but seemed offended by it; for , eyeing the bending peer with cold distaste , he summed up his opinion of him in the one word Chump!  Lord Mountry rose .  I beg your pardon , he said for perhaps the seventh time . He was thoroughly unstrung . Always excessively shy , he was embarrassed now by quite a variety of causes . The world was full of eyes--Mrs Fords saying Go! Ogdens saying Fool! the portrait saying Idiot! and , finally , the eyes of this wonderfully handsome girl , large , grey , cool , amused , and contemptuous saying--so it seemed to him in that feverish moment--Who is this curious pink person who cumbers the ground before me ?  I--I beg your pardon . he repeated .  Ought to look where youre going , said Ogden severely .  Not at all , said the girl . Wont you introduce me , Nesta ?  Lord Mountry--Miss Drassilis , said Mrs Ford .  Im afraid were driving Lord Mountry away , said the girl . Her eyes seemed to his lordship larger , greyer , cooler , more amused , and more contemptuous than ever . He floundered in them like an unskilful swimmer in deep waters .  No , no , he stammered . Give you my word . Just going . Good-bye . You wont forget to let me know about the yacht , Mrs Ford--what ? Itll be an awfully jolly party . Good-bye , good-bye , Miss Drassilis .  He looked at Ogden for an instant , as if undecided whether to take the liberty of addressing him too , and then , his heart apparently failing him , turned and bolted . From down the corridor came the clatter of a dropped stick .  Cynthia Drassilis closed the door and smiled .  A nervous young person! she said . What was he saying about a yacht , Nesta ?  Mrs Ford roused herself from her fascinated contemplation of Ogden .  Oh , nothing . Some of us are going to the south of France in his yacht next week .  What a delightful idea!  There was a certain pensive note in Cynthias voice .  A splendid idea! she murmured .  Mrs Ford swooped . She descended on Ogden in a swirl and rustle of expensive millinery , and clasped him to her .  My boy!  It is not given to everybody to glide neatly into a scene of tense emotion . Ogden failed to do so . He wriggled roughly from the embrace .  Got a cigarette ? he said .  He was an extraordinarily unpleasant little boy . Physically the portrait standing on the chair did him more than justice . Painted by a mothers loving hand , it flattered him . It was bulgy . He was more bulgy . It was sullen . He scowled . And , art having its limitations , particularly amateur art , the portrait gave no hint of his very repellent manner . He was an intensely sophisticated child . He had the air of one who has seen all life has to offer , and is now permanently bored . His speech and bearing were those of a young man , and a distinctly unlovable young man .  Even Mrs Ford was momentarily chilled . She laughed shakily .  How very matter-of-fact you are , darling! she said .  Cynthia was regarding the heir to the Ford millions with her usual steady , half-contemptuous gaze .  He has been that all day , she said . You have no notion what a help it was to me .  Mrs Ford turned to her effusively .  Oh , Cynthia , dear , I havent thanked you .  No , interpolated the girl dryly .  Youre a wonder , darling . You really are . Ive been repeating that ever since I got your telegram from Eastnor . She broke off . Ogden , come near me , my little son .  He lurched towards her sullenly .  Dont muss a fellow now , he stipulated , before allowing himself to be enfolded in the outstretched arms .  Tell me , Cynthia , resumed Mrs Ford , how did you do it ? I was telling Lord Mountry that I hoped I might see my Ogden again soon , but I never really hoped . It seemed too impossible that you should succeed .  This Lord Mountry of yours , said Cynthia . How did you get to know him ? Why have I not seen him before ?  I met him in Paris in the fall . He has been out of London for a long time , looking after his father , who was ill .  I see .  He has been most kind , making arrangements about getting Ogdens portrait painted . But , bother Lord Mountry . How did we get sidetracked on to him ? Tell me how you got Ogden away .  Cynthia yawned .  It was extraordinarily easy , as it turned out , you see .  Ogden , darling , observed Mrs Ford , dont go away . I want you near me .  Oh , all right .  Then stay by me , angel-face .  Oh , slush! muttered angel-face beneath his breath . Say , Im darned hungry , he added .  It was if an electric shock had been applied to Mrs Ford . She sprang to her feet .  My poor child! Of course you must have some lunch . Ring the bell , Cynthia . Ill have them send up some here .  Ill have mine here , said Cynthia .  Oh , youve had no lunch either! I was forgetting that .  I thought you were .  You must both lunch here .  Really , said Cynthia , I think it would be better if Ogden had his downstairs in the restaurant .  Want to talk scandal , eh ?  Ogden , dearest! said Mrs Ford . Very well , Cynthia . Go , Ogden . You will order yourself something substantial , marvel-child ?  Bet your life , said the son and heir tersely .  There was a brief silence as the door closed . Cynthia gazed at her friend with a peculiar expression .  Well , I did it , dear , she said .  Yes . Its splendid . Youre a wonder , darling .  Yes , said Cynthia .  There was another silence .  By the way , said Mrs Ford , didnt you say there was a little thing , a small bill , that was worrying you ?  Did I mention it ? Yes , there is . Its rather pressing . In fact , its taking up most of the horizon at present . Here it is .  Is it a large sum ? Mrs Ford took the slip of paper and gave a slight gasp . Then , coming to the bureau , she took out her cheque-book .  Its very kind of you , Nesta , said Cynthia . They were beginning to show quite a vindictive spirit about it .  She folded the cheque calmly and put it in her purse .  And now tell me how you did it , said Mrs Ford .  She dropped into a chair and leaned back , her hands behind her head . For the first time , she seemed to enjoy perfect peace of mind . Her eyes half closed , as if she had been making ready to listen to some favourite music .  Tell me from the very beginning , she said softly .  Cynthia checked a yawn .  Very well , dear , she said . I caught the 10 .20 to Eastnor , which isnt a bad train , if you ever want to go down there . I arrived at a quarter past twelve , and went straight up to the house--youve never seen the house , of course ? Its quite charming--and told the butler that I wanted to see Mr Ford on business . I had taken the precaution to find out that he was not there . He is at Droitwich .  Rheumatism , murmured Mrs Ford . He has it sometimes .  The man told me he was away , and then he seemed to think that I ought to go . I stuck like a limpet . I sent him to fetch Ogdens tutor . His name is Broster--Reggie Broster . He is a very nice young man . Big , broad shoulders , and such a kind face .  Yes , dear , yes ?  I told him I was doing a series of drawings for a magazine of the interiors of well-known country houses .  He believed you ?  He believed everything . Hes that kind of man . He believed me when I told him that my editor particularly wanted me to sketch the staircase . They had told me about the staircase at the inn . I forget what it is exactly , but its something rather special in staircases .  So you got in ?  So I got in .  And saw Ogden ?  Only for a moment--then Reggie--  Who ?  Mr Broster . I always think of him as Reggie . Hes one of Natures Reggies . Such a kind , honest face . Well , as I was saying , Reggie discovered that it was time for lessons , and sent Ogden upstairs .  By himself ?  By himself! Reggie and I chatted for a while .  Mrs Fords eyes opened , brown and bright and hard .  Mr Broster is not a proper tutor for my boy , she said coldly .  I suppose it was wrong of Reggie , said Cynthia . But--I was wearing this hat .  Go on .  Well , after a time , I said I must be starting my work . He wanted me to start with the room we were in . I said no , I was going out into the grounds to sketch the house from the EAST . I chose the EAST because it happens to be nearest the railway station . I added that I supposed he sometimes took Ogden for a little walk in the grounds . He said yes , he did , and it was just about due . He said possibly he might come round my way . He said Ogden would be interested in my sketch . He seemed to think a lot of Ogdens fondness for art .  Mr Broster is not a proper tutor for my boy .  Well , he isnt your boys tutor now , is he , dear ?  What happened then ?  I strolled off with my sketching things . After a while Reggie and Ogden came up . I said I hadnt been able to work because I had been frightened by a bull .  Did he believe that ?  Certainly he believed it . He was most kind and sympathetic . We had a nice chat . He told me all about himself . He used to be very good at football . He doesnt play now , but he often thinks of the past .  But he must have seen that you couldnt sketch . Then what became of your magazine commission story ?  Well , somehow the sketch seemed to get shelved . I didnt even have to start it . We were having our chat , you see . Reggie was telling me how good he had been at football when he was at Oxford , and he wanted me to see a newspaper clipping of a Varsity match he had played in . I said Id love to see it . He said it was in his suit-case in the house . So I promised to look after Ogden while he fetched it . I sent him off to get it just in time for us to catch the train . Off he went , and here we are . And now , wont you order that lunch you mentioned ? Im starving .  Mrs Ford rose . Half-way to the telephone she stopped suddenly .  My dear child! It has only just struck me! We must leave here at once . He will have followed you . He will guess that Ogden has been kidnapped .  Cynthia smiled .  Believe me , it takes Reggie quite a long time to guess anything . Besides , there are no trains for hours . We are quite safe .  Are you sure ?  Absolutely . I made certain of that before I left .  Mrs Ford kissed her impulsively .  Oh , Cynthia , you really are wonderful!  She started back with a cry as the bell rang sharply .  For goodness sake , Nesta , said Cynthia , with irritation , do keep control of yourself . Theres nothing to be frightened about . I tell you Mr Broster cant possibly have got here in the time , even if he knew where to go to , which I dont see how he could . Its probably Ogden .  The colour came back into Mrs Fords cheeks .  Why , of course .  Cynthia opened the door .  Come in , darling , said Mrs Ford fondly . And a wiry little man with grey hair and spectacles entered .  Good afternoon , Mrs Ford , he said . I have come to take Ogden back .     II   There are some situations in life so unexpected , so trying , that , as far as concerns our opinion of those subjected to them , we agree , as it were , not to count them; we refuse to allow the victims behaviour in circumstances so exacting to weigh with us in our estimate of his or her character . We permit the great general , confronted suddenly with a mad bull , to turn and run , without forfeiting his reputation for courage . The bishop who , stepping on a concealed slide in winter , entertains passers-by with momentary rag-time steps , loses none of his dignity once the performance is concluded .  In the same way we must condone the behaviour of Cynthia Drassilis on opening the door of Mrs Fords sitting-room and admitting , not Ogden , but this total stranger , who accompanied his entry with the remarkable speech recorded at the close of the last section .  She was a girl who prided herself on her carefully blase and supercilious attitude towards life; but this changeling was too much for her . She released the handle , tottered back , and , having uttered a discordant squeak of amazement , stood staring , eyes and mouth wide open .  On Mrs Ford the apparition had a different effect . The rather foolish smile of welcome vanished from her face as if wiped away with a sponge . Her eyes , fixed and frightened like those of a trapped animal , glared at the intruder . She took a step forward , choking .  What--what do you mean by daring to enter my room ? she cried .  The man held his ground , unmoved . His bearing was a curious blend of diffidence and aggressiveness . He was determined , but apologetic . A hired assassin of the Middle Ages , resolved to do his job loyally , yet conscious of causing inconvenience to his victim , might have looked the same .  I am sorry , he said , but I must ask you to let me have the boy , Mrs Ford .  Cynthia was herself again now . She raked the intruder with the cool stare which had so disconcerted Lord Mountry .  Who is this gentleman ? she asked languidly .  The intruder was made of tougher stuff than his lordship . He met her eye with quiet firmness .  My name is Mennick , he said . I am Mr Elmer Fords private secretary .  What do you want ? said Mrs Ford .  I have already explained what I want , Mrs Ford . I want Ogden .  Cynthia raised her eyebrows .  What does he mean , Nesta ? Ogden is not here .  Mr Mennick produced from his breast-pocket a telegraph form , and in his quiet , business-like way proceeded to straighten it out .  I have here , he said , a telegram from Mr Broster , Ogdens tutor . It was one of the conditions of his engagement that if ever he was not certain of Ogdens whereabouts he should let me know at once . He tells me that early this afternoon he left Ogden in the company of a strange young lady--Mr Mennicks spectacles flashed for a moment at Cynthia--and that , when he returned , both of them had disappeared . He made inquiries and discovered that this young lady caught the 1 .15 express to London , Ogden with her . On receipt of this information I at once wired to Mr Ford for instructions . I have his reply--he fished for and produced a second telegram--here .  I still fail to see what brings you here , said Mrs Ford . Owing to the gross carelessness of his fathers employees , my son appears to have been kidnapped . That is no reason--  I will read Mr Fords telegram , proceeded Mr Mennick unmoved . It is rather long . I think Mr Ford is somewhat annoyed . The boy has obviously been stolen by some hireling of his mothers . I am reading Mr Fords actual words , he said , addressing Cynthia with that touch of diffidence which had marked his manner since his entrance .  Dont apologize , said Cynthia , with a short laugh . Youre not responsible for Mr Fords rudeness .  Mr Mennick bowed .  He continued: Remove him from her illegal restraint . If necessary call in police and employ force .  Charming! said Mrs Ford .  Practical , said Mr Mennick . There is more . Before doing anything else sack that fool of a tutor , then go to Agency and have them recommend good private school for boy . On no account engage another tutor . They make me tired . Fix all this today . Send Ogden back to Eastnor with Mrs Sheridan . She will stay there with him till further notice . That is Mr Fords message .  Mr Mennick folded both documents carefully and replaced them in his pocket .  Mrs Ford looked at the clock .  And now , would you mind going , Mr Mennick ?  I am sorry to appear discourteous , Mrs Ford , but I cannot go without Ogden .  I shall telephone to the office to send up a porter to remove you .  I shall take advantage of his presence to ask him to fetch a policeman .  In the excitement of combat the veneer of apologetic diffidence was beginning to wear off Mr Mennick . He spoke irritably . Cynthia appealed to his reason with the air of a bored princess descending to argument with a groom .  Cant you see for yourself that hes not here ? she said . Do you think we are hiding him ?  Perhaps you would like to search my bedroom ? said Mrs Ford , flinging the door open .  Mr Mennick remained uncrushed .  Quite unnecessary , Mrs Ford . I take it , from the fact that he does not appear to be in this suite , that he is downstairs making a late luncheon in the restaurant .  I shall telephone--  And tell them to send him up . Believe me , Mrs Ford , it is the only thing to do . You have my deepest sympathy , but I am employed by Mr Ford and must act solely in his interests . The law is on my side . I am here to fetch Ogden away , and I am going to have him .  You shant!  I may add that , when I came up here , I left Mrs Sheridan--she is a fellow-secretary of mine . You may remember Mr Ford mentioning her in his telegram--I left her to search the restaurant and grill-room , with instructions to bring Ogden , if found , to me in this room .  The door-bell rang . He went to the door and opened it .  Come in , Mrs Sheridan . Ah!  A girl in a plain , neat blue dress entered the room . She was a small , graceful girl of about twenty-five , pretty and brisk , with the air of one accustomed to look after herself in a difficult world . Her eyes were clear and steady , her mouth sensitive but firm , her chin the chin of one who has met trouble and faced it bravely . A little soldier .  She was shepherding Ogden before her , a gorged but still sullen Ogden . He sighted Mr Mennick and stopped .  Hello! he said . What have you blown in for ?  He was just in the middle of his lunch , said the girl . I thought you wouldnt mind if I let him finish .  Say , whats it all about , anyway ? demanded Ogden crossly . Cant a fellow have a bit of grub in peace ? You give me a pain .  Mr Mennick explained .  Your father wishes you to return to Eastnor , Ogden .  Oh , all right . I guess Id better go , then . Good-bye , ma .  Mrs Ford choked .  Kiss me , Ogden .  Ogden submitted to the embrace in sulky silence . The others comported themselves each after his or her own fashion . Mr Mennick fingered his chin uncomfortably . Cynthia turned to the table and picked up an illustrated paper . Mrs Sheridans eyes filled with tears . She took a half-step towards Mrs Ford , as if about to speak , then drew back .  Come , Ogden , said Mr Mennick gruffly . Necessary , this Hired Assassin work , but painful--devilish painful . He breathed a sigh of relief as he passed into the corridor with his prize .  At the door Mrs Sheridan hesitated , stopped , and turned .  Im sorry , she said impulsively .  Mrs Ford turned away without speaking , and went into the bedroom .  Cynthia laid down her paper .  One moment , Mrs Sheridan .  The girl had turned to go . She stopped .  Can you give me a minute ? Come in and shut the door . Wont you sit down ? Very well . You seemed sorry for Mrs Ford just now .  I am very sorry for Mrs Ford . Very sorry . I hate to see her suffering . I wish Mr Mennick had not brought me into this .  Nestas mad about that boy , said Cynthia . Heaven knows why . I never saw such a repulsive child in my life . However , there it is . I am sorry for you . I gathered from what Mr Mennick said that you were to have a good deal of Ogdens society for some time to come . How do you feel about it ?  Mrs Sheridan moved towards the door .  I must be going , she said . Mr Mennick will be waiting for me .  One moment . Tell me , dont you think , after what you saw just now , that Mrs Ford is the proper person to have charge of Ogden ? You see how devoted she is to him ?  May I be quite frank with you ?  Please .  Well , then , I think that Mrs Fords influence is the worst possible for Ogden . I am sorry for her , but that does not alter my opinion . It is entirely owing to Mrs Ford that Ogden is what he is . She spoiled him , indulged him in every way , never checked him--till he has become--well , what you yourself called him , repulsive .  Cynthia laughed .  Oh well , she said , I only talked that mothers love stuff because you looked the sort of girl who would like it . We can drop all that now , and come down to business .  I dont understand you .  You will . I dont know if you think that I kidnapped Ogden from sheer affection for Mrs Ford . I like Nesta , but not as much as that . No . Im one of the Get-Rich-Quick-Wallingfords , and Im looking out for myself all the time . Theres no one else to do it for me . Ive a beastly home . My fathers dead . My mothers a cat . So--  Please stop , said Mrs Sheridan . I dont know why you are telling me all this .  Yes , you do . I dont know what salary Mr Ford pays you , but I dont suppose its anything princely . Why dont you come over to us ? Mrs Ford would give you the earth if you smuggled Ogden back to her .  You seem to be trying to bribe me , said Mrs Sheridan .  In this case , said Cynthia , appearances arent deceptive . I am .  Good afternoon .  Dont be a little fool .  The door slammed .  Come back! cried Cynthia . She took a step as if to follow , but gave up the idea with a laugh . She sat down and began to read her illustrated paper again . Presently the bedroom door opened . Mrs Ford came in . She touched her eyes with a handkerchief as she entered . Cynthia looked up .  Im very sorry , Nesta , she said .  Mrs Ford went to the window and looked out .  Im not going to break down , if thats what you mean , she said . I dont care . And , anyhow , it shows that it can be done .  Cynthia turned a page of her paper .  Ive just been trying my hand at bribery and corruption .  What do you mean ?  Oh , I promised and vowed many things in your name to that secretary person , the female one--not Mennick--if she would help us . Nothing doing . I told her to let us have Ogden as soon as possible , C .O .D . , and she withered me with a glance and went .  Mrs Ford shrugged her shoulders impatiently .  Oh , let her go . Im sick of amateurs .  Thank you , dear , said Cynthia .  Oh , I know you did your best . For an amateur you did wonderfully well . But amateurs never really succeed . There were a dozen little easy precautions which we neglected to take . What we want is a professional; a man whose business is kidnapping; the sort of man who kidnaps as a matter of course; someone like Smooth Sam Fisher .  My dear Nesta! Who ? I dont think I know the gentleman .  He tried to kidnap Ogden in 1906 , when we were in New York . At least , the police put it down to him , though they could prove nothing . Then there was a horrible man , the police said he was called Buck MacGinnis . He tried in 1907 . That was in Chicago .  Good gracious! Kidnapping Ogden seems to be as popular as football . And I thought I was a pioneer!  Something approaching pride came into Mrs Fords voice .  I dont suppose theres a child in America , she said , who has had to be so carefully guarded . Why , the kidnappers had a special name for him--they called him The Little Nugget . For years we never allowed him out of our sight without a detective to watch him .  Well , Mr Ford seems to have changed all that now . I saw no detectives . I suppose he thinks they arent necessary in England . Or perhaps he relied on Mr Broster . Poor Reggie!  It was criminally careless of him . This will be a lesson to him . He will be more careful in future how he leaves Ogden at the mercy of anybody who cares to come along and snap him up .  Which , incidentally , does not make your chance of getting him away any lighter .  Oh , Ive given up hope now , said Mrs Ford resignedly .  I havent , said Cynthia .  There was something in her voice which made her companion turn sharply and look at her . Mrs Ford might affect to be resigned , but she was a woman of determination , and if the recent reverse had left her bruised , it had by no means crushed her .  Cynthia! What do you mean ? What are you hinting ?  You despise amateurs , Nesta , but , for all that , it seems that your professionals who kidnap as a matter of course and all the rest of it have not been a bit more successful . It was not my want of experience that made me fail . It was my sex . This is mans work . If I had been a man , I should at least have had brute force to fall back upon when Mr Mennick arrived .  Mrs Ford nodded .  Yes , but--  And , continued Cynthia , as all these Smooth Sam Fishers of yours have failed too , it is obvious that the only way to kidnap Ogden is from within . We must have some man working for us in the enemys camp .  Which is impossible , said Mrs Ford dejectedly .  Not at all .  You know a man ?  I know the man .  Cynthia! What do you mean ? Who is he ?  His name is Peter Burns .  Mrs Ford shook her head .  I dont know him .  Ill introduce you . Youll like him .  But , Cynthia , how do you know he would be willing to help us ?  He would do it for me , Cynthia paused . You see , she went on , we are engaged to be married .  My dear Cynthia! Why did you not tell me ? When did it happen ?  Last night at the Fletchers dance .  Mrs Fords eyes opened .  Last night! Were you at a dance last night ? And two railway journeys today! You must be tired to death .  Oh , Im all right , thanks . I suppose I shall be a wreck and not fit to be seen tomorrow , but just at present I feel as if nothing could tire me . Its the effect of being engaged , perhaps .  Tell me about him .  Well , hes rich , and good-looking , and amiable--Cynthia ticked off these qualities on her fingers--and I think hes brave , and hes certainly not so stupid as Mr Broster .  And youre very much in love with him ?  I like him . Theres no harm in Peter .  You certainly arent wildly enthusiastic!  Oh , we shall hit it off quite well together . I neednt pose to you , Nesta , thank goodness! Thats one reason why Im fond of you . You know how I am situated . Ive got to marry some one rich , and Peters quite the nicest rich man Ive ever met . Hes really wonderfully unselfish . I cant understand it . With his money , you would expect him to be a perfect horror .  A thought seemed to strike Mrs Ford .  But , if hes so rich-- she began . I forget what I was going to say , she broke off .  Dear Nesta , I know what you were going to say . If hes so rich , why should he be marrying me , when he could take his pick of half London ? Well , Ill tell you . Hes marrying me for one reason , because hes sorry for me: for another , because I had the sense to make him . He didnt think he was going to marry anyone . A few years ago he had a disappointment . A girl jilted him . She must have been a fool . He thought he was going to live the rest of his life alone with his broken heart . I didnt mean to allow that . Its taken a long time--over two years , from start to finish--but Ive done it . Hes a sentimentalist . I worked on his sympathy , and last night I made him propose to me at the Fletchers dance .  Mrs Ford had not listened to these confidences unmoved . Several times she had tried to interrupt , but had been brushed aside . Now she spoke sharply .  You know I was not going to say anything of the kind . And I dont think you should speak in this horrible , cynical way of--of--  She stopped , flushing . There were moments when she hated Cynthia . These occurred for the most part when the latter , as now , stirred her to an exhibition of honest feeling which she looked on as rather unbecoming . Mrs Ford had spent twenty years trying to forget that her husband had married her from behind the counter of a general store in an Illinois village , and these lapses into the uncultivated genuineness of her girlhood made her uncomfortable .  I wasnt going to say anything of the kind , she repeated .  Cynthia was all smiling good-humour .  I know . I was only teasing you . Stringing , they call it in your country , dont they ?  Mrs Ford was mollified .  Im sorry , Cynthia . I didnt mean to snap at you . All the same  . . . She hesitated . What she wanted to ask smacked so dreadfully of Mechanicsville , Illinois . Yet she put the question bravely , for she was somehow feeling quite troubled about this unknown Mr Burns . Arent you really fond of him at all , Cynthia ?  Cynthia beamed .  Of course I am! Hes a dear . Nothing would make me give him up . Im devoted to old Peter . I only told you all that about him because it shows you how kind-hearted he is . Hell do anything for me . Well , shall I sound him about Ogden ?  The magic word took Mrs Fords mind off the matrimonial future of Mr Burns , and brought him into prominence in his capacity of knight-errant . She laughed happily . The contemplation of Mr Burns as knight-errant healed the sting of defeat . The affair of Mr Mennick began to appear in the light of a mere skirmish .  You take my breath away! she said . How do you propose that Mr Burns shall help us ?  Its perfectly simple . You heard Mr Mennick read that telegram . Ogden is to be sent to a private school . Peter shall go there too .  But how ? I dont understand . We dont know which school Mr Mennick will choose .  We can very soon find out .  But how can Mr Burns go there ?  Nothing easier . He will be a young man who has been left a little money and wants to start a school of his own . He goes to Ogdens man and suggests that he pay a small premium to come to him for a term as an extra-assistant-master , to learn the business . Mr Man will jump at him . He will be getting the bargain of his life . Peter didnt get much of a degree at Oxford , but I believe he was wonderful at games . From a private-school point of view hes a treasure .  But--would he do it ?  I think I can persuade him .  Mrs Ford kissed her with an enthusiasm which hitherto she had reserved for Ogden .  My darling girl , she cried , if you knew how happy you have made me!  I do , said Cynthia definitely . And now you can do the same for me .  Anything , anything! You must have some more hats .  I dont want any more hats . I want to go with you on Lord Mountrys yacht to the Riviera .  Of course , said Mrs Ford after a slight pause , it isnt my party , you know , dear .  No . But you can work me in , darling .  Its quite a small party . Very quiet .  Crowds bore me . I enjoy quiet .  Mrs Ford capitulated .  I fancy you are doing me a very good turn , she said . You must certainly come on the yacht .  Ill tell Peter to come straight round here now , said Cynthia simply . She went to the telephone .       Part Two   In which other interested parties , notably one Buck MacGinnis and a trade rival , Smooth Sam Fisher , make other plans for the Nuggets future . Of stirring times at a private school for young gentlemen . Of stratagems , spoils , and alarms by night . Of journeys ending in lovers meetings . The whole related by Mr Peter Burns , gentleman of leisure , who forfeits that leisure in a good cause .    Peter Burnss Narrative     Chapter 1   I  I am strongly of the opinion that , after the age of twenty-one , a man ought not to be out of bed and awake at four in the morning . The hour breeds thought . At twenty-one , life being all future , it may be examined with impunity . But , at thirty , having become an uncomfortable mixture of future and past , it is a thing to be looked at only when the sun is high and the world full of warmth and optimism .  This thought came to me as I returned to my rooms after the Fletchers ball . The dawn was breaking as I let myself in . The air was heavy with the peculiar desolation of a London winter morning . The houses looked dead and untenanted . A cart rumbled past , and across the grey street a dingy black cat , moving furtively along the pavement , gave an additional touch of forlornness to the scene .  I shivered . I was tired and hungry , and the reaction after the emotions of the night had left me dispirited .  I was engaged to be married . An hour back I had proposed to Cynthia Drassilis . And I can honestly say that it had come as a great surprise to me .  Why had I done it ? Did I love her ? It was so difficult to analyse love: and perhaps the mere fact that I was attempting the task was an answer to the question . Certainly I had never tried to do so five years ago when I had loved Audrey Blake . I had let myself be carried on from day to day in a sort of trance , content to be utterly happy , without dissecting my happiness . But I was five years younger then , and Audrey was--Audrey .  I must explain Audrey , for she in her turn explains Cynthia .  I have no illusions regarding my character when I first met Audrey Blake . Nature had given me the soul of a pig , and circumstances had conspired to carry on Natures work . I loved comfort , and I could afford to have it . From the moment I came of age and relieved my trustees of the care of my money , I wrapped myself in comfort as in a garment . I wallowed in egoism . In fact , if , between my twenty-first and my twenty-fifth birthdays , I had one unselfish thought , or did one genuinely unselfish action , my memory is a blank on the point .  It was at the height of this period that I became engaged to Audrey . Now that I can understand her better and see myself , impartially , as I was in those days , I can realize how indescribably offensive I must have been . My love was real , but that did not prevent its patronizing complacency being an insult . I was King Cophetua . If I did not actually say in so many words , This beggar-maid shall be my queen , I said it plainly and often in my manner . She was the daughter of a dissolute , evil-tempered artist whom I had met at a Bohemian club . He made a living by painting an occasional picture , illustrating an occasional magazine-story , but mainly by doing advertisement work . A proprietor of a patent Infants Food , not satisfied with the bare statement that Baby Cried For It , would feel it necessary to push the fact home to the public through the medium of Art , and Mr Blake would be commissioned to draw the picture . A good many specimens of his work in this vein were to be found in the back pages of the magazines .  A man may make a living by these means , but it is one that inclines him to jump at a wealthy son-in-law . Mr Blake jumped at me . It was one of his last acts on this earth . A week after he had--as I now suspect--bullied Audrey into accepting me , he died of pneumonia .  His death had several results . It postponed the wedding: it stirred me to a very crescendo of patronage , for with the removal of the bread-winner the only flaw in my Cophetua pose had vanished: and it gave Audrey a great deal more scope than she had hitherto been granted for the exercise of free will in the choice of a husband .  This last aspect of the matter was speedily brought to my notice , which till then it had escaped , by a letter from her , handed to me one night at the club , where I was sipping coffee and musing on the excellence of life in this best of all possible worlds .  It was brief and to the point . She had been married that morning .  To say that that moment was a turning point in my life would be to use a ridiculously inadequate phrase . It dynamited my life . In a sense it killed me . The man I had been died that night , regretted , I imagine , by few . Whatever I am today , I am certainly not the complacent spectator of life that I had been before that night .  I crushed the letter in my hand , and sat staring at it , my pigsty in ruins about my ears , face to face with the fact that , even in a best of all possible worlds , money will not buy everything .  I remember , as I sat there , a man , a club acquaintance , a bore from whom I had fled many a time , came and settled down beside me and began to talk . He was a small man , but he possessed a voice to which one had to listen . He talked and talked and talked . How I loathed him , as I sat trying to think through his stream of words . I see now that he saved me . He forced me out of myself . But at the time he oppressed me . I was raw and bleeding . I was struggling to grasp the incredible . I had taken Audreys unalterable affection for granted . She was the natural complement to my scheme of comfort . I wanted her; I had chosen and was satisfied with her , therefore all was well . And now I had to adjust my mind to the impossible fact that I had lost her .  Her letter was a mirror in which I saw myself . She said little , but I understood , and my self-satisfaction was in ribbons--and something deeper than self-satisfaction . I saw now that I loved her as I had not dreamed myself capable of loving .  And all the while this man talked and talked .  I have a theory that speech , persevered in , is more efficacious in times of trouble than silent sympathy . Up to a certain point it maddens almost beyond endurance; but , that point past , it soothes . At least , it was so in my case . Gradually I found myself hating him less . Soon I began to listen , then to answer . Before I left the club that night , the first mad frenzy , in which I could have been capable of anything , had gone from me , and I walked home , feeling curiously weak and helpless , but calm , to begin the new life .  Three years passed before I met Cynthia . I spent those years wandering in many countries . At last , as one is apt to do , I drifted back to London , and settled down again to a life which , superficially , was much the same as the one I had led in the days before I knew Audrey . My old circle in London had been wide , and I found it easy to pick up dropped threads . I made new friends , among them Cynthia Drassilis .  I liked Cynthia , and I was sorry for her . I think that , about that time I met her , I was sorry for most people . The shock of Audreys departure had had that effect upon me . It is always the bad nigger who gets religion most strongly at the camp-meeting , and in my case getting religion had taken the form of suppression of self . I never have been able to do things by halves , or even with a decent moderation . As an egoist I had been thorough in my egoism; and now , fate having bludgeoned that vice out of me , I found myself possessed of an almost morbid sympathy with the troubles of other people .  I was extremely sorry for Cynthia Drassilis . Meeting her mother frequently , I could hardly fail to be . Mrs Drassilis was a representative of a type I disliked . She was a widow , who had been left with what she considered insufficient means , and her outlook on life was a compound of greed and querulousness . Sloane Square and South Kensington are full of women in her situation . Their position resembles that of the Ancient Mariner . Water , water everywhere , and not a drop to drink . For water in their case substitute money . Mrs Drassilis was connected with money on all sides , but could only obtain it in rare and minute quantities . Any one of a dozen relations-in-law could , if they had wished , have trebled her annual income without feeling it . But they did not so wish . They disapproved of Mrs Drassilis . In their opinion the Hon . Hugo Drassilis had married beneath him--not so far beneath him as to make the thing a horror to be avoided in conversation and thought , but far enough to render them coldly polite to his wife during his lifetime and almost icy to his widow after his death . Hugos eldest brother , the Earl of Westbourne , had never liked the obviously beautiful , but equally obviously second-rate , daughter of a provincial solicitor whom Hugo had suddenly presented to the family one memorable summer as his bride . He considered that , by doubling the income derived from Hugos life-insurance and inviting Cynthia to the family seat once a year during her childhood , he had done all that could be expected of him in the matter .  He had not . Mrs Drassilis expected a great deal more of him , the non-receipt of which had spoiled her temper , her looks , and the peace of mind of all who had anything much to do with her .  It used to irritate me when I overheard people , as I occasionally have done , speak of Cynthia as hard . I never found her so myself , though heaven knows she had enough to make her so , to me she was always a sympathetic , charming friend .  Ours was a friendship almost untouched by sex . Our minds fitted so smoothly into one another that I had no inclination to fall in love . I knew her too well . I had no discoveries to make about her . Her honest , simple soul had always been open to me to read . There was none of that curiosity , that sense of something beyond that makes for love . We had reached a point of comradeship beyond which neither of us desired to pass .  Yet at the Fletchers ball I asked Cynthia to marry me , and she consented .         *       *       *       *       *  Looking back , I can see that , though the determining cause was Mr Tankerville Gifford , it was Audrey who was responsible . She had made me human , capable of sympathy , and it was sympathy , primarily , that led me to say what I said that night .  But the immediate cause was certainly young Mr Gifford .  I arrived at Marlow Square , where I was to pick up Cynthia and her mother , a little late , and found Mrs Drassilis , florid and overdressed , in the drawing-room with a sleek-haired , pale young man known to me as Tankerville Gifford--to his intimates , of whom I was not one , and in the personal paragraphs of the coloured sporting weeklies , as Tanky . I had seen him frequently at restaurants . Once , at the Empire , somebody had introduced me to him; but , as he had not been sober at the moment , he had missed any intellectual pleasure my acquaintanceship might have afforded him . Like everybody else who moves about in London , I knew all about him . To sum him up , he was a most unspeakable little cad , and , if the drawing-room had not been Mrs Drassiliss , I should have wondered at finding him in it .  Mrs Drassilis introduced us .  I think we have already met , I said .  He stared glassily .  Dont remember .  I was not surprised .  At this moment Cynthia came in . Out of the corner of my eye I observed a look of fuddled displeasure come into Tankys face at her frank pleasure at seeing me .  I had never seen her looking better . She is a tall girl , who carries herself magnificently . The simplicity of her dress gained an added dignity from comparison with the rank glitter of her mothers . She wore unrelieved black , a colour which set off to wonderful advantage the clear white of her skin and her pale-gold hair .  Youre late , Peter , she said , looking at the clock .  I know . Im sorry .  Better be pushing , what ? suggested Tanky .  My cabs waiting .  Will you ring the bell , Mr Gifford ? said Mrs Drassilis . I will tell Parker to whistle for another .  Take me in yours , I heard a voice whisper in my ear .  I looked at Cynthia . Her expression had not changed . Then I looked at Tanky Gifford , and I understood . I had seen that stuffed-fish look on his face before--on the occasion when I had been introduced to him at the Empire .  If you and Mr Gifford will take my cab , I said to Mrs Drassilis , we will follow .  Mrs Drassilis blocked the motion . I imagine that the sharp note in her voice was lost on Tanky , but it rang out like a clarion to me .  I am in no hurry , she said . Mr Gifford , will you take Cynthia ? I will follow with Mr Burns . You will meet Parker on the stairs . Tell him to call another cab .  As the door closed behind them , she turned on me like a many-coloured snake .  How can you be so extraordinarily tactless , Peter ? she cried . Youre a perfect fool . Have you no eyes ?  Im sorry , I said .  Hes devoted to her .  Im sorry .  What do you mean ?  Sorry for her .  She seemed to draw herself together inside her dress . Her eyes glittered . My mouth felt very dry , and my heart was beginning to thump . We were both furiously angry . It was a moment that had been coming for years , and we both knew it . For my part I was glad that it had come . On subjects on which one feels deeply it is a relief to speak ones mind .  Oh! she said at last . Her voice quivered . She was clutching at her self-control as it slipped from her . Oh! And what is my daughter to you , Mr Burns!  A great friend .  And I suppose you think it friendly to try to spoil her chances ?  If Mr Gifford is a sample of them--yes .  What do you mean ?  She choked .  I see . I understand . I am going to put a stop to this once and for all . Do you hear ? I have noticed it for a long time . Because I have given you the run of the house , and allowed you to come in and out as you pleased , like a tame cat , you presume--  Presume-- I prompted .  You come here and stand in Cynthias way . You trade on the fact that you have known us all this time to monopolize her attention . You spoil her chances . You--  The invaluable Parker entered to say that the cab was at the door .  We drove to the Fletchers house in silence . The spell had been broken . Neither of us could recapture that first , fine , careless rapture which had carried us through the opening stages of the conflict , and discussion of the subject on a less exalted plane was impossible . It was that blessed period of calm , the rest between rounds , and we observed it to the full .  When I reached the ballroom a waltz was just finishing . Cynthia , a statue in black , was dancing with Tanky Gifford . They were opposite me when the music stopped , and she caught sight of me over his shoulder .  She disengaged herself and moved quickly towards me .  Take me away , she said under her breath . Anywhere . Quick .  It was no time to consider the etiquette of the ballroom . Tanky , startled at his sudden loneliness , seemed by his expression to be endeavouring to bring his mind to bear on the matter . A couple making for the door cut us off from him , and following them , we passed out .  Neither of us spoke till we had reached the little room where I had meditated .  She sat down . She was looking pale and tired .  Oh , dear! she said .  I understood . I seemed to see that journey in the cab , those dances , those terrible between-dances  . . .  It was very sudden .  I took her hand . She turned to me with a tired smile . There were tears in her eyes  . . .  I heard myself speaking  . . .  She was looking at me , her eyes shining . All the weariness seemed to have gone out of them .  I looked at her .  There was something missing . I had felt it when I was speaking . To me my voice had had no ring of conviction . And then I saw what it was . There was no mystery . We knew each other too well . Friendship kills love .  She put my thought into words .  We have always been brother and sister , she said doubtfully .  Till tonight .  You have changed tonight ? You really want me ?  Did I ? I tried to put the question to myself and answer it honestly . Yes , in a sense , I had changed tonight . There was an added appreciation of her fineness , a quickening of that blend of admiration and pity which I had always felt for her . I wanted with all my heart to help her , to take her away from her dreadful surroundings , to make her happy . But did I want her in the sense in which she had used the word ? Did I want her as I had wanted Audrey Blake ? I winced away from the question . Audrey belonged to the dead past , but it hurt to think of her .  Was it merely because I was five years older now than when I had wanted Audrey that the fire had gone out of me ?  I shut my mind against my doubts .  I have changed tonight , I said .  And I bent down and kissed her .  I was conscious of being defiant against somebody . And then I knew that the somebody was myself .  I poured myself out a cup of hot coffee from the flask which Smith , my man , had filled against my return . It put life into me . The oppression lifted .  And yet there remained something that made for uneasiness , a sort of foreboding at the back of my mind .  I had taken a step in the dark , and I was afraid for Cynthia . I had undertaken to give her happiness . Was I certain that I could succeed ? The glow of chivalry had left me , and I began to doubt .  Audrey had taken from me something that I could not recover--poetry was as near as I could get to a definition of it . Yes , poetry . With Cynthia my feet would always be on the solid earth . To the end of the chapter we should be friends and nothing more .  I found myself pitying Cynthia intensely . I saw her future a series of years of intolerable dullness . She was too good to be tied for life to a battered hulk like myself .  I drank more coffee and my mood changed . Even in the grey of a winter morning a man of thirty , in excellent health , cannot pose to himself for long as a piece of human junk , especially if he comforts himself with hot coffee .  My mind resumed its balance . I laughed at myself as a sentimental fraud . Of course I could make her happy . No man and woman had ever been more admirably suited to each other . As for that first disaster , which I had been magnifying into a life-tragedy , what of it ? An incident of my boyhood . A ridiculous episode which--I rose with the intention of doing so at once--I should now proceed to eliminate from my life .  I went quickly to my desk , unlocked it , and took out a photograph .  And then--undoubtedly four oclock in the morning is no time for a man to try to be single-minded and decisive--I wavered . I had intended to tear the thing in pieces without a glance , and fling it into the wastepaper-basket . But I took the glance and I hesitated .  The girl in the photograph was small and slight , and she looked straight out of the picture with large eyes that met and challenged mine . How well I remembered them , those Irish-blue eyes under their expressive , rather heavy brows . How exactly the photographer had caught that half-wistful , half-impudent look , the chin tilted , the mouth curving into a smile .  In a wave all my doubts had surged back upon me . Was this mere sentimentalism , a four-in-the-morning tribute to the pathos of the flying years , or did she really fill my soul and stand guard over it so that no successor could enter in and usurp her place ?  I had no answer , unless the fact that I replaced the photograph in its drawer was one . I felt that this thing could not be decided now . It was more difficult than I had thought .  All my gloom had returned by the time I was in bed . Hours seemed to pass while I tossed restlessly aching for sleep .  When I woke my last coherent thought was still clear in my mind . It was a passionate vow that , come what might , if those Irish eyes were to haunt me till my death , I would play the game loyally with Cynthia .   II  The telephone bell rang just as I was getting ready to call at Marlow Square and inform Mrs Drassilis of the position of affairs . Cynthia , I imagined , would have broken the news already , which would mitigate the embarrassment of the interview to some extent; but the recollection of my last nights encounter with Mrs Drassilis prevented me from looking forward with any joy to the prospect of meeting her again .  Cynthias voice greeted me as I unhooked the receiver .  Hullo , Peter! Is that you ? I want you to come round here at once .  I was just starting , I said .  I dont mean Marlow Square . Im not there . Im at the Guelph . Ask for Mrs Fords suite . Its very important . Ill tell you all about it when you get here . Come as soon as you can .  My rooms were conveniently situated for visits to the Hotel Guelph . A walk of a couple of minutes took me there . Mrs Fords suite was on the third floor . I rang the bell and Cynthia opened the door to me .  Come in , she said . Youre a dear to be so quick .  My rooms are only just round the corner . She shut the door , and for the first time we looked at one another . I could not say that I was nervous , but there was certainly , to me , a something strange in the atmosphere . Last night seemed a long way off and somehow a little unreal . I suppose I must have shown this in my manner , for she suddenly broke what had amounted to a distinct pause by giving a little laugh . Peter , she said , youre embarrassed . I denied the charge warmly , but without real conviction . I was embarrassed . Then you ought to be , she said . Last night , when I was looking my very best in a lovely dress , you asked me to marry you . Now you see me again in cold blood , and youre wondering how you can back out of it without hurting my feelings .  I smiled . She did not . I ceased to smile . She was looking at me in a very peculiar manner .  Peter , she said , are you sure ?  My dear old Cynthia , I said , whats the matter with you ?  You are sure ? she persisted .  Absolutely , entirely sure . I had a vision of two large eyes looking at me out of a photograph . It came and went in a flash .  I kissed Cynthia .  What quantities of hair you have , I said . Its a shame to cover it up . She was not responsive . Youre in a very queer mood today , Cynthia , I went on . Whats the matter ?  Ive been thinking .  Out with it . Something has gone wrong . An idea flashed upon me . Er--has your mother--is your mother very angry about--  Mothers delighted . She always liked you , Peter .  I had the self-restraint to check a grin .  Then what is it ? I said . Tired after the dance ?  Nothing as simple as that .  Tell me .  Its so difficult to put it into words .  Try .  She was playing with the papers on the table , her face turned away . For a moment she did not speak .  Ive been worrying myself , Peter , she said at last . You are so chivalrous and unselfish . Youre quixotic . Its that that is troubling me . Are you marrying me just because youre sorry for me ? Dont speak . I can tell you now if you will just let me say straight out whats in my mind . We have known each other for two years now . You know all about me . You know how--how unhappy I am at home . Are you marrying me just because you pity me and want to take me out of all that ?  My dear girl!  You havent answered my question .  I answered it two minutes ago when you asked me if--  You do love me ?  Yes .  All this time she had been keeping her face averted , but now she turned and looked into my eyes with an abrupt intensity which , I confess , startled me . Her words startled me more .  Peter , do you love me as much as you loved Audrey Blake ?  In the instant which divided her words from my reply my mind flew hither and thither , trying to recall an occasion when I could have mentioned Audrey to her . I was convinced that I had not done so . I never mentioned Audrey to anyone .  There is a grain of superstition in the most level-headed man . I am not particularly level-headed , and I have more than a grain in me . I was shaken . Ever since I had asked Cynthia to marry me , it seemed as if the ghost of Audrey had come back into my life .  Good Lord! I cried . What do you know of Audrey Blake ?  She turned her face away again .  Her name seems to affect you very strongly , she said quietly .  I recovered myself .  If you ask an old soldier , I said , he will tell you that a wound , long after it has healed , is apt to give you an occasional twinge .  Not if it has really healed .  Yes , when it has really healed--when you can hardly remember how you were fool enough to get it .  She said nothing .  How did you hear about--it ? I asked .  When I first met you , or soon after , a friend of yours--we happened to be talking about you--told me that you had been engaged to be married to a girl named Audrey Blake . He was to have been your best man , he said , but one day you wrote and told him there would be no wedding , and then you disappeared; and nobody saw you again for three years .  Yes , I said: that is all quite true .  It seems to have been a serious affair , Peter . I mean--the sort of thing a man would find it hard to forget .  I tried to smile , but I knew that I was not doing it well . It was hurting me extraordinarily , this discussion of Audrey .  A man would find it almost impossible , I said , unless he had a remarkably poor memory .  I didnt mean that . You know what I mean by forget .  Yes , I said , I do .  She came quickly to me and took me by the shoulders , looking into my face .  Peter , can you honestly say you have forgotten her--in the sense I mean ?  Yes , I said .  Again that feeling swept over me--that curious sensation of being defiant against myself .  She does not stand between us ?  No , I said .  I could feel the effort behind the word . It was as if some subconscious part of me were working to keep it back .  Peter!  There was a soft smile on her face; as she raised it to mine I put my arms around her .  She drew away with a little laugh . Her whole manner had changed . She was a different being from the girl who had looked so gravely into my eyes a moment before .  Oh , my dear boy , how terribly muscular you are! Youve crushed me . I expect you used to be splendid at football , like Mr Broster .  I did not reply at once . I cannot wrap up the deeper emotions and put them back on their shelf directly I have no further immediate use for them . I slowly adjusted myself to the new key of the conversation .  Whos Broster ? I asked at length .  He used to be tutor to--she turned me round and pointed--to that .  I had seen a picture standing on one of the chairs when I entered the room but had taken no particular notice of it . I now gave it a closer glance . It was a portrait , very crudely done , of a singularly repulsive child of about ten or eleven years old .  Was he , poor chap! Well , we all have our troubles , dont we! Who is this young thug! Not a friend of yours , I hope ?  That is Ogden , Mrs Fords son . Its a tragedy--  Perhaps it doesnt do him justice . Does he really squint like that , or is it just the artists imagination ?  Dont make fun of it . Its the loss of that boy that is breaking Nestas heart .  I was shocked .  Is he dead ? Im awfully sorry . I wouldnt for the world--  No , no . He is alive and well . But he is dead to her . The court gave him into the custody of his father .  The court ?  Mrs Ford was the wife of Elmer Ford , the American millionaire . They were divorced a year ago .  I see .  Cynthia was gazing at the portrait .  This boy is quite a celebrity in his way , she said . They call him The Little Nugget in America .  Oh! Why is that ?  Its a nickname the kidnappers have for him . Ever so many attempts have been made to steal him .  She stopped and looked at me oddly .  I made one today , Peter , she said . I went down to the country , where the boy was , and kidnapped him .  Cynthia! What on earth do you mean ?  Dont you understand ? I did it for Nestas sake . She was breaking her heart about not being able to see him , so I slipped down and stole him away , and brought him back here .  I do not know if I was looking as amazed as I felt . I hope not , for I felt as if my brain were giving way . The perfect calmness with which she spoke of this extraordinary freak added to my confusion .  Youre joking!  No; I stole him .  But , good heavens! The law! Its a penal offence , you know!  Well , I did it . Men like Elmer Ford arent fit to have charge of a child . You dont know him , but hes just an unscrupulous financier , without a thought above money . To think of a boy growing up in that tainted atmosphere--at his most impressionable age . It means death to any good there is in him .  My mind was still grappling feebly with the legal aspect of the affair .  But , Cynthia , kidnappings kidnapping , you know! The law doesnt take any notice of motives . If youre caught--  She cut through my babble .  Would you have been afraid to do it , Peter ?  Well-- I began . I had not considered the point before .  I dont believe you would . If I asked you to do it for my sake--  But , Cynthia , kidnapping , you know! Its such an infernally low-down game .  I played it . Do you despise me ?  I perspired . I could think of no other reply .  Peter , she said , I understand your scruples . I know exactly how you feel . But cant you see that this is quite different from the sort of kidnapping you naturally look on as horrible ? Its just taking a boy away from surroundings that must harm him , back to his mother , who worships him . Its not wrong . Its splendid .  She paused .  You will do it for me , Peter ? she said .  I dont understand , I said feebly . Its done . Youve kidnapped him yourself .  They tracked him and took him back . And now I want you to try . She came closer to me . Peter , dont you see what it will mean to me if you agree to try ? Im only human , I cant help , at the bottom of my heart , still being a little jealous of this Audrey Blake . No , dont say anything . Words cant cure me; but if you do this thing for me , I shall be satisfied . I shall know .  She was close beside me , holding my arm and looking into my face . That sense of the unreality of things which had haunted me since that moment at the dance came over me with renewed intensity . Life had ceased to be a rather grey , orderly business in which day succeeded day calmly and without event . Its steady stream had broken up into rapids , and I was being whirled away on them .  Will you do it , Peter ? Say you will .  A voice , presumably mine , answered Yes .  My dear old boy!  She pushed me into a chair , and , sitting on the arm of it , laid her hand on mine and became of a sudden wondrously business-like .  Listen , she said , Ill tell you what we have arranged .  It was borne in upon me , as she began to do so , that she appeared from the very beginning to have been extremely confident that that essential part of her plans , my consent to the scheme , could be relied upon as something of a certainty . Women have these intuitions .   III  Looking back , I think I can fix the point at which this insane venture I had undertaken ceased to be a distorted dream , from which I vaguely hoped that I might shortly waken , and took shape as a reality of the immediate future . That moment came when I met Mr Arnold Abney by appointment at his club .  Till then the whole enterprise had been visionary . I gathered from Cynthia that the boy Ogden was shortly to be sent to a preparatory school , and that I was to insinuate myself into this school and , watching my opportunity , to remove him; but it seemed to me that the obstacles to this comparatively lucid scheme were insuperable . In the first place , how were we to discover which of Englands million preparatory schools Mr Ford , or Mr Mennick for him , would choose ? Secondly , the plot which was to carry me triumphantly into this school when--or if--found , struck me as extremely thin . I was to pose , Cynthia told me , as a young man of private means , anxious to learn the business , with a view to setting up a school of his own . The objection to that was , I held , that I obviously did not want to do anything of the sort . I had not the appearance of a man with such an ambition . I had none of the conversation of such a man .  I put it to Cynthia .  They would find me out in a day , I assured her . A man who wants to set up a school has got to be a pretty brainy sort of fellow . I dont know anything .  You got your degree .  A degree . At any rate , Ive forgotten all I knew .  That doesnt matter . You have the money . Anybody with money can start a school , even if he doesnt know a thing . Nobody would think it strange .  It struck me as a monstrous slur on our educational system , but reflection told me it was true . The proprietor of a preparatory school , if he is a man of wealth , need not be able to teach , any more than an impresario need be able to write plays .  Well , well pass that for the moment , I said . Heres the real difficulty . How are you going to find out the school Mr Ford has chosen ?  I have found it out already--or Nesta has . She set a detective to work . It was perfectly easy . Ogdens going to Mr Abneys . Sanstead House is the name of the place . Its in Hampshire somewhere . Quite a small school , but full of little dukes and earls and things . Lord Mountrys younger brother , Augustus Beckford , is there .  I had known Lord Mountry and his family well some years ago . I remembered Augustus dimly .  Mountry ? Do you know him ? He was up at Oxford with me .  She seemed interested .  What kind of a man is he ? she asked .  Oh , quite a good sort . Rather an ass . I havent seen him for years .  Hes a friend of Nestas . Ive only met him once . He is going to be your reference .  My what ?  You will need a reference . At least , I suppose you will . And , anyhow , if you say you know Lord Mountry it will make it simpler for you with Mr Abney , the brother being at the school .  Does Mountry know about this business ? Have you told him why I want to go to Abneys ?  Nesta told him . He thought it was very sporting of you . He will tell Mr Abney anything we like . By the way , Peter , you will have to pay a premium or something , I suppose . But Nesta will look after all expenses , of course .  On this point I made my only stand of the afternoon .  No , I said; its very kind of her , but this is going to be entirely an amateur performance . Im doing this for you , and Ill stand the racket . Good heavens! Fancy taking money for a job of this kind!  She looked at me rather oddly .  That is very sweet of you , Peter , she said , after a slight pause . Now lets get to work .  And together we composed the letter which led to my sitting , two days later , in stately conference at his club with Mr Arnold Abney , M .A . , of Sanstead House , Hampshire .  Mr Abney proved to be a long , suave , benevolent man with an Oxford manner , a high forehead , thin white hands , a cooing intonation , and a general air of hushed importance , as of one in constant communication with the Great . There was in his bearing something of the family solicitor in whom dukes confide , and something of the private chaplain at the Castle .  He gave me the key-note to his character in the first minute of our acquaintanceship . We had seated ourselves at a table in the smoking-room when an elderly gentleman shuffled past , giving a nod in transit . My companion sprang to his feet almost convulsively , returned the salutation , and subsided slowly into his chair again .  The Duke of Devizes , he said in an undertone . A most able man . Most able . His nephew , Lord Ronald Stokeshaye , was one of my pupils . A charming boy .  I gathered that the old feudal spirit still glowed to some extent in Mr Abneys bosom .  We came to business .  So you wish to be one of us , Mr Burns , to enter the scholastic profession ?  I tried to look as if I did .  Well , in certain circumstances , the circumstances in which I--ah--myself , I may say , am situated , there is no more delightful occupation . The work is interesting . There is the constant fascination of seeing these fresh young lives develop--and of helping them to develop--under ones eyes; in any case , I may say , there is the exceptional interest of being in a position to mould the growing minds of lads who will some day take their place among the countrys hereditary legislators , that little knot of devoted men who , despite the vulgar attacks of loudmouthed demagogues , still do their share , and more , in the guidance of Englands fortunes . Yes .  He paused . I said I thought so , too .  You are an Oxford man , Mr Burns , I think you told me ? Ah , I have your letter here . Just so . You were at--ah , yes . A fine college . The Dean is a lifelong friend of mine . Perhaps you knew my late pupil , Lord Rollo ?--no , he would have been since your time . A delightful boy . Quite delightful  . . . And you took your degree ? Exactly . And represented the university at both cricket and Rugby football ? Excellent . Mens sana in--ah--corpore , in fact , sano , yes!  He folded the letter carefully and replaced it in his pocket .  Your primary object in coming to me , Mr Burns , is , I gather , to learn the--ah--the ropes , the business ? You have had little or no previous experience of school-mastering ?  None whatever .  Then your best plan would undoubtedly be to consider yourself and work for a time simply as an ordinary assistant-master . You would thus get a sound knowledge of the intricacies of the profession which would stand you in good stead when you decide to set up your own school . School-mastering is a profession , which cannot be taught adequately except in practice . Only those who--ah--brave its dangers comprehend its mystery . Yes , I would certainly recommend you to begin at the foot of the ladder and go , at least for a time , through the mill .  Certainly , I said . Of course .  My ready acquiescence pleased him . I could see that he was relieved . I think he had expected me to jib at the prospect of actual work .  As it happens , he said , my classical master left me at the end of last term . I was about to go to the Agency for a successor when your letter arrived . Would you consider--  I had to think this over . Feeling kindly disposed towards Mr Arnold Abney , I wished to do him as little harm as possible . I was going to rob him of a boy , who , while no moulding of his growing mind could make him into a hereditary legislator , did undoubtedly represent a portion of Mr Abneys annual income; and I did not want to increase my offence by being a useless assistant-master . Then I reflected that , if I was no Jowett , at least I knew enough Latin and Greek to teach the rudiments of those languages to small boys . My conscience was satisfied .  I should be delighted , I said .  Excellent . Then let us consider that as--ah--settled , said Mr Abney .  There was a pause . My companion began to fiddle a little uncomfortably with an ash-tray . I wondered what was the matter , and then it came to me . We were about to become sordid . The discussion of terms was upon us .  And as I realized this , I saw simultaneously how I could throw one more sop to my exigent conscience . After all , the whole thing was really a question of hard cash . By kidnapping Ogden I should be taking money from Mr Abney . By paying my premium I should be giving it back to him .  I considered the circumstances . Ogden was now about thirteen years old . The preparatory-school age limit may be estimated roughly at fourteen . That is to say , in any event Sanstead House could only harbour him for one year . Mr Abneys fees I had to guess at . To be on the safe side , I fixed my premium at an outside figure , and , getting to the point at once , I named it .  It was entirely satisfactory . My mental arithmetic had done me credit . Mr Abney beamed upon me . Over tea and muffins we became very friendly . In half an hour I heard more of the theory of school-mastering than I had dreamed existed .  We said good-bye at the club front door . He smiled down at me benevolently from the top of the steps .  Good-bye , Mr Burns , good-bye , he said . We shall meet at--ah--Philippi .  When I reached my rooms , I rang for Smith .  Smith , I said , I want you to get some books for me first thing tomorrow . You had better take a note of them .  He moistened his pencil .  A Latin Grammar .  Yes , sir .  A Greek Grammar .  Yes , sir .  Brodley Arnolds Easy Prose Sentences .  Yes , sir .  And Caesars Gallic Wars .  What name , sir ?  Caesar .  Thank you , sir . Anything else , sir ?  No , that will be all .  Very good , sir .  He shimmered from the room .  Thank goodness , Smith always has thought me mad , and is consequently never surprised at anything I ask him to do .     Chapter 2   Sanstead House was an imposing building in the Georgian style . It stood , foursquare , in the midst of about nine acres of land . For the greater part of its existence , I learned later , it had been the private home of a family of the name of Boone , and in its early days the estate had been considerable . But the progress of the years had brought changes to the Boones . Money losses had necessitated the sale of land . New roads had come into being , cutting off portions of the estate from their centre . New facilities for travel had drawn members of the family away from home . The old fixed life of the country had changed , and in the end the latest Boone had come to the conclusion that to keep up so large and expensive a house was not worth his while .  That the place should have become a school was the natural process of evolution . It was too large for the ordinary purchaser , and the estate had been so whittled down in the course of time that it was inadequate for the wealthy . Colonel Boone had been glad to let it to Mr Abney , and the school had started its career .  It had all the necessary qualifications for a school . It was isolated . The village was two miles from its gates . It was near the sea . There were fields for cricket and football , and inside the house a number of rooms of every size , suitable for classrooms and dormitories .  The household , when I arrived , consisted , besides Mr Abney , myself , another master named Glossop , and the matron , of twenty-four boys , the butler , the cook , the odd-job-man , two housemaids , a scullery-maid , and a parlour-maid . It was a little colony , cut off from the outer world .  With the exception of Mr Abney and Glossop , a dismal man of nerves and mannerisms , the only person with whom I exchanged speech on my first evening was White , the butler . There are some men one likes at sight . White was one of them . Even for a butler he was a man of remarkably smooth manners , but he lacked that quality of austere aloofness which I have noticed in other butlers .  He helped me unpack my box , and we chatted during the process . He was a man of medium height , square and muscular , with something , some quality of springiness , as it were , that seemed unusual in a butler . From one or two things he said , I gathered that he had travelled a good deal . Altogether he interested me . He had humour , and the half-hour which I had spent with Glossop made me set a premium on humour . I found that he , like myself , was a new-comer . His predecessor had left at short notice during the holidays , and he had secured the vacancy at about the same time that I was securing mine . We agreed that it was a pretty place . White , I gathered , regarded its isolation as a merit . He was not fond of village society .  On the following morning , at eight oclock , my work began .  My first day had the effect of entirely revolutionizing what ideas I possessed of the lot of the private-school assistant-master .  My view , till then , had been that the assistant-master had an easy time . I had only studied him from the outside . My opinion was based on observations made as a boy at my own private school , when masters were an enviable race who went to bed when they liked , had no preparation to do , and couldnt be caned . It seemed to me then that those three facts , especially the last , formed a pretty good basis on which to build up the Perfect Life .  I had not been at Sanstead House two days before doubts began to creep in on this point . What the boy , observing the assistant-master standing about in apparently magnificent idleness , does not realize is that the unfortunate is really putting in a spell of exceedingly hard work . He is taking duty . And taking duty is a thing to be remembered , especially by a man who , like myself , has lived a life of fatted ease , protected from all the minor annoyances of life by a substantial income .  Sanstead House educated me . It startled me . It showed me a hundred ways in which I had allowed myself to become soft and inefficient , without being aware of it . There may be other professions which call for a fiercer display of energy , but for the man with a private income who has loitered through life at his own pace , a little school-mastering is brisk enough to be a wonderful tonic .  I needed it , and I got it .  It was almost as if Mr Abney had realized intuitively how excellent the discipline of work was for my soul , for the kindly man allowed me to do not only my own , but most of his as well . I have talked with assistant-masters since , and I have gathered from them that headmasters of private schools are divided into two classes: the workers and the runners-up-to-London . Mr Abney belonged to the latter class . Indeed , I doubt if a finer representative of the class could have been found in the length and breadth of southern England . London drew him like a magnet .  After breakfast he would take me aside . The formula was always the same .  Ah--Mr Burns .  Myself (apprehensively , scenting disaster , like some wild creature caught within a trap , who sees the trapper coming through the wood) . Yes ? Er--yes ?  I am afraid I shall be obliged to run up to London today . I have received an important letter from-- And then he would name some parent or some prospective parent . (By prospective I mean one who was thinking of sending his son to Sanstead House . You may have twenty children , but unless you send them to his school , a schoolmaster will refuse to dignify you with the name of parent .)  Then , He wishes--ah--to see me , or , in the case of titled parents , He wishes--ah--to talk things over with me . The distinction is subtle , but he always made it .  And presently the cab would roll away down the long drive , and my work would begin , and with it that soul-discipline to which I have alluded .  Taking duty makes certain definite calls upon a man . He has to answer questions; break up fights; stop big boys bullying small boys; prevent small boys bullying smaller boys; check stone-throwing , going-on-the-wet-grass , worrying-the-cook , teasing-the-dog , making-too-much-noise , and , in particular , discourage all forms of hara-kiri such as tree-climbing , water-spout-scaling , leaning-too-far-out-of-the-window , sliding-down-the-banisters , pencil-swallowing , and ink-drinking-because-somebody-dared-me-to .  At intervals throughout the day there are further feats to perform . Carving the joint , helping the pudding , playing football , reading prayers , teaching , herding stragglers in for meals , and going round the dormitories to see that the lights are out , are a few of them .  I wanted to oblige Cynthia , if I could , but there were moments during the first day or so when I wondered how on earth I was going to snatch the necessary time to combine kidnapping with my other duties . Of all the learned professions it seemed to me that that of the kidnapper most urgently demanded certain intervals for leisured thought , in which schemes and plots might be matured .  Schools vary . Sanstead House belonged to the more difficult class . Mr Abneys constant flittings did much to add to the burdens of his assistants , and his peculiar reverence for the aristocracy did even more . His endeavour to make Sanstead House a place where the delicately nurtured scions of the governing class might feel as little as possible the temporary loss of titled mothers led him into a benevolent tolerance which would have unsettled angels .  Success or failure for an assistant-master is , I consider , very much a matter of luck . My colleague , Glossop , had most of the qualities that make for success , but no luck . Properly backed up by Mr Abney , he might have kept order . As it was , his class-room was a bear-garden , and , when he took duty , chaos reigned .  I , on the other hand , had luck . For some reason the boys agreed to accept me . Quite early in my sojourn I enjoyed that sweetest triumph of the assistant-masters life , the spectacle of one boy smacking another boys head because the latter persisted in making a noise after I had told him to stop . I doubt if a man can experience so keenly in any other way that thrill which comes from the knowledge that the populace is his friend . Political orators must have the same sort of feeling when their audience clamours for the ejection of a heckler , but it cannot be so keen . One is so helpless with boys , unless they decide that they like one .  It was a week from the beginning of the term before I made the acquaintance of the Little Nugget .  I had kept my eyes open for him from the beginning , and when I discovered that he was not at school , I had felt alarmed . Had Cynthia sent me down here , to work as I had never worked before , on a wild-goose chase ?  Then , one morning , Mr Abney drew me aside after breakfast .  Ah--Mr Burns .  It was the first time that I had heard those soon-to-be-familiar words .  I fear I shall be compelled to run up to London today . I have an important appointment with the father of a boy who is coming to the school . He wishes--ah--to see me .  This might be the Little Nugget at last .  I was right . During the interval before school , Augustus Beckford approached me . Lord Mountrys brother was a stolid boy with freckles . He had two claims to popular fame . He could hold his breath longer than any other boy in the school , and he always got hold of any piece of gossip first .  Theres a new kid coming tonight , sir , he said--an American kid . I heard him talking about it to the matron . The kids names Ford , I believe the kids fathers awfully rich . Would you like to be rich , sir ? I wish I was rich . If I was rich , Id buy all sorts of things . I believe Im going to be rich when I grow up . I heard father talking to a lawyer about it . Theres a new parlour-maid coming soon , sir . I heard cook telling Emily . Im blowed if Id like to be a parlour-maid , would you , sir ? Id much rather be a cook .  He pondered the point for a moment . When he spoke again , it was to touch on a still more profound problem .  If you wanted a halfpenny to make up twopence to buy a lizard , what would you do , sir ?  He got it .  Ogden Ford , the El Dorado of the kidnapping industry , entered Sanstead House at a quarter past nine that evening . He was preceded by a Worried Look , Mr Arnold Abney , a cabman bearing a large box , and the odd-job man carrying two suitcases . I have given precedence to the Worried Look because it was a thing by itself . To say that Mr Abney wore it would be to create a wrong impression . Mr Abney simply followed in its wake . He was concealed behind it much as Macbeths army was concealed behind the woods of Dunsinane .  I only caught a glimpse of Ogden as Mr Abney showed him into his study . He seemed a self-possessed boy , very like but , if anything , uglier than the portrait of him which I had seen at the Hotel Guelph .  A moment later the door opened , and my employer came out . He appeared relieved at seeing me .  Ah , Mr Burns , I was about to go in search of you . Can you spare me a moment ? Let us go into the dining-room .  That is a boy called Ford , Mr Burns , he said , when he had closed the door . A rather--er--remarkable boy . He is an American , the son of a Mr Elmer Ford . As he will be to a great extent in your charge , I should like to prepare you for his--ah--peculiarities .  Is he peculiar ?  A faint spasm disturbed Mr Abneys face . He applied a silk handkerchief to his forehead before he replied .  In many ways , judged by the standard of the lads who have passed through my hands--boys , of course , who , it is only fair to add , have enjoyed the advantages of a singularly refined home-life--he may be said to be--ah--somewhat peculiar . While I have no doubt that au fond  . . . au fond he is a charming boy , quite charming , at present he is--shall I say ?--peculiar . I am disposed to imagine that he has been , from childhood up , systematically indulged . There has been in his life , I suspect , little or no discipline . The result has been to make him curiously unboylike . There is a complete absence of that diffidence , that childish capacity for surprise , which I for one find so charming in our English boys . Little Ford appears to be completely blase . He has tastes and ideas which are precocious , and--unusual in a boy of his age . . . . He expresses himself in a curious manner sometimes . . . . He seems to have little or no reverence for--ah--constituted authority .  He paused while he passed his handkerchief once more over his forehead .  Mr Ford , the boys father , who struck me as a man of great ability , a typical American merchant prince , was singularly frank with me about his domestic affairs as they concerned his son . I cannot recall his exact words , but the gist of what he said was that , until now , Mrs Ford had had sole charge of the boys upbringing , and--Mr Ford was singularly outspoken--was too indulgent , in fact--ah--spoilt him . Indeed--you will , of course , respect my confidence--that was the real reason for the divorce which--ah--has unhappily come about . Mr Ford regards this school as in a measure--shall I say ?--an antidote . He wishes there to be no lack of wholesome discipline . So that I shall expect you , Mr Burns , to check firmly , though , of course , kindly , such habits of his as--ah--cigarette-smoking . On our journey down he smoked incessantly . I found it impossible--without physical violence--to induce him to stop . But , of course , now that he is actually at the school , and subject to the discipline of the school  . . .  Exactly , I said .  That was all I wished to say . Perhaps it would be as well if you saw him now , Mr Burns . You will find him in the study .  He drifted away , and I went to the study to introduce myself .  A cloud of tobacco-smoke rising above the back of an easy-chair greeted me as I opened the door . Moving into the room , I perceived a pair of boots resting on the grate . I stepped to the light , and the remainder of the Little Nugget came into view .  He was lying almost at full length in the chair , his eyes fixed in dreamy abstraction upon the ceiling . As I came towards him , he drew at the cigarette between his fingers , glanced at me , looked away again , and expelled another mouthful of smoke . He was not interested in me .  Perhaps this indifference piqued me , and I saw him with prejudiced eyes . At any rate , he seemed to me a singularly unprepossessing youth . That portrait had flattered him . He had a stout body and a round , unwholesome face . His eyes were dull , and his mouth dropped discontentedly . He had the air of one who is surfeited with life .  I am disposed to imagine , as Mr Abney would have said , that my manner in addressing him was brisker and more incisive than Mr Abneys own . I was irritated by his supercilious detachment .  Throw away that cigarette , I said .  To my amazement , he did , promptly . I was beginning to wonder whether I had not been too abrupt--he gave me a curious sensation of being a man of my own age--when he produced a silver case from his pocket and opened it . I saw that the cigarette in the fender was a stump .  I took the case from his hand and threw it on to a table . For the first time he seemed really to notice my existence .  Youve got a hell of a nerve , he said .  He was certainly exhibiting his various gifts in rapid order , This , I took it , was what Mr Abney had called expressing himself in a curious manner .  And dont swear , I said .  We eyed each other narrowly for the space of some seconds .  Who are you ? he demanded .  I introduced myself .  What do you want to come butting in for ?  I am paid to butt in . Its the main duty of an assistant-master .  Oh , youre the assistant-master , are you ?  One of them . And , in passing--its a small technical point--youre supposed to call me sir during these invigorating little chats of ours .  Call you what ? Up an alley!  I beg your pardon ?  Fade away . Take a walk .  I gathered that he was meaning to convey that he had considered my proposition , but regretted his inability to entertain it .  Didnt you call your tutor sir when you were at home ?  Me ? Dont make me laugh . Ive got a cracked lip .  I gather you havent an overwhelming respect for those set in authority over you .  If you mean my tutors , I should say nix .  You use the plural . Had you a tutor before Mr Broster ?  He laughed .  Had I ? Only about ten million .  Poor devils! I said .  Whos swearing now ?  The point was well taken . I corrected myself .  Poor brutes! What happened to them ? Did they commit suicide ?  Oh , they quit . And I dont blame them . Im a pretty tough proposition , and you dont want to forget it .  He reached out for the cigarette-case . I pocketed it .  You make me tired , he said .  The sensations mutual .  Do you think you can swell around , stopping me doing things ?  Youve defined my job exactly .  Guess again . I know all about this joint . The hot-air merchant was telling me about it on the train .  I took the allusion to be to Mr Arnold Abney , and thought it rather a happy one .  Hes the boss , and nobody but him is allowed to hit the fellows . If you tried it , youd lose your job . And he aint going to , because the Dads paying double fees , and hes scared stiff hell lose me if theres any trouble .  You seem to have a grasp of the position .  Bet your life I have .  I looked at him as he sprawled in the chair .  Youre a funny kid , I said .  He stiffened , outraged . His little eyes gleamed .  Say , it looks to me as if you wanted making a head shorter . Youre a darned sight too fresh . Who do you think you are , anyway ?  Im your guardian angel , I replied . Im the fellow whos going to take you in hand and make you a little ray of sunshine about the home . I know your type backwards . Ive been in America and studied it on its native asphalt . You superfatted millionaire kids are all the same . If Dad doesnt jerk you into the office before youre out of knickerbockers , you just run to seed . You get to think youre the only thing on earth , and you go on thinking it till one day somebody comes along and shows you youre not , and then you get whats coming to you--good and hard .  He began to speak , but I was on my favourite theme , one I had studied and brooded upon since the evening when I had received a certain letter at my club .  I knew a man , I said , who started out just like you . He always had all the money he wanted: never worked: grew to think himself a sort of young prince . What happened ?  He yawned .  Im afraid Im boring you , I said .  Go on . Enjoy yourself , said the Little Nugget .  Well , its a long story , so Ill spare you it . But the moral of it was that a boy who is going to have money needs to be taken in hand and taught sense while hes young .  He stretched himself .  You talk a lot . What do you reckon youre going to do ?  I eyed him thoughtfully .  Well , everythings got to have a beginning , I said . What you seem to me to want most is exercise . Ill take you for a run every day . You wont know yourself at the end of a week .  Say , if you think youre going to get me to run--  When I grab your little hand , and start running , youll find youll soon be running too . And , years hence , when you win the Marathon at the Olympic Games , youll come to me with tears in your eyes , and youll say--  Oh , slush!  I shouldnt wonder . I looked at my watch . Meanwhile , you had better go to bed . Its past your proper time .  He stared at me in open-eyed amazement .  Bed!  Bed .  He seemed more amused than annoyed .  Say , what time do you think I usually go to bed ?  I know what time you go here . Nine oclock .  As if to support my words , the door opened , and Mrs Attwell , the matron , entered .  I think its time he came to bed , Mr Burns .  Just what I was saying , Mrs Attwell .  Youre crazy , observed the Little Nugget . Bed nothing!  Mrs Attwell looked at me despairingly .  I never saw such a boy!  The whole machinery of the school was being held up by this legal infant . Any vacillation now , and Authority would suffer a set-back from which it would be hard put to it to recover . It seemed to me a situation that called for action .  I bent down , scooped the Little Nugget out of his chair like an oyster , and made for the door . Outside he screamed incessantly . He kicked me in the stomach and then on the knee . He continued to scream . He screamed all the way upstairs . He was screaming when we reached his room .         *       *       *       *       *  Half an hour later I sat in the study , smoking thoughtfully . Reports from the seat of war told of a sullen and probably only temporary acquiescence with Fate on the part of the enemy . He was in bed , and seemed to have made up his mind to submit to the position . An air of restrained jubilation prevailed among the elder members of the establishment . Mr Abney was friendly and Mrs Attwell openly congratulatory . I was something like the hero of the hour .  But was I jubilant ? No , I was inclined to moodiness . Unforeseen difficulties had arisen in my path . Till now , I had regarded this kidnapping as something abstract . Personality had not entered into the matter . If I had had any picture in my minds eye , it was of myself stealing away softly into the night with a docile child , his little hand laid trustfully in mine . From what I had seen and heard of Ogden Ford in moments of emotion , it seemed to me that whoever wanted to kidnap him with any approach to stealth would need to use chloroform .  Things were getting very complex .     Chapter 3   I have never kept a diary , and I have found it , in consequence , somewhat difficult , in telling this narrative , to arrange the minor incidents of my story in their proper sequence . I am writing by the light of an imperfect memory; and the work is complicated by the fact that the early days of my sojourn at Sanstead House are a blur , a confused welter like a Futurist picture , from which emerge haphazard the figures of boys--boys working , boys eating , boys playing football , boys whispering , shouting , asking questions , banging doors , jumping on beds , and clattering upstairs and along passages , the whole picture faintly scented with a composite aroma consisting of roast beef , ink , chalk , and that curious classroom smell which is like nothing else on earth .  I cannot arrange the incidents . I can see Mr Abney , furrowed as to the brow and drooping at the jaw , trying to separate Ogden Ford from a half-smoked cigar-stump . I can hear Glossop , feverishly angry , bellowing at an amused class . A dozen other pictures come back to me , but I cannot place them in their order; and perhaps , after all , their sequence is unimportant . This story deals with affairs which were outside the ordinary school life .  With the war between the Little Nugget and Authority , for instance , the narrative has little to do . It is a subject for an epic , but it lies apart from the main channel of the story , and must be avoided . To tell of his gradual taming , of the chaos his advent caused until we became able to cope with him , would be to turn this story into a treatise on education . It is enough to say that the process of moulding his character and exorcising the devil which seemed to possess him was slow .  It was Ogden who introduced tobacco-chewing into the school , with fearful effects one Saturday night on the aristocratic interiors of Lords Gartridge and Windhall and Honourables Edwin Bellamy and Hildebrand Kyne . It was the ingenious gambling-game imported by Ogden which was rapidly undermining the moral sense of twenty-four innocent English boys when it was pounced upon by Glossop . It was Ogden who , on the one occasion when Mr Abney reluctantly resorted to the cane , and administered four mild taps with it , relieved his feelings by going upstairs and breaking all the windows in all the bedrooms .  We had some difficult young charges at Sanstead House . Abneys policy of benevolent toleration ensured that . But Ogden Ford stood alone .         *       *       *       *       *  I have said that it is difficult for me to place the lesser events of my narrative in their proper order . I except three , however which I will call the Affair of the Strange American , the Adventure of the Sprinting Butler , and the Episode of the Genial Visitor .  I will describe them singly , as they happened .  It was the custom at Sanstead House for each of the assistant masters to take half of one day in every week as a holiday . The allowance was not liberal , and in most schools , I believe , it is increased; but Mr Abney was a man with peculiar views on other peoples holidays , and Glossop and I were accordingly restricted .  My day was Wednesday; and on the Wednesday of which I write I strolled towards the village . I had in my mind a game of billiards at the local inn . Sanstead House and its neighbourhood were lacking in the fiercer metropolitan excitements , and billiards at the Feathers constituted for the pleasure-seeker the beginning and end of the Gay Whirl .  There was a local etiquette governing the game of billiards at the Feathers . You played the marker a hundred up , then you took him into the bar-parlour and bought him refreshment . He raised his glass , said , To you , sir , and drained it at a gulp . After that you could , if you wished , play another game , or go home , as your fancy dictated .  There was only one other occupant of the bar-parlour when we adjourned thither , and a glance at him told me that he was not ostentatiously sober . He was lying back in a chair , with his feet on the side-table , and crooning slowly , in a melancholy voice , the following words:    I dont care--if he wears--a crown ,   He--cant--keep kicking my--dawg aroun .  He was a tough , clean-shaven man , with a broken nose , over which was tilted a soft felt hat . His wiry limbs were clad in what I put down as a mail-order suit . I could have placed him by his appearance , if I had not already done so by his voice , as an East-side New Yorker . And what an East-side New Yorker could be doing in Sanstead it was beyond me to explain .  We had hardly seated ourselves when he rose and lurched out . I saw him pass the window , and his assertion that no crowned head should molest his dog came faintly to my ears as he went down the street .  American! said Miss Benjafield , the stately barmaid , with strong disapproval . Theyre all alike .  I never contradict Miss Benjafield--one would as soon contradict the Statue of Liberty--so I merely breathed sympathetically .  Whats he here for Id like to know ?  It occurred to me that I also should like to know . In another thirty hours I was to find out .  I shall lay myself open to a charge of denseness such as even Doctor Watson would have scorned when I say that , though I thought of the matter a good deal on my way back to the school , I did not arrive at the obvious solution . Much teaching and taking of duty had dulled my wits , and the presence at Sanstead House of the Little Nugget did not even occur to me as a reason why strange Americans should be prowling in the village .  We now come to the remarkable activity of White , the butler .  It happened that same evening .  It was not late when I started on my way back to the house , but the short January day was over , and it was very dark as I turned in at the big gate of the school and made my way up the drive . The drive at Sanstead House was a fine curving stretch of gravel , about two hundred yards in length , flanked on either side by fir trees and rhododendrons . I stepped out briskly , for it had begun to freeze . Just as I caught sight through the trees of the lights of the windows , there came to me the sound of running feet .  I stopped . The noise grew louder . There seemed to be two runners , one moving with short , quick steps , the other , the one in front , taking a longer stride .  I drew aside instinctively . In another moment , making a great clatter on the frozen gravel , the first of the pair passed me; and as he did so , there was a sharp crack , and something sang through the darkness like a large mosquito .  The effect of the sound on the man who had been running was immediate . He stopped in his stride and dived into the bushes . His footsteps thudded faintly on the turf .  The whole incident had lasted only a few seconds , and I was still standing there when I was aware of the other man approaching . He had apparently given up the pursuit , for he was walking quite slowly . He stopped within a few feet of me and I heard him swearing softly to himself .  Whos that ? I cried sharply . The crack of the pistol had given a flick to my nerves . Mine had been a sheltered life , into which hitherto revolver-shots had not entered , and I was resenting this abrupt introduction of them . I felt jumpy and irritated .  It gave me a malicious pleasure to see that I had startled the unknown dispenser of shocks quite as much as he had startled me . The movement he made as he faced towards my direction was almost a leap; and it suddenly flashed upon me that I had better at once establish my identity as a non-combatant . I appeared to have wandered inadvertently into the midst of a private quarrel , one party to which--the one standing a couple of yards from me with a loaded revolver in his hand--was evidently a man of impulse , the sort of man who would shoot first and inquire afterwards .  Im Mr Burns , I said . Im one of the assistant-masters . Who are you ?  Mr Burns ?  Surely that rich voice was familiar .  White ? I said .  Yes , sir .  What on earth do you think youre doing ? Have you gone mad ? Who was that man ?  I wish I could tell you , sir . A very doubtful character . I found him prowling at the back of the house very suspiciously . He took to his heels and I followed him .  But--I spoke querulously , my orderly nature was shocked--you cant go shooting at people like that just because you find them at the back of the house . He might have been a tradesman .  I think not , sir .  Well , so do I , if it comes to that . He didnt behave like one . But all the same--  I take your point , sir . But I was merely intending to frighten him .  You succeeded all right . He went through those bushes like a cannon-ball .  I heard him chuckle .  I think I may have scared him a little , sir .  We must phone to the police-station . Could you describe the man ?  I think not , sir . It was very dark . And , if I may make the suggestion , it would be better not to inform the police . I have a very poor opinion of these country constables .  But we cant have men prowling--  If you will permit me , sir . I say--let them prowl . Its the only way to catch them .  If you think this sort of thing is likely to happen again I must tell Mr Abney .  Pardon me , sir , I think it would be better not . He impresses me as a somewhat nervous gentleman , and it would only disturb him .  At this moment it suddenly struck me that , in my interest in the mysterious fugitive , I had omitted to notice what was really the most remarkable point in the whole affair . How did White happen to have a revolver at all ? I have met many butlers who behaved unexpectedly in their spare time . One I knew played the fiddle; another preached Socialism in Hyde Park . But I had never yet come across a butler who fired pistols .  What were you doing with a revolver ? I asked .  He hesitated .  May I ask you to keep it to yourself , sir , if I tell you something ? he said at last .  What do you mean ?  Im a detective .  What!  A Pinkertons man , Mr Burns .  I felt like one who sees the danger board over thin ice . But for this information , who knew what rash move I might not have made , under the assumption that the Little Nugget was unguarded ? At the same time , I could not help reflecting that , if things had been complex before , they had become far more so in the light of this discovery . To spirit Ogden away had never struck me , since his arrival at the school , as an easy task . It seemed more difficult now than ever .  I had the sense to affect astonishment . I made my imitation of an innocent assistant-master astounded by the news that the butler is a detective in disguise as realistic as I was able . It appeared to be satisfactory , for he began to explain .  I am employed by Mr Elmer Ford to guard his son . There are several parties after that boy , Mr Burns . Naturally he is a considerable prize . Mr Ford would pay a large sum to get back his only son if he were kidnapped . So it stands to reason he takes precautions .  Does Mr Abney know what you are ?  No , sir . Mr Abney thinks I am an ordinary butler . You are the only person who knows , and I have only told you because you have happened to catch me in a rather queer position for a butler to be in . You will keep it to yourself , sir ? It doesnt do for it to get about . These things have to be done quietly . It would be bad for the school if my presence here were advertised . The other parents wouldnt like it . They would think that their sons were in danger , you see . It would be disturbing for them . So if you will just forget what Ive been telling you , Mr Burns--  I assured him that I would . But I was very far from meaning it . If there was one thing which I intended to bear in mind , it was the fact that watchful eyes besides mine were upon that Little Nugget .  The third and last of this chain of occurrences , the Episode of the Genial Visitor , took place on the following day , and may be passed over briefly . All that happened was that a well-dressed man , who gave his name as Arthur Gordon , of Philadelphia , dropped in unexpectedly to inspect the school . He apologized for not having written to make an appointment , but explained that he was leaving England almost immediately . He was looking for a school for his sisters son , and , happening to meet his business acquaintance , Mr Elmer Ford , in London , he had been recommended to Mr Abney . He made himself exceedingly pleasant . He was a breezy , genial man , who joked with Mr Abney , chaffed the boys , prodded the Little Nugget in the ribs , to that overfed youths discomfort , made a rollicking tour of the house , in the course of which he inspected Ogdens bedroom--in order , he told Mr Abney , to be able to report conscientiously to his friend Ford that the son and heir was not being pampered too much , and departed in a whirl of good-humour , leaving every one enthusiastic over his charming personality . His last words were that everything was thoroughly satisfactory , and that he had learned all he wanted to know .  Which , as was proved that same night , was the simple truth .     Chapter 4   I  I owed it to my colleague Glossop that I was in the centre of the surprising things that occurred that night . By sheer weight of boredom , Glossop drove me from the house , so that it came about that , at half past nine , the time at which the affair began , I was patrolling the gravel in front of the porch .  It was the practice of the staff of Sanstead House School to assemble after dinner in Mr Abneys study for coffee . The room was called the study , but it was really more of a masters common room . Mr Abney had a smaller sanctum of his own , reserved exclusively for himself .  On this particular night he went there early , leaving me alone with Glossop . It is one of the drawbacks of the desert-island atmosphere of a private school that everybody is always meeting everybody else . To avoid a man for long is impossible . I had been avoiding Glossop as long as I could , for I knew that he wanted to corner me with a view to a heart-to-heart talk on Life Insurance .  These amateur Life Insurance agents are a curious band . The world is full of them . I have met them at country-houses , at seaside hotels , on ships , everywhere; and it has always amazed me that they should find the game worth the candle . What they add to their incomes I do not know , but it cannot be very much , and the trouble they have to take is colossal . Nobody loves them , and they must see it; yet they persevere . Glossop , for instance , had been trying to buttonhole me every time there was a five minutes break in the days work .  He had his chance now , and he did not mean to waste it . Mr Abney had scarcely left the room when he began to exude pamphlets and booklets at every pocket .  I eyed him sourly , as he droned on about reactionable endowment , surrender-value , and interest accumulating on the tontine policy , and tried , as I did so , to analyse the loathing I felt for him . I came to the conclusion that it was partly due to his pose of doing the whole thing from purely altruistic motives , entirely for my good , and partly because he forced me to face the fact that I was not always going to be young . In an abstract fashion I had already realized that I should in time cease to be thirty , but the way in which Glossop spoke of my sixty-fifth birthday made me feel as if it was due tomorrow . He was a man with a manner suggestive of a funeral mute suffering from suppressed jaundice , and I had never before been so weighed down with a sense of the inevitability of decay and the remorseless passage of time . I could feel my hair whitening .  A need for solitude became imperative; and , murmuring something about thinking it over , I escaped from the room .  Except for my bedroom , whither he was quite capable of following me , I had no refuge but the grounds . I unbolted the front door and went out .  It was still freezing , and , though the stars shone , the trees grew so closely about the house that it was too dark for me to see more than a few feet in front of me .  I began to stroll up and down . The night was wonderfully still . I could hear somebody walking up the drive--one of the maids , I supposed , returning from her evening out . I could even hear a bird rustling in the ivy on the walls of the stables .  I fell into a train of thought . I think my mind must still have been under Glossops gloom-breeding spell , for I was filled with a sense of the infinite pathos of Life . What was the good of it all ? Why was a man given chances of happiness without the sense to realize and use them ? If Nature had made me so self-satisfied that I had lost Audrey because of my self-satisfaction why had she not made me so self-satisfied that I could lose her without a pang ? Audrey! It annoyed me that , whenever I was free for a moment from active work , my thoughts should keep turning to her . It frightened me , too . Engaged to Cynthia , I had no right to have such thoughts .  Perhaps it was the mystery which hung about her that kept her in my mind . I did not know where she was . I did not know how she fared . I did not know what sort of a man it was whom she had preferred to me . That , it struck me , was the crux of the matter . She had vanished absolutely with another man whom I had never seen and whose very name I did not know . I had been beaten by an unseen foe .  I was deep in a very slough of despond when suddenly things began to happen . I might have known that Sanstead House would never permit solitary brooding on Life for long . It was a place of incident , not of abstract speculation .  I had reached the end of my beat , and had stopped to relight my pipe , when drama broke loose with the swift unexpectedness which was characteristic of the place . The stillness of the night was split by a sound which I could have heard in a gale and recognized among a hundred conflicting noises . It was a scream , a shrill , piercing squeal that did not rise to a crescendo , but started at its maximum and held the note; a squeal which could only proceed from one throat: the deafening war-cry of the Little Nugget .  I had grown accustomed , since my arrival at Sanstead House , to a certain quickening of the pace of life , but tonight events succeeded one another with a rapidity which surprised me . A whole cinematograph-drama was enacted during the space of time it takes for a wooden match to burn .  At the moment when the Little Nugget gave tongue , I had just struck one , and I stood , startled into rigidity , holding it in the air as if I had decided to constitute myself a sort of limelight man to the performance .  It cannot have been more than a few seconds later before some person unknown nearly destroyed me .  I was standing , holding my match and listening to the sounds of confusion indoors , when this person , rounding the angle of the house in a desperate hurry , emerged from the bushes and rammed me squarely .  He was a short man , or he must have crouched as he ran , for his shoulder--a hard , bony shoulder--was precisely the same distance from the ground as my solar plexus . In the brief impact which ensued between the two , the shoulder had the advantage of being in motion , while the solar plexus was stationary , and there was no room for any shadow of doubt as to which had the worst of it .  That the mysterious unknown was not unshaken by the encounter was made clear by a sharp yelp of surprise and pain . He staggered . What happened to him after that was not a matter of interest to me . I gather that he escaped into the night . But I was too occupied with my own affairs to follow his movements .  Of all cures for melancholy introspection a violent blow in the solar plexus is the most immediate . If Mr Corbett had any abstract worries that day at Carson City , I fancy they ceased to occupy his mind from the moment when Mr Fitzsimmons administered that historic left jab . In my case the cure was instantaneous . I can remember reeling across the gravel and falling in a heap and trying to breathe and knowing that I should never again be able to , and then for some minutes all interest in the affairs of this world left me .  How long it was before my breath returned , hesitatingly , like some timid Prodigal Son trying to muster up courage to enter the old home , I do not know; but it cannot have been many minutes , for the house was only just beginning to disgorge its occupants as I sat up . Disconnected cries and questions filled the air . Dim forms moved about in the darkness .  I had started to struggle to my feet , feeling very sick and boneless , when it was borne in upon me that the sensations of this remarkable night were not yet over . As I reached a sitting position , and paused before adventuring further , to allow a wave of nausea to pass , a hand was placed on my shoulder and a voice behind me said , Dont move!   II  I was not in a condition to argue . Beyond a fleeting feeling that a liberty was being taken with me and that I was being treated unjustly , I do not remember resenting the command . I had no notion who the speaker might be , and no curiosity . Breathing just then had all the glamour of a difficult feat cleverly performed . I concentrated my whole attention upon it . I was pleased , and surprised , to find myself getting on so well . I remember having much the same sensation when I first learned to ride a bicycle--a kind of dazed feeling that I seemed to be doing it , but Heaven alone knew how .  A minute or so later , when I had leisure to observe outside matters , I perceived that among the other actors in the drama confusion still reigned . There was much scuttering about and much meaningless shouting . Mr Abneys reedy tenor voice was issuing directions , each of which reached a dizzier height of futility than the last . Glossop was repeating over and over again the words , Shall I telephone for the police ? to which nobody appeared to pay the least attention . One or two boys were darting about like rabbits and squealing unintelligibly . A female voice--I think Mrs Attwells--was saying , Can you see him ?  Up to this point , my match , long since extinguished , had been the only illumination the affair had received; but now somebody , who proved to be White , the butler , came from the direction of the stable-yard with a carriage-lamp . Every one seemed calmer and happier for it . The boys stopped squealing , Mrs Attwell and Glossop subsided , and Mr Abney said Ah! in a self-satisfied voice , as if he had directed this move and was congratulating himself on the success with which it had been carried out .  The whole strength of the company gathered round the light .  Thank you , White , said Mr Abney . Excellent . I fear the scoundrel has escaped .  I suspect so , sir .  This is a very remarkable occurrence , White .  Yes , sir .  The man was actually in Master Fords bedroom .  Indeed , sir ?  A shrill voice spoke . I recognized it as that of Augustus Beckford , always to be counted upon to be in the centre of things gathering information .  Sir , please , sir , what was up ? Who was it , sir ? Sir , was it a burglar , sir ? Have you ever met a burglar , sir ? My father took me to see Raffles in the holidays , sir . Do you think this chap was like Raffles , sir ? Sir--  It was undoubtedly-- Mr Abney was beginning , when the identity of the questioner dawned upon him , and for the first time he realized that the drive was full of boys actively engaged in catching their deaths of cold . His all-friends-here-let-us- discuss-this-interesting-episode-fully manner changed . He became the outraged schoolmaster . Never before had I heard him speak so sharply to boys , many of whom , though breaking rules , were still titled .  What are you boys doing out of bed ? Go back to bed instantly . I shall punish you most severely . I--  Shall I telephone for the police ? asked Glossop . Disregarded .  I will not have this conduct . You will catch cold . This is disgraceful . Ten bad marks! I shall punish you most severely if you do not instantly--  A calm voice interrupted him .  Say!  The Little Nugget strolled easily into the circle of light . He was wearing a dressing-gown , and in his hand was a smouldering cigarette , from which he proceeded , before continuing his remarks , to blow a cloud of smoke .  Say , I guess youre wrong . That wasnt any ordinary porch-climber .  The spectacle of his bete noire wreathed in smoke , coming on top of the emotions of the night , was almost too much for Mr Abney . He gesticulated for a moment in impassioned silence , his arms throwing grotesque shadows on the gravel .  How dare you smoke , boy! How dare you smoke that cigarette!  Its the only one Ive got , responded the Little Nugget amiably .  I have spoken to you--I have warned you--Ten bad marks!--I will not have--Fifteen bad marks!  The Little Nugget ignored the painful scene . He was smiling quietly .  If you ask me , he said , that guy was after something better than plated spoons . Yes , sir! If you want my opinion , it was Buck MacGinnis , or Chicago Ed . , or one of those guys , and what he was trailing was me . Theyre always at it . Buck had a try for me in the fall of 07 , and Ed .--  Do you hear me ? Will you return instantly--  If you dont believe me I can show you the piece there was about it in the papers . Ive got a press-clipping album in my box . Whenever theres a piece about me in the papers , I cut it out and paste it into my album . If youll come right along , Ill show you the story about Buck now . It happened in Chicago , and hed have got away with me if it hadnt been--  Twenty bad marks!  Mr Abney!  It was the person standing behind me who spoke . Till now he or she had remained a silent spectator , waiting , I suppose , for a lull in the conversation .  They jumped , all together , like a well-trained chorus .  Who is that ? cried Mr Abney . I could tell by the sound of his voice that his nerves were on wires . Who was that who spoke ?  Shall I telephone for the police ? asked Glossop . Ignored .  I am Mrs Sheridan , Mr Abney . You were expecting me to-night .  Mrs Sheridan ? Mrs Sher--I expected you in a cab . I expected you in--ah--in fact , a cab .  I walked .  I had a curious sensation of having heard the voice before . When she had told me not to move , she had spoken in a whisper--or , to me , in my dazed state , it had sounded like a whisper--but now she was raising her voice , and there was a note in it that seemed familiar . It stirred some chord in my memory , and I waited to hear it again .  When it came it brought the same sensation , but nothing more definite . It left me groping for the clue .  Here is one of the men , Mr Abney .  There was a profound sensation . Boys who had ceased to squeal , squealed with fresh vigour . Glossop made his suggestion about the telephone with a new ring of hope in his voice . Mrs Attwell shrieked . They made for us in a body , boys and all , White leading with the lantern . I was almost sorry for being compelled to provide an anticlimax .  Augustus Beckford was the first to recognize me , and I expect he was about to ask me if I liked sitting on the gravel on a frosty night , or what gravel was made of , when Mr Abney spoke .  Mr Burns! What--dear me!--what are you doing there ?  Perhaps Mr Burns can give us some information as to where the man went , sir , suggested White .  On everything except that , I said , Im a mine of information . I havent the least idea where he went . All I know about him is that he has a shoulder like the ram of a battleship , and that he charged me with it .  As I was speaking , I thought I heard a little gasp behind me . I turned . I wanted to see this woman who stirred my memory with her voice . But the rays of the lantern did not fall on her , and she was a shapeless blur in the darkness . Somehow I felt that she was looking intently at me .  I resumed my narrative .  I was lighting my pipe when I heard a scream-- A chuckle came from the group behind the lantern .  I screamed , said the Little Nugget . You bet I screamed! What would you do if you woke up in the dark and found a strong-armed roughneck prising you out of bed as if you were a clam ? He tried to get his hand over my mouth , but he only connected with my forehead , and Id got going before he could switch . I guess I threw a scare into that gink!  He chuckled again , reminiscently , and drew at his cigarette .  How dare you smoke! Throw away that cigarette! cried Mr Abney , roused afresh by the red glow .  Forget it! advised the Little Nugget tersely .  And then , I said , somebody whizzed out from nowhere and hit me . And after that I didnt seem to care much about him or anything else . I spoke in the direction of my captor . She was still standing outside the circle of light . I expect you can tell us what happened , Mrs Sheridan ?  I did not think that her information was likely to be of any practical use , but I wanted to make her speak again .  Her first words were enough . I wondered how I could ever have been in doubt . I knew the voice now . It was one which I had not heard for five years , but one which I could never forget if I lived for ever .  Somebody ran past me . I hardly heard her . My heart was pounding , and a curious dizziness had come over me . I was grappling with the incredible . I think he went into the bushes .  I heard Glossop speak , and gathered from Mr Abneys reply; that he had made his suggestion about the telephone once more .  I think that will be--ah--unnecessary , Mr Glossop . The man has undoubtedly--ah--made good his escape . I think we had all better return to the house . He turned to the dim figure beside me . Ah , Mrs Sheridan , you must be tired after your journey and the--ah unusual excitement . Mrs Attwell will show you where you--in fact , your room .  In the general movement White must have raised the lamp or stepped forward , for the rays shifted . The figure beside me was no longer dim , but stood out sharp and clear in the yellow light .  I was aware of two large eyes looking into mine as , in the grey London morning two weeks before , they had looked from a faded photograph .     Chapter 5   Of all the emotions which kept me awake that night , a vague discomfort and a feeling of resentment against Fate more than against any individual , were the two that remained with me next morning . Astonishment does not last . The fact of Audrey and myself being under the same roof after all these years had ceased to amaze me . It was a minor point , and my mind shelved it in order to deal with the one thing that really mattered , the fact that she had come back into my life just when I had definitely , as I thought , put her out of it .  My resentment deepened . Fate had played me a wanton trick . Cynthia trusted me . If I were weak , I should not be the only one to suffer . And something told me that I should be weak . How could I hope to be strong , tortured by the thousand memories which the sight of her would bring back to me ?  But I would fight , I told myself . I would not yield easily . I promised that to my self-respect , and was rewarded with a certain glow of excitement . I felt defiant . I wanted to test myself at once .  My opportunity came after breakfast . She was standing on the gravel in front of the house , almost , in fact , on the spot where we had met the night before . She looked up as she heard my step , and I saw that her chin had that determined tilt which , in the days of our engagement , I had noticed often without attaching any particular significance to it . Heavens , what a ghastly lump of complacency I must have been in those days! A child , I thought , if he were not wrapped up in the contemplation of his own magnificence , could read its meaning .  It meant war , and I was glad of it . I wanted war .  Good morning , I said .  Good morning .  There was a pause . I took the opportunity to collect my thoughts .  I looked at her curiously . Five years had left their mark on her , but entirely for the good . She had an air of quiet strength which I had never noticed in her before . It may have been there in the old days , but I did not think so . It was , I felt certain , a later development . She gave the impression of having been through much and of being sure of herself .  In appearance she had changed amazingly little . She looked as small and slight and trim as ever she had done . She was a little paler , I thought , and the Irish eyes were older and a shade harder; but that was all .  I awoke with a start to the fact that I was staring at her . A slight flush had crept into her pale cheeks .  Dont! she said suddenly , with a little gesture of irritation .  The word and the gesture killed , as if they had been a blow , a kind of sentimental tenderness which had been stealing over me .  What are you doing here ? I asked .  She was silent .  Please dont think I want to pry into your affairs , I said viciously . I was only interested in the coincidence that we should meet here like this .  She turned to me impulsively . Her face had lost its hard look .  Oh , Peter , she said , Im sorry . I am sorry .  It was my chance , and I snatched at it with a lack of chivalry which I regretted almost immediately . But I was feeling bitter , and bitterness makes a man do cheap things .  Sorry ? I said , politely puzzled . Why ?  She looked taken aback , as I hoped she would .  For--for what happened .  My dear Audrey! Anybody would have made the same mistake . I dont wonder you took me for a burglar .  I didnt mean that . I meant--five years ago .  I laughed . I was not feeling like laughter at the moment , but I did my best , and had the satisfaction of seeing that it jarred upon her .  Surely youre not worrying yourself about that ? I said . I laughed again . Very jovial and debonair I was that winter morning .  The brief moment in which we might have softened towards each other was over . There was a glitter in her blue eyes which told me that it was once more war between us .  I thought you would get over it , she said .  Well , I said , I was only twenty-five . Ones heart doesnt break at twenty-five .  I dont think yours would ever be likely to break , Peter .  Is that a compliment , or otherwise ?  You would probably think it a compliment . I meant that you were not human enough to be heart-broken .  So thats your idea of a compliment!  I said I thought it was probably yours .  I must have been a curious sort of man five years ago , if I gave you that impression .  You were .  She spoke in a meditative voice , as if , across the years , she were idly inspecting some strange species of insect . The attitude annoyed me . I could look , myself , with a detached eye at the man I had once been , but I still retained a sort of affection for him , and I felt piqued .  I suppose you looked on me as a kind of ogre in those days ? I said .  I suppose I did .  There was a pause .  I didnt mean to hurt your feelings , she said . And that was the most galling part of it . Mine was an attitude of studied offensiveness . I did want to hurt her feelings . But hers , it seemed to me , was no pose . She really had had--and , I suppose , still retained--a genuine horror of me . The struggle was unequal .  You were very kind , she went on , sometimes--when you happened to think of it .  Considered as the best she could find to say of me , it was not an eulogy .  Well , I said , we neednt discuss what I was or did five years ago . Whatever I was or did , you escaped . Lets think of the present . What are we going to do about this ?  You think the situations embarrassing ?  I do .  One of us ought to go , I suppose , she said doubtfully .  Exactly .  Well , I cant go .  Nor can I .  I have business here .  Obviously , so have I .  Its absolutely necessary that I should be here .  And that I should .  She considered me for a moment .  Mrs Attwell told me that you were one of the assistant-masters at the school .  I am acting as assistant-master . I am supposed to be learning the business .  She hesitated .  Why ? she said .  Why not ?  But--but--you used to be very well off .  Im better off now . Im working .  She was silent for a moment .  Of course its impossible for you to leave . You couldnt , could you ?  No .  I cant either .  Then I suppose we must face the embarrassment .  But why must it be embarrassing ? You said yourself you had--got over it .  Absolutely . I am engaged to be married .  She gave a little start . She drew a pattern on the gravel with her foot before she spoke .  I congratulate you , she said at last .  Thank you .  I hope you will be very happy .  Im sure I shall .  She relapsed into silence . It occurred to me that , having posted her thoroughly in my affairs , I was entitled to ask about hers .  How in the world did you come to be here ? I said .  Its rather a long story . After my husband died--  Oh! I exclaimed , startled .  Yes; he died three years ago .  She spoke in a level voice , with a ring of hardness in it , for which I was to learn the true reason later . At the time it seemed to me due to resentment at having to speak of the man she had loved to me , whom she disliked , and my bitterness increased .  I have been looking after myself for a long time .  In England ?  In America . We went to New York directly we--directly I had written to you . I have been in America ever since . I only returned to England a few weeks ago .  But what brought you to Sanstead ?  Some years ago I got to know Mr Ford , the father of the little boy who is at the school . He recommended me to Mr Abney , who wanted somebody to help with the school .  And you are dependent on your work ? I mean--forgive me if I am personal--Mr Sheridan did not--  He left no money at all .  Who was he ? I burst out . I felt that the subject of the dead man was one which it was painful for her to talk about , at any rate to me; but the Sheridan mystery had vexed me for five years , and I thirsted to know something of this man who had dynamited my life without ever appearing in it .  He was an artist , a friend of my father .  I wanted to hear more . I wanted to know what he looked like , how he spoke , how he compared with me in a thousand ways; but it was plain that she would not willingly be communicative about him; and , with a feeling of resentment , I gave her her way and suppressed my curiosity .  So your work here is all you have ? I said .  Absolutely all . And , if its the same with you , well , here we are!  Here we are! I echoed . Exactly .  We must try and make it as easy for each other as we can , she said .  Of course .  She looked at me in that curious , wide-eyed way of hers .  You have got thinner , Peter , she said .  Have I ? I said . Suffering , I suppose , or exercise .  Her eyes left my face . I saw her bite her lip .  You hate me , she said abruptly . Youve been hating me all these years . Well , I dont wonder .  She turned and began to walk slowly away , and as she did so a sense of the littleness of the part I was playing came over me . Ever since our talk had begun I had been trying to hurt her , trying to take a petty revenge on her--for what ? All that had happened five years ago had been my fault . I could not let her go like this . I felt unutterably mean .  Audrey! I called .  She stopped . I went to her .  Audrey! I said , youre wrong . If theres anybody I hate , its myself . I just want to tell you I understand .  Her lips parted , but she did not speak .  I understand just what made you do it , I went on . I can see now the sort of man I was in those days .  Youre saying that to--to help me , she said in a low voice .  No . I have felt like that about it for years .  I treated you shamefully .  Nothing of the kind . Theres a certain sort of man who badly needs a--jolt , and he has to get it sooner or later . It happened that you gave me mine , but that wasnt your fault . I was bound to get it--somehow . I laughed . Fate was waiting for me round the corner . Fate wanted something to hit me with . You happened to be the nearest thing handy .  Im sorry , Peter .  Nonsense . You knocked some sense into me . Thats all you did . Every man needs education . Most men get theirs in small doses , so that they hardly know they are getting it at all . My money kept me from getting mine that way . By the time I met you there was a great heap of back education due to me , and I got it in a lump . Thats all .  Youre generous .  Nothing of the kind . Its only that I see things clearer than I did . I was a pig in those days .  You werent!  I was . Well , we wont quarrel about it .  Inside the house the bell rang for breakfast . We turned . As I drew back to let her go in , she stopped .  Peter , she said .  She began to speak quickly .  Peter , lets be sensible . Why should we let this embarrass us , this being together here ? Cant we just pretend that were two old friends who parted through a misunderstanding , and have come together again , with all the misunderstanding cleared away--friends again ? Shall we ?  She held out her hand . She was smiling , but her eyes were grave .  Old friends , Peter ?  I took her hand .  Old friends , I said .  And we went in to breakfast . On the table , beside my plate , was lying a letter from Cynthia .     Chapter 6   I  I give the letter in full . It was written from the s .y . Mermaid , lying in Monaco Harbour .  MY DEAR PETER , Where is Ogden ? We have been expecting him every day . Mrs Ford is worrying herself to death . She keeps asking me if I have any news , and it is very tiresome to have to keep telling her that I have not heard from you . Surely , with the opportunities you must get every day , you can manage to kidnap him . Do be quick . We are relying on you .--In haste ,                                   CYNTHIA .  I read this brief and business-like communication several times during the day; and after dinner that night , in order to meditate upon it in solitude , I left the house and wandered off in the direction of the village .  I was midway between house and village when I became aware that I was being followed . The night was dark , and the wind moving in the tree-tops emphasized the loneliness of the country road . Both time and place were such as made it peculiarly unpleasant to hear stealthy footsteps on the road behind me .  Uncertainty in such cases is the unnerving thing . I turned sharply , and began to walk back on tiptoe in the direction from which I had come .  I had not been mistaken . A moment later a dark figure loomed up out of the darkness , and the exclamation which greeted me , as I made my presence known , showed that I had taken him by surprise .  There was a momentary pause . I expected the man , whoever he might be , to run , but he held his ground . Indeed , he edged forward .  Get back! I said , and allowed my stick to rasp suggestively on the road before raising it in readiness for any sudden development . It was as well that he should know it was there .  The hint seemed to wound rather than frighten him .  Aw , cut out the rough stuff , bo , he said reproachfully in a cautious , husky undertone . I aint goin to start anything .  I had an impression that I had heard the voice before , but I could not place it .  What are you following me for ? I demanded . Who are you ?  Say , I want a talk wit youse . I took a slant at youse under de lamp-post back dere , an I seen it was you , so I tagged along . Say , Im wise to your game , sport .  I had identified him by this time . Unless there were two men in the neighbourhood of Sanstead who hailed from the Bowery , this must be the man I had seen at the Feathers who had incurred the disapproval of Miss Benjafield .  I havent the faintest idea what you mean , I said . What is my game ?  His voice became reproachful again .  Ah chee! he protested . Quit yer kiddin! What was youse rubberin around de house for last night if you wasnt trailin de kid ?  Was it you who ran into me last night ? I asked .  Gee! I fought it was a tree . I came near takin de count .  I did take it . You seemed in a great hurry .  Hell! said the man simply , and expectorated .  Say , he resumed , having delivered this criticism on that stirring episode , dats a great kid , dat Nugget . I fought it was a Black Hand soup explosion when he cut loose . But , say , lets dont waste time . We gotta get together about dat kid .  Certainly , if you wish it . What do you happen to mean ?  Aw , quit yer kiddin! He expectorated again . He seemed to be a man who could express the whole gamut of emotions by this simple means . I know you!  Then you have the advantage of me , though I believe I remember seeing you before . Werent you at the Feathers one Wednesday evening , singing something about a dog ?  Sure . Dat was me .  What do you mean by saying that you know me ?  Aw , quit yer kiddin , Sam!  There was , it seemed to me , a reluctantly admiring note in his voice .  Tell me , who do you think I am ? I asked patiently .  Ahr ghee! You cant string me , sport . Smooth Sam Fisher , is who you are , bo . I know you .  I was too surprised to speak . Verily , some have greatness thrust upon them .  I haint never seen youse , Sam , he continued , but I know its you . And Ill tell youse how I doped it out . To begin with , there aint but you and your bunch and me and my bunch dat knows de Little Nuggets on dis side at all . Dey sneaked him out of New York mighty slick . And I heard that you had come here after him . So when I runs into a guy dats trailin de kid down here , well , whos it going to be if it aint youse ? And when dat guy talks like a dude , like they all say you do , well , whos it going to be if it aint youse ? So quit yer kiddin , Sam , and lets get down to business .  Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr Buck MacGinnis ? I said . I felt convinced that this could be no other than that celebrity .  Dats right . Deres no need to keep up anyting wit me , Sam . Were bote on de same trail , so lets get down to it .  One moment , I said . Would it surprise you to hear that my name is Burns , and that I am a master at the school ?  He expectorated admirably .  Hell , no! he said . Gee , its just what you would be , Sam . I always heard youse had been one of dese rah-rah boys oncest . Say , its mighty smart of youse to be a perfessor . Youre right in on de ground floor .  His voice became appealing .  Say , Sam , dont be a hawg . Lets go fifty-fifty in dis deal . My bunch and me has come a hell of a number of miles on dis proposition , and dere aint no need for us to fall scrappin over it . Deres plenty for all of us . Old man Fordll cough up enough for every one , and dere wont be any fuss . Lets sit in togedder on dis nuggetting . It aint like as if it was an ornery two-by-four deal . I wouldnt ask youse if it wasnt big enough fir de whole bunch of us .  As I said nothing , he proceeded .  It aint square , Sam , to take advantage of your having education . If it was a square fight , and us bote wit de same chance , I wouldnt say; but you bein a dude perfessor and gettin right into de place like dat aint right . Say , dont be a hawg , Sam . Dont swipe it all . Fifty-fifty! Does dat go ?  I dont know , I said . You had better ask the real Sam . Good night .  I walked past him and made for the school gates at my best pace . He trotted after me , pleading .  Sam , give us a quarter , then .  I walked on .  Sam , dont be a hawg!  He broke into a run .  Sam! His voice lost its pleading tone and rasped menacingly .  Gee , if I had me canister , youse wouldnt be so flip! Listen here , you big cheese! You tink youse is de only ting in sight , huh ? Well , we aint done yet . Youll see yet . Well fix you! Youse had best watch out .  I stopped and turned on him . Look here , you fool , I cried . I tell you I am not Sam Fisher . Cant you understand that you have got hold of the wrong man ? My name is Burns--Burns .  He expectorated--scornfully this time . He was a man slow by nature to receive ideas , but slower to rid himself of one that had contrived to force its way into what he probably called his brain . He had decided on the evidence that I was Smooth Sam Fisher , and no denials on my part were going to shake his belief . He looked on them merely as so many unsportsmanlike quibbles prompted by greed .  Tell it to Sweeney! was the form in which he crystallized his scepticism .  May be youll say youse aint trailin de Nugget , huh ?  It was a home-thrust . If truth-telling has become a habit , one gets slowly off the mark when the moment arrives for the prudent lie . Quite against my will , I hesitated . Observant Mr MacGinnis perceived my hesitation and expectorated triumphantly .  Ah ghee! he remarked . And then with a sudden return to ferocity , All right , you Sam , you wait! Well fix you , and fix you good! See ? Dat goes . You tink youse kin put it across us , huh ? All right , youll get yours . You wait!  And with these words he slid off into the night . From somewhere in the murky middle distance came a scornful Hawg! and he was gone , leaving me with a settled conviction that , while I had frequently had occasion , since my expedition to Sanstead began , to describe affairs as complex , their complexity had now reached its height . With a watchful Pinkertons man within , and a vengeful gang of rivals without , Sanstead House seemed likely to become an unrestful place for a young kidnapper with no previous experience .  The need for swift action had become imperative .   II  White , the butler , looking singularly unlike a detective--which , I suppose , is how a detective wants to look--was taking the air on the football field when I left the house next morning for a before-breakfast stroll . The sight of him filled me with a desire for first-hand information on the subject of the man Mr MacGinnis supposed me to be and also of Mr MacGinnis himself . I wanted to be assured that my friend Buck , despite appearances , was a placid person whose bark was worse than his bite .  Whites manner , at our first conversational exchanges , was entirely that of the butler . From what I came to know of him later , I think he took an artistic pride in throwing himself into whatever role he had to assume .  At the mention of Smooth Sam Fisher , however , his manner peeled off him like a skin , and he began to talk as himself , a racy and vigorous self vastly different from the episcopal person he thought it necessary to be when on duty .  White , I said , do you know anything of Smooth Sam Fisher ?  He stared at me . I suppose the question , led up to by no previous remark , was unusual .  I met a gentleman of the name of Buck MacGinnis--he was our visitor that night , by the way--and he was full of Sam . Do you know him ?  Buck ?  Either of them .  Well , Ive never seen Buck , but I know all about him . Theres pepper to Buck .  So I should imagine . And Sam ?  You may take it from me that theres more pepper to Sams little finger than there is to Bucks whole body . Sam could make Buck look like the last run of shad , if it came to a showdown . Bucks just a common roughneck . Sams an educated man . Hes got brains .  So I gathered . Well , Im glad to hear you speak so well of him , because thats who Im supposed to be .  Hows that ?  Buck MacGinnis insists that I am Smooth Sam Fisher . Nothing I can say will shift him .  White stared . He had very bright humorous brown eyes . Then he began to laugh .  Well , what do you know about that ? he exclaimed . Wouldnt that jar you!  It would . I may say it did . He called me a hog for wanting to keep the Little Nugget to myself , and left threatening to fix me . What would you say the verb to fix signified in Mr MacGinniss vocabulary ?  White was still chuckling quietly to himself .  Hes a wonder! he observed . Can you beat it ? Taking you for Smooth Sam!  He said he had never seen Smooth Sam . Have you ?  Lord , yes .  Does he look like me ?  Not a bit .  Do you think hes over here in England ?  Sam ? I know he is .  Then Buck MacGinnis was right ?  Dead right , as far as Sam being on the trail goes . Sams after the Nugget to get him this time . Hes tried often enough before , but weve been too smart for him . This time he allows hes going to bring it off .  Then why havent we seen anything of him ? Buck MacGinnis seems to be monopolizing the kidnapping industry in these parts .  Oh , Samll show up when he feels good and ready . You can take it from me that Sam knows what he is doing . Sams a special pet of mine . I dont give a flip for Buck MacGinnis .  I wish I had your cheery disposition! To me Buck MacGinnis seems a pretty important citizen . I wonder what he meant by fix ?  White , however , declined to leave the subject of Bucks more gifted rival .  Sams a college man , you know . That gives him a pull . He has brains , and can use them .  That was one of the points on which Buck MacGinnis reproached me . He said it was not fair to use my superior education .  He laughed .  Bucks got no sense . Thats why you find him carrying on like a porch-climber . Its his only notion of how to behave when he wants to do a job . And thats why theres only one man to keep your eye on in this thing of the Little Nugget , and thats Sam . I wish you could get to know Sam . Youd like him .  You seem to look on him as a personal friend . I certainly dont like Buck .  Oh , Buck! said White scornfully .  We turned towards the house as the sound of the bell came to us across the field .  Then you think we may count on Sams arrival , sooner or later , as a certainty ? I said .  Surest thing you know .  You will have a busy time .  All in the days work .  I suppose I ought to look at it in that way . But I do wish I knew exactly what Buck meant by fix .  White at last condescended to give his mind to the trivial point .  I guess hell try to put one over on you with a sand-bag , he said carelessly . He seemed to face the prospect with calm .  A sand-bag , eh ? I said . It sounds exciting .  And feels it . I know . Ive had some .  I parted from him at the door . As a comforter he had failed to qualify . He had not eased my mind to the slightest extent .     Chapter 7   Looking at it now I can see that the days which followed Audreys arrival at Sanstead marked the true beginning of our acquaintanceship . Before , during our engagement , we had been strangers , artificially tied together , and she had struggled against the chain . But now , for the first time , we were beginning to know each other , and were discovering that , after all , we had much in common .  It did not alarm me , this growing feeling of comradeship . Keenly on the alert as I was for the least sign that would show that I was in danger of weakening in my loyalty to Cynthia , I did not detect one in my friendliness for Audrey . On the contrary , I was hugely relieved , for it seemed to me that the danger was past . I had not imagined it possible that I could ever experience towards her such a tranquil emotion as this easy friendliness . For the last five years my imagination had been playing round her memory , until I suppose I had built up in my mind some almost superhuman image , some goddess . What I was passing through now , of course , though I was unaware of it , was the natural reaction from that state of mind . Instead of the goddess , I had found a companionable human being , and I imagined that I had effected the change myself , and by sheer force of will brought Audrey into a reasonable relation to the scheme of things .  I suppose a not too intelligent moth has much the same views with regard to the lamp . His last thought , as he enters the flame , is probably one of self-congratulation that he has arranged his dealings with it on such a satisfactory commonsense basis .  And then , when I was feeling particularly safe and complacent , disaster came .  The day was Wednesday , and my afternoon off , but the rain was driving against the windows , and the attractions of billiards with the marker at the Feathers had not proved sufficient to make me face the two-mile walk in the storm . I had settled myself in the study . There was a noble fire burning in the grate , and the darkness lit by the glow of the coals , the dripping of the rain , the good behaviour of my pipe , and the reflection that , as I sat there , Glossop was engaged downstairs in wrestling with my class , combined to steep me in a meditative peace . Audrey was playing the piano in the drawing-room . The sound came to me faintly through the closed doors . I recognized what she was playing . I wondered if the melody had the same associations for her that it had for me .  The music stopped . I heard the drawing-room door open . She came into the study .  I didnt know there was anyone here , she said . Im frozen . The drawing-room fires out .  Come and sit down , I said . You dont mind the smoke ?  I drew a chair up to the fire for her , feeling , as I did so , a certain pride . Here I was , alone with her in the firelight , and my pulse was regular and my brain cool . I had a momentary vision of myself as the Strong Man , the strong , quiet man with the iron grip on his emotions . I was pleased with myself .  She sat for some minutes , gazing into the fire . Little spurts of flame whistled comfortably in the heart of the black-red coals . Outside the storm shrieked faintly , and flurries of rain dashed themselves against the window .  Its very nice in here , she said at last .  Peaceful .  I filled my pipe and re-lit it . Her eyes , seen for an instant in the light of the match , looked dreamy .  Ive been sitting here listening to you , I said . I liked that last thing you played .  You always did .  You remember that ? Do you remember one evening--no , you wouldnt .  Which evening ?  Oh , you wouldnt remember . Its only one particular evening when you played that thing . It sticks in my mind . It was at your fathers studio .  She looked up quickly .  We went out afterwards and sat in the park .  I sat up thrilled .  A man came by with a dog , I said .  Two dogs .  One surely!  Two . A bull-dog and a fox-terrier .  I remember the bull-dog , but--by Jove , youre right . A fox-terrier with a black patch over his left eye .  Right eye .  Right eye . They came up to us , and you--  Gave them chocolates .  I sank back slowly in my chair .  Youve got a wonderful memory , I said .  She bent over the fire without speaking . The rain rattled on the window .  So you still like my playing , Peter ?  I like it better than ever; theres something in it now that I dont believe there used to be . I cant describe it--something--  I think its knowledge , Peter , she said quietly . Experience . Im five years older than I was when I used to play to you before , and Ive seen a good deal in those five years . It may not be altogether pleasant seeing life , but--well , it makes you play the piano better . Experience goes in at the heart and comes out at the finger-tips .  It seemed to me that she spoke a little bitterly .  Have you had a bad time , Audrey , these last years ? I said .  Pretty bad .  Im sorry .  Im not--altogether . Ive learned a lot .  She was silent again , her eyes fixed on the fire .  What are you thinking about ? I said .  Oh , a great many things .  Pleasant ?  Mixed . The last thing I thought about was pleasant . That was , that I am very lucky to be doing the work I am doing now . Compared with some of the things I have done--  She shivered .  I wish you would tell me about those years , Audrey , I said . What were some of the things you did ?  She leaned back in her chair and shaded her face from the fire with a newspaper . Her eyes were in the shadow .  Well , let me see . I was a nurse for some time at the Lafayette Hospital in New York .  Thats hard work ?  Horribly hard . I had to give it up after a while . But--it teaches you . . . . You learn . . . . You learn--all sorts of things . Realities . How much of your own trouble is imagination . You get real trouble in a hospital . You get it thrown at you .  I said nothing . I was feeling--I dont know why--a little uncomfortable , a little at a disadvantage , as one feels in the presence of some one bigger than oneself .  Then I was a waitress .  A waitress ?  I tell you I did everything . I was a waitress , and a very bad one . I broke plates . I muddled orders . Finally I was very rude to a customer and I went on to try something else . I forget what came next . I think it was the stage . I travelled for a year with a touring company . That was hard work , too , but I liked it . After that came dressmaking , which was harder and which I hated . And then I had my first stroke of real luck .  What was that ?  I met Mr Ford .  How did that happen ?  You wouldnt remember a Miss Vanderley , an American girl who was over in London five or six years ago ? My father taught her painting . She was very rich , but she was wild at that time to be Bohemian . I think thats why she chose Father as a teacher . Well , she was always at the studio , and we became great friends , and one day , after all these things I have been telling you of , I thought I would write to her , and see if she could not find me something to do . She was a dear . Her voice trembled , and she lowered the newspaper till her whole face was hidden . She wanted me to come to their home and live on her for ever , but I couldnt have that . I told her I must work . So she sent me to Mr Ford , whom the Vanderleys knew very well , and I became Ogdens governess .  Great Scott! I cried . What!  She laughed rather shakily .  I dont think I was a very good governess . I knew next to nothing . I ought to have been having a governess myself . But I managed somehow .  But Ogden ? I said . That little fiend , didnt he worry the life out of you ?  Oh , I had luck there again . He happened to take a mild liking to me , and he was as good as gold--for him; thats to say , if I didnt interfere with him too much , and I didnt . I was horribly weak; he let me alone . It was the happiest time I had had for ages .  And when he came here , you came too , as a sort of ex-governess , to continue exerting your moral influence over him ?  She laughed .  More or less that .  We sat in silence for a while , and then she put into words the thought which was in both our minds .  How odd it seems , you and I sitting together chatting like this , Peter , after all--all these years .  Like a dream!  Just like a dream  . . . Im so glad . . . . You dont know how Ive hated myself sometimes for--for--  Audrey! You mustnt talk like that . Dont lets think of it . Besides , it was my fault .  She shook her head .  Well , put it that we didnt understand one another .  She nodded slowly .  No , we didnt understand one another .  But we do now , I said . Were friends , Audrey .  She did not answer . For a long time we sat in silence . And then the newspaper must have moved--a gleam from the fire fell upon her face , lighting up her eyes; and at the sight something in me began to throb , like a drum warning a city against danger . The next moment the shadow had covered them again .  I sat there , tense , gripping the arms of my chair . I was tingling . Something was happening to me . I had a curious sensation of being on the threshold of something wonderful and perilous .  From downstairs there came the sound of boys voices . Work was over , and with it this talk by the firelight . In a few minutes somebody , Glossop , or Mr Abney , would be breaking in on our retreat .  We both rose , and then--it happened . She must have tripped in the darkness . She stumbled forward , her hand caught at my coat , and she was in my arms .  It was a thing of an instant . She recovered herself , moved to the door , and was gone .  But I stood where I was , motionless , aghast at the revelation which had come to me in that brief moment . It was the physical contact , the feel of her , warm and alive , that had shattered for ever that flimsy structure of friendship which I had fancied so strong . I had said to Love , Thus far , and no farther , and Love had swept over me , the more powerful for being checked . The time of self-deception was over . I knew myself .     Chapter 8   I  That Buck MacGinnis was not the man to let the grass grow under his feet in a situation like the present one , I would have gathered from Whites remarks if I had not already done so from personal observation . The world is divided into dreamers and men of action . From what little I had seen of him I placed Buck MacGinnis in the latter class . Every day I expected him to act , and was agreeably surprised as each twenty-four hours passed and left me still unfixed . But I knew the hour would come , and it did .  I looked for frontal attack from Buck , not subtlety; but , when the attack came , it was so excessively frontal that my chief emotion was a sort of paralysed amazement . It seemed incredible that such peculiarly Wild Western events could happen in peaceful England , even in so isolated a spot as Sanstead House .  It had been one of those interminable days which occur only at schools . A school , more than any other institution , is dependent on the weather . Every small boy rises from his bed of a morning charged with a definite quantity of devilry; and this , if he is to sleep the sound sleep of health , he has got to work off somehow before bedtime . That is why the summer term is the one a master longs for , when the intervals between classes can be spent in the open . There is no pleasanter sight for an assistant-master at a private school than that of a number of boys expending their venom harmlessly in the sunshine .  On this particular day , snow had begun to fall early in the morning , and , while his pupils would have been only too delighted to go out and roll in it by the hour , they were prevented from doing so by Mr Abneys strict orders . No schoolmaster enjoys seeing his pupils running risks of catching cold , and just then Mr Abney was especially definite on the subject . The Saturnalia which had followed Mr MacGinnis nocturnal visit to the school had had the effect of giving violent colds to three lords , a baronet , and the younger son of an honourable . And , in addition to that , Mr Abney himself , his penetrating tenor changed to a guttural croak , was in his bed looking on the world with watering eyes . His views , therefore , on playing in the snow as an occupation for boys were naturally prejudiced .  The result was that Glossop and I had to try and keep order among a mob of small boys , none of whom had had any chance of working off his superfluous energy . How Glossop fared I can only imagine . Judging by the fact that I , who usually kept fair order without excessive effort , was almost overwhelmed , I should fancy he fared badly . His classroom was on the opposite side of the hall from mine , and at frequent intervals his voice would penetrate my door , raised to a frenzied fortissimo .  Little by little , however , we had won through the day , and the boys had subsided into comparative quiet over their evening preparation , when from outside the front door there sounded the purring of the engine of a large automobile . The bell rang .  I did not , I remember , pay much attention to this at the moment . I supposed that somebody from one of the big houses in the neighbourhood had called , or , taking the lateness of the hour into consideration , that a motoring party had come , as they did sometimes--Sanstead House standing some miles from anywhere in the middle of an intricate system of by-roads--to inquire the way to Portsmouth or London . If my class had allowed me , I would have ignored the sound . But for them it supplied just that break in the monotony of things which they had needed . They welcomed it vociferously .  A voice: Sir , please , sir , theres a motor outside .  Myself (austerely): I know theres a motor outside . Get on with your work .  Various voices: Sir , have you ever ridden in a motor ?  Sir , my father let me help drive our motor last Easter , sir .  Sir , who do you think it is ?  An isolated genius (imitating the engine): Pr-prr! Pr-prr! Pr-prr!  I was on the point of distributing bad marks (the schoolmasters stand-by) broadcast , when a curious sound checked me . It followed directly upon the opening of the front door . I heard Whites footsteps crossing the hall , then the click of the latch , and then--a sound that I could not define . The closed door of the classroom deadened it , but for all that it was audible . It resembled the thud of a falling body , but I knew it could not be that , for in peaceful England butlers opening front doors did not fall with thuds .  My class , eager listeners , found fresh material in the sound for friendly conversation .  Sir , what was that , sir ?  Did you hear that , sir ?  What do you thinks happened , sir ?  Be quiet , I shouted . Will you be--  There was a quick footstep outside , the door flew open , and on the threshold stood a short , sturdy man in a motoring coat and cap . The upper part of his face was covered by a strip of white linen , with holes for the eyes , and there was a Browning pistol in his hand .  It is my belief that , if assistant-masters were allowed to wear white masks and carry automatic pistols , keeping order in a school would become childs play . A silence such as no threat of bad marks had ever been able to produce fell instantaneously upon the classroom . Out of the corner of my eye , as I turned to face our visitor , I could see small boys goggling rapturously at this miraculous realization of all the dreams induced by juvenile adventure fiction . As far as I could ascertain , on subsequent inquiry , not one of them felt a tremor of fear . It was all too tremendously exciting for that . For their exclusive benefit an illustration from a weekly paper for boys had come to life , and they had no time to waste in being frightened .  As for me , I was dazed . Motor bandits may terrorize France , and desperadoes hold up trains in America , but this was peaceful England . The fact that Buck MacGinnis was at large in the neighbourhood did not make the thing any the less incredible . I had looked on my affair with Buck as a thing of the open air and the darkness . I had figured him lying in wait in lonely roads , possibly , even , lurking about the grounds; but in my most apprehensive moments I had not imagined him calling at the front door and holding me up with a revolver in my own classroom .  And yet it was the simple , even the obvious , thing for him to do . Given an automobile , success was certain . Sanstead House stood absolutely alone . There was not even a cottage within half a mile . A train broken down in the middle of the Bad Lands was not more cut off .  Consider , too , the peculiar helplessness of a school in such a case . A school lives on the confidence of parents , a nebulous foundation which the slightest breath can destroy . Everything connected with it must be done with exaggerated discretion . I do not suppose Mr MacGinnis had thought the thing out in all its bearings , but he could not have made a sounder move if he had been a Napoleon . Where the owner of an ordinary country-house raided by masked men can raise the countryside in pursuit , a schoolmaster must do precisely the opposite . From his point of view , the fewer people that know of the affair the better . Parents are a jumpy race . A man may be the ideal schoolmaster , yet will a connection with melodrama damn him in the eyes of parents . They do not inquire . They are too panic-stricken for that . Golden-haired Willie may be receiving the finest education conceivable , yet if men with Browning pistols are familiar objects at his shrine of learning they will remove him . Fortunately for schoolmasters it is seldom that such visitors call upon them . Indeed , I imagine Mr MacGinniss effort to have been the first of its kind .  I do not , as I say , suppose that Buck , whose forte was action rather than brain-work , had thought all this out . He had trusted to luck , and luck had stood by him . There would be no raising of the countryside in his case . On the contrary , I could see Mr Abney becoming one of the busiest persons on record in his endeavour to hush the thing up and prevent it getting into the papers . The man with the pistol spoke . He sighted me--I was standing with my back to the mantelpiece , parallel with the door--made a sharp turn , and raised his weapon .  Put em up , sport , he said .  It was not the voice of Buck MacGinnis . I put my hands up .  Say , which of dese is de Nugget ?  He half turned his head to the class .  Which of youse kids is Ogden Ford ?  The class was beyond speech . The silence continued .  Ogden Ford is not here , I said .  Our visitor had not that simple faith which is so much better than Norman blood . He did not believe me . Without moving his head he gave a long whistle . Steps sounded outside . Another , short , sturdy form , entered the room .  He aint in de odder room , observed the newcomer . I been rubberin!  This was friend Buck beyond question . I could have recognized his voice anywhere!  Well dis guy , said the man with the pistol , indicating me , says he aint here . Whats de answer ?  Why , its Sam! said Buck . Howdy , Sam ? Pleased to see us , huh ? Were in on de ground floor , too , dis time , all right , all right .  His words had a marked effect on his colleague .  Is dat Sam ? Hell! Let me blow de head offn him! he said , with simple fervour; and , advancing a step nearer , he waved his disengaged fist truculently . In my role of Sam I had plainly made myself very unpopular . I have never heard so much emotion packed into a few words .  Buck , to my relief , opposed the motion . I thought this decent of Buck .  Cheese it , he said curtly .  The other cheesed it . The operation took the form of lowering the fist . The pistol he kept in position .  Mr MacGinnis resumed the conduct of affairs .  Now den , Sam , he said , come across! Wheres de Nugget ?  My name is not Sam , I said . May I put my hands down ?  Yep , if you want the top of your damn head blown off .  Such was not my desire . I kept them up .  Now den , you Sam , said Mr MacGinnis again , we aint got time to burn . Out with it . Wheres dat Nugget ?  Some reply was obviously required . It was useless to keep protesting that I was not Sam .  At this time in the evening he is generally working with Mr Glossop .  Whos Glossop ? Dat dough-faced dub in de room over dere ?  Exactly . You have described him perfectly .  Well , he aint dere . I bin rubberin . Aw , quit yer foolin , Sam , where is he ?  I couldnt tell you just where he is at the present moment , I said precisely .  Ahr chee! Let me swot him one! begged the man with the pistol; a most unlovable person . I could never have made a friend of him .  Cheese it , you! said Mr MacGinnis .  The other cheesed it once more , regretfully .  You got him hidden away somewheres , Sam , said Mr MacGinnis . You cant fool me . Im com troo dis joint wit a fine-tooth comb till I find him .  By all means , I said . Dont let me stop you .  You ? Youre coming wit me .  If you wish it . I shall be delighted .  An cut out dat dam sissy way of talking , you rummy , bellowed Buck , with a sudden lapse into ferocity . Spiel like a regular guy! Standin dere , pullin dat dude stuff on me! Cut it out!  Say , why maynt I hand him one ? demanded the pistol-bearer pathetically . Whats your kick against pushin his face in ?  I thought the question in poor taste . Buck ignored it .  Gimme dat canister , he said , taking the Browning pistol from him . Now den , Sam , are youse goin to be good , and come across , or aint you--which ?  Id be delighted to do anything you wished , Mr MacGinnis , I said , but--  Aw , hire a hall! said Buck disgustedly . Step lively , den , an well go troo de joint . I tought youse ud have had more sense , Sam , dan to play dis fool game when you know youre beat . You--  Shooting pains in my shoulders caused me to interrupt him .  One moment , I said . Im going to put my hands down . Im getting cramp .  Ill blow a hole in you if you do!  Just as you please . But Im not armed .  Lefty , he said to the other man , feel around to see if hes carryin anyting .  Lefty advanced and began to tap me scientifically in the neighbourhood of my pockets . He grunted morosely the while . I suppose , at this close range , the temptation to hand me one was almost more than he could bear .  He aint got no gun , he announced gloomily .  Den youse can put em down , said Mr MacGinnis .  Thanks , I said .  Lefty , youse stay here and look after dese kids . Get a move on , Sam .  We left the room , a little procession of two , myself leading , Buck in my immediate rear administering occasional cautionary prods with the faithful canister .   II  The first thing that met my eyes as we entered the hall was the body of a man lying by the front door . The light of the lamp fell on his face and I saw that it was White . His hands and feet were tied . As I looked at him , he moved , as if straining against his bonds , and I was conscious of a feeling of relief . That sound that had reached me in the classroom , that thud of a falling body , had become , in the light of what had happened later , very sinister . It was good to know that he was still alive . I gathered--correctly , as I discovered subsequently--that in his case the sand-bag had been utilized . He had been struck down and stunned the instant he opened the door .  There was a masked man leaning against the wall by Glossops classroom . He was short and sturdy . The Buck MacGinnis gang seemed to have been turned out on a pattern . Externally , they might all have been twins . This man , to give him a semblance of individuality , had a ragged red moustache . He was smoking a cigar with the air of the warrior taking his rest .  Hello! he said , as we appeared . He jerked a thumb towards the classroom . Ive locked dem in . Whats doin , Buck ? he asked , indicating me with a languid nod .  Were going troo de joint , explained Mr MacGinnis . De kid aint in dere . Hump yourself , Sam!  His colleagues languor disappeared with magic swiftness .  Sam! Is dat Sam ? Here , let me beat de block offn him!  Few points in this episode struck me as more remarkable than the similarity of taste which prevailed , as concerned myself , among the members of Mr MacGinniss gang . Men , doubtless of varying opinions on other subjects , on this one point they were unanimous . They all wanted to assault me .  Buck , however , had other uses for me . For the present , I was necessary as a guide , and my value as such would be impaired were the block to be beaten off me . Though feeling no friendlier towards me than did his assistants , he declined to allow sentiment to interfere with business . He concentrated his attention on the upward journey with all the earnestness of the young gentleman who carried the banner with the strange device in the poem .  Briefly requesting his ally to cheese it--which he did--he urged me on with the nozzle of the pistol . The red-moustached man sank back against the wall again with an air of dejection , sucking his cigar now like one who has had disappointments in life , while we passed on up the stairs and began to draw the rooms on the first floor .  These consisted of Mr Abneys study and two dormitories . The study was empty , and the only occupants of the dormitories were the three boys who had been stricken down with colds on the occasion of Mr MacGinniss last visit . They squeaked with surprise at the sight of the assistant-master in such questionable company .  Buck eyed them disappointedly . I waited with something of the feelings of a drummer taking a buyer round the sample room .  Get on , said Buck .  Wont one of those do ?  Hump yourself , Sam .  Call me Sammy , I urged . Were old friends now .  Dont get fresh , he said austerely . And we moved on .  The top floor was even more deserted than the first . There was no one in the dormitories . The only other room was Mr Abneys; and , as we came opposite it , a sneeze from within told of the sufferings of its occupant .  The sound stirred Buck to his depths . He pointed at the door like a smell-dog .  Whos in dere ? he demanded .  Only Mr Abney . Better not disturb him . He has a bad cold .  He placed a wrong construction on my solicitude for my employer . His manner became excited .  Open dat door , you , he cried .  Itll give him a nasty shock .  Gwan! Open it!  No one who is digging a Browning pistol into the small of my back will ever find me disobliging . I opened the door--knocking first , as a mild concession to the conventions--and the procession passed in .  My stricken employer was lying on his back , staring at the ceiling , and our entrance did not at first cause him to change this position .  Yes ? he said thickly , and disappeared beneath a huge pocket-handkerchief . Muffled sounds , as of distant explosions of dynamite , together with earthquake shudderings of the bedclothes , told of another sneezing-fit .  Im sorry to disturb you , I began , when Buck , ever the man of action , with a scorn of palaver , strode past me , and , having prodded with the pistol that part of the bedclothes beneath which a rough calculation suggested that Mr Abneys lower ribs were concealed , uttered the one word , Sa-a-ay!  Mr Abney sat up like a Jack-in-the-box . One might almost say that he shot up . And then he saw Buck .  I cannot even faintly imagine what were Mr Abneys emotions at that moment . He was a man who , from boyhood up , had led a quiet and regular life . Things like Buck had appeared to him hitherto , if they appeared at all , only in dreams after injudicious suppers . Even in the ordinary costume of the Bowery gentleman , without such adventitious extras as masks and pistols , Buck was no beauty . With that hideous strip of dingy white linen on his face , he was a walking nightmare .  Mr Abneys eyebrows had risen and his jaw had fallen to their uttermost limits . His hair , disturbed by contact with the pillow , gave the impression of standing on end . His eyes seemed to bulge like a snails . He stared at Buck , fascinated .  Say , you , quit rubberin . Youse aint in a dime museum . Wheres dat Ford kid , huh ?  I have set down all Mr MacGinniss remarks as if they had been uttered in a bell-like voice with a clear and crisp enunciation; but , in doing so , I have flattered him . In reality , his mode of speech suggested that he had something large and unwieldy permanently stuck in his mouth; and it was not easy for a stranger to follow him . Mr Abney signally failed to do so . He continued to gape helplessly till the tension was broken by a sneeze .  One cannot interrogate a sneezing man with any satisfaction to oneself . Buck stood by the bedside in moody silence , waiting for the paroxysm to spend itself .  I , meanwhile , had remained where I stood , close to the door . And , as I waited for Mr Abney to finish sneezing , for the first time since Bucks colleague Lefty had entered the classroom the idea of action occurred to me . Until this moment , I suppose , the strangeness and unexpectedness of these happenings had numbed my brain . To precede Buck meekly upstairs and to wait with equal meekness while he interviewed Mr Abney had seemed the only course open to me . To one whose life has lain apart from such things , the hypnotic influence of a Browning pistol is irresistible .  But now , freed temporarily from this influence , I began to think; and , my mind making up for its previous inaction by working with unwonted swiftness , I formed a plan of action at once .  It was simple , but I had an idea that it would be effective . My strength lay in my acquaintance with the geography of Sanstead House and Bucks ignorance of it . Let me but get an adequate start , and he might find pursuit vain . It was this start which I saw my way to achieving .  To Buck it had not yet occurred that it was a tactical error to leave me between the door and himself . I supposed he relied too implicitly on the mesmeric pistol . He was not even looking at me .  The next moment my fingers were on the switch of the electric light , and the room was in darkness .  There was a chair by the door . I seized it and swung it into the space between us . Then , springing back , I banged the door and ran .  I did not run without a goal in view . My objective was the study . This , as I have explained , was on the first floor . Its window looked out on to a strip of lawn at the side of the house ending in a shrubbery . The drop would not be pleasant , but I seemed to remember a waterspout that ran up the wall close to the window , and , in any case , I was not in a position to be deterred by the prospect of a bruise or two . I had not failed to realize that my position was one of extreme peril . When Buck , concluding the tour of the house , found that the Little Nugget was not there--as I had reason to know that he would--there was no room for doubt that he would withdraw the protection which he had extended to me up to the present in my capacity of guide . On me the disappointed fury of the raiders would fall . No prudent consideration for their own safety would restrain them . If ever the future was revealed to man , I saw mine . My only chance was to get out into the grounds , where the darkness would make pursuit an impossibility .  It was an affair which must be settled one way or the other in a few seconds , and I calculated that it would take Buck just those few seconds to win his way past the chair and find the door-handle .  I was right . Just as I reached the study , the door of the bedroom flew open , and the house rang with shouts and the noise of feet on the uncarpeted landing . From the hall below came answering shouts , but with an interrogatory note in them . The assistants were willing , but puzzled . They did not like to leave their posts without specific instructions , and Buck , shouting as he clattered over the bare boards , was unintelligible .  I was in the study , the door locked behind me , before they could arrive at an understanding . I sprang to the window .  The handle rattled . Voices shouted . A panel splintered beneath a kick , and the door shook on its hinges .  And then , for the first time , I think , in my life , panic gripped me , the sheer , blind fear which destroys the reason . It swept over me in a wave , that numbing terror which comes to one in dreams . Indeed , the thing had become dream-like . I seemed to be standing outside myself , looking on at myself , watching myself heave and strain with bruised fingers at a window that would not open .   III  The arm-chair critic , reviewing a situation calmly and at his ease , is apt to make too small allowances for the effect of hurry and excitement on the human mind . He is cool and detached . He sees exactly what ought to have been done , and by what simple means catastrophe might have been averted .  He would have made short work of my present difficulty , I feel certain . It was ridiculously simple . But I had lost my head , and had ceased for the moment to be a reasoning creature . In the end , indeed , it was no presence of mind but pure good luck which saved me . Just as the door , which had held out gallantly , gave way beneath the attack from outside , my fingers , slipping , struck against the catch of the window , and I understood why I had failed to raise it .  I snapped the catch back , and flung up the sash . An icy wind swept into the room , bearing particles of snow . I scrambled on to the window-sill , and a crash from behind me told of the falling of the door .  The packed snow on the sill was drenching my knees as I worked my way out and prepared to drop . There was a deafening explosion inside the room , and simultaneously something seared my shoulder like a hot iron . I cried out with the pain of it , and , losing my balance , fell from the sill .  There was , fortunately for me , a laurel bush immediately below the window , or I should have been undone . I fell into it , all arms and legs , in a way which would have meant broken bones if I had struck the hard turf . I was on my feet in an instant , shaken and scratched and , incidentally , in a worse temper than ever in my life before . The idea of flight , which had obsessed me a moment before , to the exclusion of all other mundane affairs , had vanished absolutely . I was full of fight , I might say overflowing with it . I remember standing there , with the snow trickling in chilly rivulets down my face and neck , and shaking my fist at the window . Two of my pursuers were leaning out of it , while a third dodged behind them , like a small man on the outskirts of a crowd . So far from being thankful for my escape , I was conscious only of a feeling of regret that there was no immediate way of getting at them .  They made no move towards travelling the quick but trying route which had commended itself to me . They seemed to be waiting for something to happen . It was not long before I was made aware of what this something was . From the direction of the front door came the sound of one running . A sudden diminution of the noise of his feet told me that he had left the gravel and was on the turf . I drew back a pace or two and waited .  It was pitch dark , and I had no fear that I should be seen . I was standing well outside the light from the window .  The man stopped just in front of me . A short parley followed .  Cantja see him ?  The voice was not Bucks . It was Buck who answered . And when I realized that this man in front of me , within easy reach , on whose back I was shortly about to spring , and whose neck I proposed , under Providence , to twist into the shape of a corkscrew , was no mere underling , but Mr MacGinnis himself , I was filled with a joy which I found it hard to contain in silence .  Looking back , I am a little sorry for Mr MacGinnis . He was not a good man . His mode of speech was not pleasant , and his manners were worse than his speech . But , though he undoubtedly deserved all that was coming to him , it was nevertheless bad luck for him to be standing just there at just that moment . The reactions after my panic , added to the pain of my shoulder , the scratches on my face , and the general misery of being wet and cold , had given me a reckless fury and a determination to do somebody , whoever happened to come along , grievous bodily hurt , such as seldom invades the bosoms of the normally peaceful . To put it crisply , I was fighting mad , and I looked on Buck as something sent by Heaven .  He had got as far , in his reply , as Naw , I cant-- when I sprang .  I have read of the spring of the jaguar , and I have seen some very creditable flying-tackles made on the football field . My leap combined the outstanding qualities of both . I connected with Mr MacGinnis in the region of the waist , and the howl he gave as we crashed to the ground was music to my ears .  But how true is the old Roman saying , Surgit amari aliquid . Our pleasures are never perfect . There is always something . In the programme which I had hastily mapped out , the upsetting of Mr MacGinnis was but a small item , a mere preliminary . There were a number of things which I had wished to do to him , once upset . But it was not to be . Even as I reached for his throat I perceived that the light of the window was undergoing an eclipse . A compact form had wriggled out on to the sill , as I had done , and I heard the grating of his shoes on the wall as he lowered himself for the drop .  There is a moment when the pleasantest functions must come to an end . I was loath to part from Mr MacGinnis just when I was beginning , as it were , to do myself justice; but it was unavoidable . In another moment his ally would descend upon us , like some Homeric god swooping from a cloud , and I was not prepared to continue the battle against odds .  I disengaged myself--Mr MacGinnis strangely quiescent during the process--and was on my feet in the safety of the darkness just as the reinforcement touched earth . This time I did not wait . My hunger for fight had been appeased to some extent by my brush with Buck , and I was satisfied to have achieved safety with honour .  Making a wide detour I crossed the drive and worked my way through the bushes to within a few yards of where the automobile stood , filling the night with the soft purring of its engines . I was interested to see what would be the enemys next move . It was improbable that they would attempt to draw the grounds in search of me . I imagined that they would recognize failure and retire whence they had come .  I was right . I had not been watching long , before a little group advanced into the light of the automobiles lamps . There were four of them . Three were walking , the fourth , cursing with the vigour and breadth that marks the expert , lying on their arms , of which they had made something resembling a stretcher .  The driver of the car , who had been sitting woodenly in his seat , turned at the sound .  Ja get him ? he inquired .  Get nothing! replied one of the three moodily . De Nugget aint dere , an we was chasin Sam to fix him , an he laid for us , an what he did to Buck was plenty .  They placed their valuable burden in the tonneau , where he lay repeating himself , and two of them climbed in after him . The third seated himself beside the driver .  Bucks legs broke , he announced .  Hell! said the chauffeur .  No young actor , receiving his first round of applause , could have felt a keener thrill of gratification than I did at those words . Life may have nobler triumphs than the breaking of a kidnappers leg , but I did not think so then . It was with an effort that I stopped myself from cheering .  Let her go , said the man in the front seat .  The purring rose to a roar . The car turned and began to move with increasing speed down the drive . Its drone grew fainter , and ceased . I brushed the snow from my coat and walked to the front door .  My first act on entering the house , was to release White . He was still lying where I had seen him last . He appeared to have made no headway with the cords on his wrists and ankles . I came to his help with a rather blunt pocket-knife , and he rose stiffly and began to chafe the injured arms in silence .  Theyve gone , I said .  He nodded .  Did they hit you with a sand-bag ?  He nodded again .  I broke Bucks leg , I said , with modest pride .  He looked up incredulously . I related my experiences as briefly as possible , and when I came to the part where I made my flying tackle , the gloom was swept from his face by a joyful smile . Bucks injury may have given its recipient pain , but it was certainly the cause of pleasure to others . Whites manner was one of the utmost enthusiasm as I described the scene .  Thatll hold Buck for a while , was his comment . I guess we shant hear from him for a week or two . Thats the best cure for the headache Ive ever struck .  He rubbed the lump that just showed beneath his hair . I did not wonder at his emotion . Whoever had wielded the sand-bag had done his work well , in a manner to cause hard feelings on the part of the victim .  I had been vaguely conscious during this conversation of an intermittent noise like distant thunder . I now perceived that it came from Glossops classroom , and was caused by the beating of hands on the door-panels . I remembered that the red-moustached man had locked Glossop and his young charges in . It seemed to me that he had done well . There would be plenty of confusion without their assistance .  I was turning towards my own classroom when I saw Audrey on the stairs and went to meet her .  Its all right , I said . Theyve gone .  Who was it ? What did they want ?  It was a gentleman named MacGinnis and some friends . They came after Ogden Ford , but they didnt get him .  Where is he ? Where is Ogden ?  Before I could reply , babel broke loose . While we had been talking , White had injudiciously turned the key of Glossops classroom which now disgorged its occupants , headed by my colleague , in a turbulent stream . At the same moment my own classroom began to empty itself . The hall was packed with boys , and the din became deafening . Every one had something to say , and they all said it at once .  Glossop was at my side , semaphoring violently .  We must telephone , he bellowed in my ear , for the police .  Somebody tugged at my arm . It was Audrey . She was saying something which was drowned in the uproar . I drew her towards the stairs , and we found comparative quiet on the first landing .  What were you saying ? I asked .  He isnt there .  Who ?  Ogden Ford . Where is he ? He is not in his room . They must have taken him .  Glossop came up at a gallop , springing from stair to stair like the chamois of the Alps .  We must telephone for the police! he cried .  I have telephoned , said Audrey , ten minutes ago . They are sending some men at once . Mr Glossop , was Ogden Ford in your classroom ?  No , Mrs Sheridan . I thought he was with you , Burns .  I shook my head .  Those men came to kidnap him , Mr Glossop , said Audrey .  Undoubtedly the gang of scoundrels to which that man the other night belonged! This is preposterous . My nerves will not stand these repeated outrages . We must have police protection . The villains must be brought to justice . I never heard of such a thing! In an English school!  Glossops eyes gleamed agitatedly behind their spectacles . Macbeths deportment when confronted with Banquos ghost was stolid by comparison . There was no doubt that Bucks visit had upset the smooth peace of our happy little community to quite a considerable extent .  The noise in the hall had increased rather than subsided . A belated sense of professional duty returned to Glossop and myself . We descended the stairs and began to do our best , in our respective styles , to produce order . It was not an easy task . Small boys are always prone to make a noise , even without provocation . When they get a genuine excuse like the incursion of men in white masks , who prod assistant-masters in the small of the back with Browning pistols , they tend to eclipse themselves . I doubt whether we should ever have quieted them , had it not been that the hour of Bucks visit had chanced to fall within a short time of that set apart for the boys tea , and that the kitchen had lain outside the sphere of our visitors operations . As in many English country houses , the kitchen at Sanstead House was at the end of a long corridor , shut off by doors through which even pistol-shots penetrated but faintly . Our excellent cook had , moreover , the misfortune to be somewhat deaf , with the result that , throughout all the storm and stress in our part of the house , she , like the lady in Goethes poem , had gone on cutting bread and butter; till now , when it seemed that nothing could quell the uproar , there rose above it the ringing of the bell .  If there is anything exciting enough to keep the Englishman or the English boy from his tea , it has yet to be discovered . The shouting ceased on the instant . The general feeling seemed to be that inquiries could be postponed till a more suitable occasion , but not tea . There was a general movement in the direction of the dining-room .  Glossop had already gone with the crowd , and I was about to follow , when there was another ring at the front-door bell .  I gathered that this must be the police , and waited . In the impending inquiry I was by way of being a star witness . If any one had been in the thick of things from the beginning it was myself .  White opened the door . I caught a glimpse of blue uniforms , and came forward to do the honours .  There were two of them , no more . In response to our urgent appeal for assistance against armed bandits , the Majesty of the Law had materialized itself in the shape of a stout inspector and a long , lean constable . I thought , as I came to meet them , that they were fortunate to have arrived late . I could see Lefty and the red-moustached man , thwarted in their designs on me , making dreadful havoc among the official force , as here represented .  White , the simple butler once more , introduced us .  This is Mr Burns , one of the masters at the school , he said , and removed himself from the scene . There never was a man like White for knowing his place when he played the butler .  The inspector looked at me sharply . The constable gazed into space .  Hm! said the inspector .  Mentally I had named them Bones and Johnson . I do not know why , except that they seemed to deserve it .  You telephoned for us , said Bones accusingly .  We did .  Whats the trouble ? What--got your notebook ?--has been happening ?  Johnson removed his gaze from the middle distance and produced a notebook .  At about half past five-- I began .  Johnson moistened his pencil .  At about half past five an automobile drove up to the front door . In it were five masked men with revolvers .  I interested them . There was no doubt of that . Boness healthy colour deepened , and his eyes grew round . Johnsons pencil raced over the page , wobbling with emotion .  Masked men ? echoed Bones .  With revolvers , I said . Now arent you glad you didnt go to the circus ? They rang the front-door bell; when White opened it , they stunned him with a sand-bag . Then--  Bones held up a large hand .  Wait!  I waited .  Who is White ?  The butler .  I will take his statement . Fetch the butler .  Johnson trotted off obediently .  Left alone with me , Bones became friendlier and less official .  This is as queer a start as ever I heard of , Mr Burns , he said . Twenty years Ive been in the force , and nothing like this has transpired . It beats cock-fighting . What in the world do you suppose men with masks and revolvers was after ? First idea I had was that you were making fun of me .  I was shocked at the idea . I hastened to give further details .  They were a gang of American crooks who had come over to kidnap Mr Elmer Fords son , who is a pupil at the school . You have heard of Mr Ford ? He is an American millionaire , and there have been several attempts during the past few years to kidnap Ogden .  At this point Johnson returned with White . White told his story briefly , exhibited his bruise , showed the marks of the cords on his wrists , and was dismissed . I suggested that further conversation had better take place in the presence of Mr Abney , who , I imagined , would have something to say on the subject of hushing the thing up .  We went upstairs . The broken door of the study delayed us a while and led to a fresh spasm of activity on the part of Johnsons pencil . Having disposed of this , we proceeded to Mr Abneys room .  Boness authoritative rap upon the door produced an agitated Whos that ? from the occupant . I explained the nature of the visitation through the keyhole and there came from within the sound of moving furniture . His one brief interview with Buck had evidently caused my employer to ensure against a second by barricading himself in with everything he could find suitable for the purpose . It was some moments before the way was clear for our entrance .  Cub id , said a voice at last .  Mr Abney was sitting up in bed , the blankets wrapped tightly about him . His appearance was still disordered . The furniture of the room was in great confusion , and a poker on the floor by the dressing-table showed that he had been prepared to sell his life dearly .  I ab glad to see you , Idspector , he said . Bister Burds , what is the expladation of this extraordinary affair ?  It took some time to explain matters to Mr Abney , and more to convince Bones and his colleague that , so far from wanting a hue and cry raised over the countryside and columns about the affair in the papers , publicity was the thing we were anxious to avoid . They were visibly disappointed when they grasped the position of affairs . The thing , properly advertised , would have been the biggest that had ever happened to the neighbourhood , and their eager eyes could see glory within easy reach . Mention of a cold snack and a drop of beer , however , to be found in the kitchen , served to cast a gleam of brightness on their gloom , and they vanished in search of it with something approaching cheeriness , Johnson taking notes to the last .  They had hardly gone when Glossop whirled into the room in a state of effervescing agitation .  Mr Abney , Ogden Ford is nowhere to be found!  Mr Abney greeted the information with a prodigious sneeze .  What do you bead ? he demanded , when the paroxysm was over . He turned to me . Bister Burds , I understood you to--ah--say that the scoudrels took their departure without the boy Ford .  They certainly did . I watched them go .  I have searched the house thoroughly , said Glossop , and there are no signs of him . And not only that , the Boy Beckford cannot be found .  Mr Abney clasped his head in his hands . Poor man , he was in no condition to bear up with easy fortitude against this succession of shocks . He was like one who , having survived an earthquake , is hit by an automobile . He had partly adjusted his mind to the quiet contemplation of Mr MacGinnis and friends when he was called upon to face this fresh disaster . And he had a cold in the head , which unmans the stoutest . Napoleon would have won Waterloo if Wellington had had a cold in the head .  Augustus Beckford caddot be foud ? he echoed feebly .  They must have run away together , said Glossop .  Mr Abney sat up , galvanized .  Such a thing has never happened id the school before! he cried . It has aldways beed my--ah--codstant endeavour to make my boys look upod Sadstead House as a happy hobe . I have systebatically edcouraged a spirit of cheerful codtedment . I caddot seriously credit the fact that Augustus Beckford , one of the bost charbig boys it has ever beed by good fortude to have id by charge , has deliberately rud away .  He must have been persuaded by that boy Ford , said Glossop , who , he added morosely , I believe , is the devil in disguise .  Mr Abney did not rebuke the strength of his language . Probably the theory struck him as eminently sound . To me there certainly seemed something in it .  Subbthig bust be done at once! Mr Abney exclaimed . It is--ah--ibperative that we take ibbediate steps . They bust have gone to Londod . Bister Burds , you bust go to Londod by the next traid . I caddot go byself with this cold .  It was the irony of fate that , on the one occasion when duty really summoned that champion popper-up-to-London to the Metropolis , he should be unable to answer the call .  Very well , I said . Ill go and look out a train .  Bister Glossop , you will be in charge of the school . Perhaps you had better go back to the boys dow .  White was in the hall when I got there .  White , I said , do you know anything about the trains to London ?  Are you going to London ? he asked , in his more conversational manner . I thought he looked at me curiously as he spoke .  Yes . Ogden Ford and Lord Beckford cannot be found . Mr Abney thinks they must have run away to London .  I shouldnt wonder , said White dryly , it seemed to me . There was something distinctly odd in his manner . And youre going after them .  Yes . I must look up a train .  There is a fast train in an hour . You will have plenty of time .  Will you tell Mr Abney that , while I go and pack my bag ? And telephone for a cab .  Sure , said White , nodding .  I went up to my room and began to put a few things together in a suit-case . I felt happy , for several reasons . A visit to London , after my arduous weeks at Sanstead , was in the nature of an unexpected treat . My tastes are metropolitan , and the vision of an hour at a music-hall--I should be too late for the theatres--with supper to follow in some restaurant where there was an orchestra , appealed to me .  When I returned to the hall , carrying my bag , I found Audrey there .  Im being sent to London , I announced .  I know . White told me . Peter , bring him back .  Thats why Im being sent .  It means everything to me .  I looked at her in surprise . There was a strained , anxious expression on her face , for which I could not account . I declined to believe that anybody could care what happened to the Little Nugget purely for that amiable youths own sake . Besides , as he had gone to London willingly , the assumption was that he was enjoying himself .  I dont understand , I said . What do you mean ?  Ill tell you . Mr Ford sent me here to be near Ogden , to guard him . He knew that there was always a danger of attempts being made to kidnap him , even though he was brought over to England very quietly . That is how I come to be here . I go wherever Ogden goes . I am responsible for him . And I have failed . If Ogden is not brought back , Mr Ford will have nothing more to do with me . He never forgives failures . It will mean going back to the old work again--the dressmaking , or the waiting , or whatever I can manage to find . She gave a little shiver . Peter , I cant . All the pluck has gone out of me . Im afraid . I couldnt face all that again . Bring him back . You must . You will . Say you will .  I did not answer . I could find nothing to say; for it was I who was responsible for all her trouble . I had planned everything . I had given Ogden Ford the money that had taken him to London . And soon , unless I could reach London before it happened , and prevent him , he , with my valet Smith , would be in the Dover boat-train on his way to Monaco .     Chapter 9   I  It was only after many hours of thought that it had flashed upon me that the simplest and safest way of removing the Little Nugget was to induce him to remove himself . Once the idea had come , the rest was simple . The negotiations which had taken place that morning in the stable-yard had been brief . I suppose a boy in Ogdens position , with his record of narrow escapes from the kidnapper , comes to take things as a matter of course which would startle the ordinary boy . He assumed , I imagine , that I was the accredited agent of his mother , and that the money which I gave him for travelling expenses came from her . Perhaps he had been expecting something of the sort . At any rate , he grasped the essential points of the scheme with amazing promptitude . His little hand was extended to receive the cash almost before I had finished speaking .  The main outline of my plan was that he should slip away to London , during the afternoon , go to my rooms , where he would find Smith , and with Smith travel to his mother at Monaco . I had written to Smith , bidding him be in readiness for the expedition . There was no flaw in the scheme as I had mapped it out , and though Ogden had complicated it a little by gratuitously luring away Augustus Beckford to bear him company , he had not endangered its success .  But now an utterly unforeseen complication had arisen . My one desire now was to undo everything for which I had been plotting .  I stood there , looking at her dumbly , hating myself for being the cause of the anxiety in her eyes . If I had struck her , I could not have felt more despicable . In my misery I cursed Cynthia for leading me into this tangle .  I heard my name spoken , and turned to find White at my elbow .  Mr Abney would like to see you , sir .  I went upstairs , glad to escape . The tension of the situation had begun to tear at my nerves .  Cub id , Bister Burds , said my employer , swallowing a lozenge . His aspect was more dazed than ever . White has just bade an--ah--extraordinary cobbudicatiod to me . It seebs he is in reality a detective , an employee of Pidkertods Agedcy , of which you have , of course--ah--heard .  So White had revealed himself . On the whole , I was not surprised . Certainly his motive for concealment , the fear of making Mr Abney nervous , was removed . An inrush of Red Indians with tomahawks could hardly have added greatly to Mr Abneys nervousness at the present juncture .  Sent here by Mr Ford , I suppose ? I said . I had to say something .  Exactly . Ah--precisely . He sneezed . Bister Ford , without codsulting me--I do not cobbedt on the good taste or wisdob of his actiod--dispatched White to apply for the post of butler at this--ah--house , his predecessor having left at a bobedts dotice , bribed to do so , I strodgly suspect , by Bister Ford himself . I bay be wrodging Bister Ford , but do dot thig so .  I thought the reasoning sound .  All thad , however , resumed Mr Abney , removing his face from a jug of menthol at which he had been sniffing with the tense concentration of a dog at a rabbit-hole , is beside the poidt . I berely bedtiod it to explaid why White will accompady you to London .  What!  The exclamation was forced from me by my dismay . This was appalling . If this infernal detective was to accompany me , my chance of bringing Ogden back was gone . It had been my intention to go straight to my rooms , in the hope of finding him not yet departed . But how was I to explain his presence there to White ?  I dont think its necessary , Mr Abney , I protested . I am sure I can manage this affair by myself .  Two heads are better thad wud , said the invalid sententiously , burying his features in the jug once more .  Too many cooks spoil the broth , I replied . If the conversation was to consist of copybook maxims , I could match him as long as he pleased .  He did not keep up the intellectual level of the discussion .  Dodseds! he snapped , with the irritation of a man whose proverb has been capped by another . I had seldom heard him speak so sharply . Whites revelation had evidently impressed him . He had all the ordinary peaceful mans reverence for the professional detective .  White will accompany you , Bister Burds , he said doggedly .  Very well , I said .  After all , it might be that I should get an opportunity of giving him the slip . London is a large city .  A few minutes later the cab arrived , and White and I set forth on our mission .  We did not talk much in the cab . I was too busy with my thoughts to volunteer remarks , and White , apparently , had meditations of his own to occupy him .  It was when we had settled ourselves in an empty compartment and the train had started that he found speech . I had provided myself with a book as a barrier against conversation , and began at once to make a pretence of reading , but he broke through my defences .  Interesting book , Mr Burns ?  Very , I said .  Lifes more interesting than books .  I made no comment on this profound observation . He was not discouraged .  Mr Burns , he said , after the silence had lasted a few moments .  Yes ?  Lets talk for a spell . These train-journeys are pretty slow .  Again I seemed to detect that curious undercurrent of meaning in his voice which I had noticed in the course of our brief exchange of remarks in the hall . I glanced up and met his eye . He was looking at me in a way that struck me as curious . There was something in those bright brown eyes of his which had the effect of making me vaguely uneasy . Something seemed to tell me that he had a definite motive in forcing his conversation on me .  I guess I can interest you a heap more than that book , even if its the darndest best seller that was ever hatched .  Oh!  He lit a cigarette .  You didnt want me around on this trip , did you ?  It seemed rather unnecessary for both of us to go , I said indifferently . Still , perhaps two heads are better than one , as Mr Abney remarked . What do you propose to do when you get to London ?  He bent forward and tapped me on the knee .  I propose to stick to you like a label on a bottle , sonny , he said . Thats what I propose to do .  What do you mean ?  I was finding it difficult , such is the effect of a guilty conscience , to meet his eye , and the fact irritated me .  I want to find out that address you gave the Ford kid this morning out in the stable-yard .  It is strange how really literal figurative expressions are . I had read stories in which some astonished characters heart leaped into his mouth . For an instant I could have supposed that mine had actually done so . The illusion of some solid object blocking up my throat was extraordinarily vivid , and there certainly seemed to be a vacuum in the spot where my heart should have been . Not for a substantial reward could I have uttered a word at that moment . I could not even breathe . The horrible unexpectedness of the blow had paralysed me .  White , however , was apparently prepared to continue the chat without my assistance .  I guess you didnt know I was around , or you wouldnt have talked that way . Well , I was , and I heard every word you said . Here was the money , you said , and he was to take it and break for London , and go to the address on this card , and your pal Smith would look after him . I guess there had been some talk before that , but I didnt arrive in time to hear it . But I heard all I wanted , except that address . And thats what Im going to find out when we get to London .  He gave out this appalling information in a rich and soothing voice , as if it were some ordinary commonplace . To me it seemed to end everything . I imagined I was already as good as under arrest . What a fool I had been to discuss such a matter in a place like a stable yard , however apparently empty . I might have known that at a school there are no empty places .  I must say it jarred me when I heard you pulling that stuff , continued White . I havent what you might call a childlike faith in my fellow-man as a rule , but it had never occurred to me for a moment that you could be playing that game . It only shows , he added philosophically , that youve got to suspect everybody when it comes to a gilt-edged proposition like the Little Nugget .  The train rattled on . I tried to reduce my mind to working order , to formulate some plan , but could not .  Beyond the realization that I was in the tightest corner of my life , I seemed to have lost the power of thought .  White resumed his monologue .  You had me guessing , he admitted . I couldnt figure you out . First thing , of course , I thought you must be working in with Buck MacGinnis and his crowd . Then all that happened tonight , and I saw that , whoever you might be working in with , it wasnt Buck . And now Ive placed you . Youre not in with any one . Youre just playing it by yourself . I shouldnt mind betting this was your first job , and that you saw your chance of making a pile by holding up old man Ford , and thought it was better than schoolmastering , and grabbed it .  He leaned forward and tapped me on the knee again . There was something indescribably irritating in the action . As one who has had experience , I can state that , while to be arrested at all is bad , to be arrested by a detective with a fatherly manner is maddening .  See here , he said , we must get together over this business .  I suppose it was the recollection of the same words in the mouth of Buck MacGinnis that made me sit up with a jerk and stare at him .  Well make a great team , he said , still in that same cosy voice . If ever there was a case of fifty-fifty , this is it . Youve got the kid , and Ive got you . I cant get away with him without your help , and you cant get away with him unless you square me . Its a stand-off . The only thing is to sit in at the game together and share out . Does it go ?  He beamed kindly on my bewilderment during the space of time it takes to select a cigarette and light a match . Then , blowing a contented puff of smoke , he crossed his legs and leaned back .  When I told you I was a Pinkertons man , sonny , he said , I missed the cold truth by about a mile . But you caught me shooting off guns in the grounds , and it was up to me to say something .  He blew a smoke-ring and watched it dreamily till it melted in the draught from the ventilator .  Im Smooth Sam Fisher , he said .   II  When two emotions clash , the weaker goes to the wall . Any surprise I might have felt was swallowed up in my relief . If I had been at liberty to be astonished , my companions information would no doubt have astonished me . But I was not . I was so relieved that he was not a Pinkertons man that I did not really care what else he might be .  Its always been a habit of mine , in these little matters , he went on , to let other folks do the rough work , and chip in myself when theyve cleared the way . It saves trouble and expense . I dont travel with a gang , like that bone-headed Buck . Whats the use of a gang ? They only get tumbling over each other and spoiling everything . Look at Buck! Where is he ? Down and out . While I--  He smiled complacently . His manner annoyed me . I objected to being looked upon as a humble cats paw by this bland scoundrel .  While you--what ? I said .  He looked at me in mild surprise .  Why , I come in with you , sonny , and take my share like a gentleman .  Do you!  Well , dont I ?  He looked at me in the half-reproachful half-affectionate manner of the kind old uncle who reasons with a headstrong nephew .  Young man , he said , you surely arent thinking you can put one over on me in this business ? Tell me , you dont take me for that sort of ivory-skulled boob ? Do you imagine for one instant , sonny , that Im not next to every move in this game ? Are you deluding yourself with the idea that this thing isnt a perfect cinch for me ? Lets hear whats troubling you . You seem to have gotten some foolish ideas in your head . Lets talk it over quietly .  If you have no objection , I said , no . I dont want to talk to you , Mr Fisher . I dont like you , and I dont like your way of earning your living . Buck MacGinnis was bad enough , but at least he was a straightforward tough . Theres no excuse for you .  Surely we are unusually righteous this p .m . , are we not ? said Sam suavely .  I did not answer .  Is this not mere professional jealousy ?  This was too much for me .  Do you imagine for a moment that Im doing this for money ?  I did have that impression . Was I wrong ? Do you kidnap the sons of millionaires for your health ?  I promised that I would get this boy back to his mother . That is why I gave him the money to go to London . And that is why my valet was to have taken him to--to where Mrs Ford is .  He did not reply in words , but if ever eyebrows spoke , his said , My dear sir , really! I could not remain silent under their patent disbelief .  Thats the simple truth , I said .  He shrugged his shoulders , as who would say , Have it your own way . Let us change the subject .  You say was to have taken . Have you changed your plans ?  Yes , Im going to take the boy back to the school .  He laughed--a rich , rolling laugh . His double chin shook comfortably .  It wont do , he said , shaking his head with humorous reproach . It wont do .  You dont believe me ?  Frankly , I do not .  Very well , I said , and began to read my book .  If you want to give me the slip , he chuckled , you must do better than that . I can see you bringing the Nugget back to the school .  You will , if you wait , I said .  I wonder what that address was that you gave him , he mused . Well , I shall soon know .  He lapsed into silence . The train rolled on . I looked at my watch . London was not far off now .  The present arrangement of equal division , said Sam , breaking a long silence , holds good , of course , only in the event of your quitting this fool game and doing the square thing by me . Let me put it plainly . We are either partners or competitors . It is for you to decide . If you will be sensible and tell me that address , I will pledge my word--  Your word! I said scornfully .  Honour among thieves! replied Sam , with unruffled geniality . I wouldnt double-cross you for worlds . If , however , you think you can manage without my assistance , it will then be my melancholy duty to beat you to the kid , and collect him and the money entirely on my own account . Am I to take it , he said , as I was silent , that you prefer war to an alliance ?  I turned a page of my book and went on reading .  If Youth but knew! he sighed . Young man , I am nearly twice your age , and I have , at a modest estimate , about ten times as much sense . Yet , in your overweening self-confidence , with your ungovernable gall , you fancy you can hand me a lemon . Me! I should smile!  Do , I said . Do , while you can .  He shook his head reprovingly .  You will not be so fresh , sonny , in a few hours . You will be biting pieces out of yourself , I fear . And later on , when my automobile splashes you with mud in Piccadilly , you will taste the full bitterness of remorse . Well , Youth must buy its experience , I suppose!  I looked across at him as he sat , plump and rosy and complacent , puffing at his cigarette , and my heart warmed to the old ruffian . It was impossible to maintain an attitude of righteous iciness with him . I might loathe his mode of life , and hate him as a representative--and a leading representative--of one of the most contemptible trades on earth , but there was a sunny charm about the man himself which made it hard to feel hostile to him as an individual .  I closed my book with a bang and burst out laughing .  Youre a wonder! I said .  He beamed at what he took to be evidence that I was coming round to the friendly and sensible view of the matter .  Then you think , on consideration-- he said . Excellent! Now , my dear young man , all joking aside , you will take me with you to that address , will you not ? You observe that I do not ask you to give it to me . Let there be not so much as the faintest odour of the double-cross about this business . All I ask is that you allow me to accompany you to where the Nugget is hidden , and then rely on my wider experience of this sort of game to get him safely away and open negotiations with the dad .  I suppose your experience has been wide ? I said .  Quite tolerably--quite tolerably .  Doesnt it ever worry you the anxiety and misery you cause ?  Purely temporary , both . And then , look at it in another way . Think of the joy and relief of the bereaved parents when sonny comes toddling home again! Surely it is worth some temporary distress to taste that supreme happiness ? In a sense , you might call me a human benefactor . I teach parents to appreciate their children . You know what parents are . Father gets caught short in steel rails one morning . When he reaches home , what does he do ? He eases his mind by snapping at little Willie . Mrs Van First-Family forgets to invite mother to her freak-dinner . What happens ? Mother takes it out of William . They love him , maybe , but they are too used to him . They do not realize all he is to them . And then , one afternoon , he disappears . The agony! The remorse! How could I ever have told our lost angel to stop his darned noise! moans father . I struck him! sobs mother . With this jewelled hand I spanked our vanished darling! We were not worthy to have him , they wail together . But oh , if we could but get him back! Well they do . They get him back as soon as ever they care to come across in unmarked hundred-dollar bills . And after that they think twice before working off their grouches on the poor kid . So I bring universal happiness into the home . I dont say father doesnt get a twinge every now and then when he catches sight of the hole in his bank balance , but , darn it , whats money for if its not to spend ?  He snorted with altruistic fervour .  What makes you so set on kidnapping Ogden Ford ? I asked . I know he is valuable , but you must have made your pile by this time . I gather that you have been practising your particular brand of philanthropy for a good many years . Why dont you retire ?  He sighed .  It is the dream of my life to retire , young man . You may not believe me , but my instincts are thoroughly domestic . When I have the leisure to weave day-dreams , they centre around a cosy little home with a nice porch and stationary washtubs .  He regarded me closely , as if to decide whether I was worthy of these confidences . There was something wistful in his brown eyes . I suppose the inspection must have been favourable , or he was in a mood when a man must unbosom himself to someone , for he proceeded to open his heart to me . A man in his particular line of business , I imagine , finds few confidants , and the strain probably becomes intolerable at times .  Have you ever experienced the love of a good woman , sonny ? Its a wonderful thing . He brooded sentimentally for a moment , then continued , and--to my mind--somewhat spoiled the impressiveness of his opening words . The love of a good woman , he said , is about the darnedest wonderful lay-out that ever came down the pike . I know . Ive had some .  A spark from his cigarette fell on his hand . He swore a startled oath .  We came from the same old town , he resumed , having recovered from this interlude . Used to be kids at the same school  . . . Walked to school together  . . . me carrying her luncheon-basket and helping her over the fences  . . . Ah!  . . . Just the same when we grew up . Still pals . And that was twenty years ago  . . . The arrangement was that I should go out and make the money to buy the home , and then come back and marry her .  Then why the devil havent you done it ? I said severely .  He shook his head .  If you know anything about crooks , young man , he said , youll know that outside of their own line they are the easiest marks that ever happened . They fall for anything . At least , its always been that way with me . No sooner did I get together a sort of pile and start out for the old town , when some smooth stranger would come along and steer me up against some skin-game , and back Id have to go to work . That happened a few times , and when I did manage at last to get home with the dough I found she had married another guy . Its hard on women , you see , he explained chivalrously . They get lonesome and Roving Rupert doesnt show up , so they have to marry Stay-at-Home Henry just to keep from getting the horrors .  So shes Mrs Stay-at-Home Henry now ? I said sympathetically .  She was till a year ago . Shes a widow now . Deceased had a misunderstanding with a hydrophobia skunk , so Im informed . I believe he was a good man . Outside of licking him at school I didnt know him well . I saw her just before I left to come here . Shes as fond of me as ever . Its all settled , if only I can connect with the mazuma . And she dont want much , either . Just enough to keep the home together .  I wish you happiness , I said .  You can do better than that . You can take me with you to that address .  I avoided the subject .  What does she say to your way of making money ? I asked .  She doesnt know , and she aint going to know . I dont see why a man has got to tell his wife every little thing in his past . She thinks Im a drummer , travelling in England for a dry-goods firm . She wouldnt stand for the other thing , not for a minute . Shes very particular . Always was . Thats why Im going to quit after Ive won out over this thing of the Little Nugget . He looked at me hopefully . So you will take me along , sonny , wont you ?  I shook my head .  You wont ?  Im sorry to spoil a romance , but I cant . You must look around for some other home into which to bring happiness . The Fords is barred .  You are very obstinate , young man , he said , sadly , but without any apparent ill-feeling . I cant persuade you ?  No .  Ah , well! So we are to be rivals , not allies . You will regret this , sonny . I may say you will regret it very bitterly . When you see me in my automo--  You mentioned your automobile before .  Ah! So I did .  The train had stopped , as trains always do on English railways before entering a terminus . Presently it began to move forward hesitatingly , as if saying to itself , Now , am I really wanted here ? Shall I be welcome ? Eventually , after a second halt , it glided slowly alongside the platform .  I sprang out and ran to the cab-rank . I was aboard a taxi , bowling out of the station before the train had stopped .  Peeping out of the window at the back , I was unable to see Sam . My adroit move , I took it , had baffled him . I had left him standing .  It was a quarter of an hours drive to my rooms , but to me , in my anxiety , it seemed more . This was going to be a close thing , and success or failure a matter of minutes . If he followed my instructions Smith would be starting for the Continental boat-train tonight with his companion; and , working out the distances , I saw that , by the time I could arrive , he might already have left my rooms . Sams supervision at Sanstead Station had made it impossible for me to send a telegram . I had had to trust to chance . Fortunately my train , by a miracle , had been up to time , and at my present rate of progress I ought to catch Smith a few minutes before he left the building .  The cab pulled up . I ran up the stairs and opened the door of my apartment .  Smith! I called .  A chair scraped along the floor and a door opened at the end of the passage . Smith came out .  Thank goodness you have not started . I thought I should miss you . Where is the boy ?  The boy , sir ?  The boy I wrote to you about .  He has not arrived , sir .  Not arrived ?  No , sir .  I stared at him blankly .  How long have you been here ?  All day , sir .  You have not been out ?  Not since the hour of two , sir .  I cant understand it , I said .  Perhaps the young gentleman changed his mind and never started , sir ?  I know he started .  Smith had no further suggestion to offer .  Pending the young gentlemans arrival , sir , I remain in London ?  A fruity voice spoke at the door behind me .  What! Hasnt he arrived ?  I turned . There , beaming and benevolent , stood Mr Fisher .  It occurred to me to look your name out in the telephone directory , he explained . I might have thought of that before .  Come in here , I said , opening the door of the sitting-room . I did not want to discuss the thing with him before Smith .  He looked about the room admiringly .  So these are your quarters , he said . You do yourself pretty well , young man . So I understand that the Nugget has gone wrong in transit . He has altered his plans on the way ?  I cant understand it .  I can! You gave him a certain amount of money ?  Yes . Enough to get him to--where he was going .  Then , knowing the boy , I should say that he has found other uses for it . Hes whooping it up in London , and , I should fancy , having the time of his young life .  He got up .  This of course , he said , alters considerably any understanding we may have come to , sonny . All idea of a partnership is now out of the question . I wish you well , but I have no further use for you . Somewhere in this great city the Little Nugget is hiding , and I mean to find him--entirely on my own account . This is where our paths divide , Mr Burns . Good night .     Chapter 10   When Sam had left , which he did rather in the manner of a heavy father in melodrama , shaking the dust of an erring sons threshold off his feet , I mixed myself a high-ball , and sat down to consider the position of affairs . It did not take me long to see that the infernal boy had double-crossed me with a smooth effectiveness which Mr Fisher himself might have envied . Somewhere in this great city , as Sam had observed , he was hiding . But where ? London is a vague address .  I wondered what steps Sam was taking . Was there some underground secret service bureau to which persons of his profession had access ? I doubted it . I imagined that he , as I proposed to do , was drawing the city at a venture in the hope of flushing the quarry by accident . Yet such was the impression he had made upon me as a man of resource and sagacity , that I did not relish the idea of his getting a start on me , even in a venture so uncertain as this . My imagination began to picture him miraculously inspired in the search , and such was the vividness of the vision that I jumped up from my chair , resolved to get on the trail at once . It was hopelessly late , however , and I did not anticipate that I should meet with any success .  Nor did I . For two hours and a half I tramped the streets , my spirits sinking more and more under the influence of failure and a blend of snow and sleet which had begun to fall; and then , tired out , I went back to my rooms , and climbed sorrowfully into bed .  It was odd to wake up and realize that I was in London . Years seemed to have passed since I had left it . Time is a thing of emotions , not of hours and minutes , and I had certainly packed a considerable number of emotional moments into my stay at Sanstead House . I lay in bed , reviewing the past , while Smith , with a cheerful clatter of crockery , prepared my breakfast in the next room .  A curious lethargy had succeeded the feverish energy of the previous night . More than ever the impossibility of finding the needle in this human bundle of hay oppressed me . No one is optimistic before breakfast , and I regarded the future with dull resignation , turning my thoughts from it after a while to the past . But the past meant Audrey , and to think of Audrey hurt .  It seemed curious to me that in a life of thirty years I should have been able to find , among the hundreds of women I had met , only one capable of creating in me that disquieting welter of emotions which is called love , and hard that that one should reciprocate my feeling only to the extent of the mild liking which Audrey entertained for me .  I tried to analyse her qualifications for the place she held in my heart . I had known women who had attracted me more physically , and women who had attracted me more mentally . I had known wiser women , handsomer women , more amiable women , but none of them had affected me like Audrey . The problem was inexplicable . Any idea that we might be affinities , soul-mates destined for each other from the beginning of time , was disposed of by the fact that my attraction for her was apparently in inverse ratio to hers for me . For possibly the millionth time in the past five years I tried to picture in my mind the man Sheridan , that shadowy wooer to whom she had yielded so readily . What quality had he possessed that I did not ? Wherein lay the magnetism that had brought about his triumph ?  These were unprofitable speculations . I laid them aside until the next occasion when I should feel disposed for self-torture , and got out of bed . A bath and breakfast braced me up , and I left the house in a reasonably cheerful frame of mind .  To search at random for an individual unit among Londons millions lends an undeniable attraction to a day in town . In a desultory way I pursued my investigations through the morning and afternoon , but neither of Ogden nor of his young friend Lord Beckford was I vouchsafed a glimpse . My consolation was that Smooth Sam was probably being equally unsuccessful .  Towards the evening there arose the question of return to Sanstead . I had not gathered whether Mr Abney had intended to set any time-limit on my wanderings , or whether I was not supposed to come back except with the deserters . I decided that I had better remain in London , at any rate for another night , and went to the nearest post office to send Mr Abney a telegram to that effect .  As I was writing it , the problem which had baffled me for twenty-four hours , solved itself in under a minute . Whether my powers of inductive reasoning had been under a cloud since I left Sanstead , or whether they were normally beneath contempt , I do not know . But the fact remains , that I had completely overlooked the obvious solution of my difficulty . I think I must have been thinking so exclusively of the Little Nugget that I had entirely forgotten the existence of Augustus Beckford . It occurred to me now that , by making inquiries at the latters house , I should learn something to my advantage . A boy of the Augustus type does not run away from school without a reason . Probably some party was taking place tonight at the ancestral home , at which , tempted by the lawless Nugget , he had decided that his presence was necessary .  I knew the house well . There had been a time , when Lord Mountry and I were at Oxford , when I had spent frequent week-ends there . Since then , owing to being abroad , I had seen little of the family . Now was the moment to reintroduce myself . I hailed a cab .  Inductive reasoning had not played me false . There was a red carpet outside the house , and from within came the sounds of music .  Lady Wroxham , the mother of Mountry and the vanishing Augustus , was one of those women who take things as they come . She did not seem surprised at seeing me .  How nice of you to come and see us , she said . Somebody told me you were abroad . Ted is in the south of France in the yacht . Augustus is here . Mr Abney , his schoolmaster , let him come up for the night .  I perceived that Augustus had been playing a bold game . I saw the coaching of Ogden behind these dashing falsehoods .  You will hardly remember Sybil . She was quite a baby when you were here last . She is having her birthday-party this evening .  May I go in and help ? I said .  I wish you would . They would love it .  I doubted it , but went in . A dance had just finished . Strolling towards me in his tightest Eton suit , his face shining with honest joy , was the errant Augustus , and close behind him , wearing the blase air of one for whom custom has staled the pleasures of life , was the Little Nugget .  I think they both saw me at the same moment . The effect of my appearance on them was illustrative of their respective characters . Augustus turned a deep shade of purple and fixed me with a horrified stare . The Nugget winked . Augustus halted and shuffled his feet . The Nugget strolled up and accosted me like an old friend .  Hello! he said . How did you get here ? Say , I was going to try and get you on the phone some old time and explain things . Ive been pretty much on the jump since I hit London .  You little brute!  My gleaming eye , travelling past him , met that of the Hon . Augustus Beckford , causing that youth to jump guiltily . The Nugget looked over his shoulder .  I guess we dont want him around if were to talk business , he said . Ill go and tell him to beat it .  Youll do nothing of the kind . I dont propose to lose sight of either of you .  Oh , hes all right . You dont have to worry about him . He was going back to the school anyway tomorrow . He only ran away to go to this party . Why not let him enjoy himself while hes here ? Ill go and make a date for you to meet at the end of the show .  He approached his friend , and a short colloquy ensued , which ended in the latter shuffling off in the direction of the other revellers . Such is the buoyancy of youth that a moment later he was dancing a two-step with every appearance of careless enjoyment . The future , with its storms , seemed to have slipped from his mind .  Thats all right , said the Nugget , returning to me . Hes promised he wont duck away . Youll find him somewhere around whenever you care to look for him . Now we can talk .  I hardly like to trespass on your valuable time , I said . The airy way in which this demon boy handled what should have been--to him--an embarrassing situation irritated me . For all the authority I seemed to have over him I might have been the potted palm against which he was leaning .  Thats all right . Everything appeared to be all right with him . This sort of thing does not appeal to me . Dont be afraid of spoiling my evening . I only came because Becky was so set on it . Dancing bores me pallid , so lets get somewhere where we can sit down and talk .  I was beginning to feel that a childrens party was the right place for me . Sam Fisher had treated me as a child , and so did the Little Nugget . That I was a responsible person , well on in my thirty-first year , with a narrow escape from death and a hopeless love-affair on my record , seemed to strike neither of them . I followed my companion to a secluded recess with the utmost meekness .  He leaned back and crossed his legs .  Got a cigarette ?  I have not got a cigarette , and , if I had , I wouldnt give it to you .  He regarded me tolerantly .  Got a grouch tonight , havent you ? You seem all flittered up about something . Whats the trouble ? Sore about my not showing up at your apartment ? Ill explain that all right .  I shall be glad to listen .  Its like this . It suddenly occurred to me that a day or two one way or the other wasnt going to affect our deal and that , while I was about it , I might just as well see a bit of London before I left . I suggested it to Becky , and the idea made the biggest kind of a hit with him . I found he had only been in an automobile once in his life . Can you beat it ? Ive had one of my own ever since I was a kid . Well , naturally , it was up to me to blow him to a joy-ride , and thats where the money went .  Where the money went ?  Sure . Ive got two dollars left , and thats all . It wasnt altogether the automobiling . It was the meals that got away with my roll . Say , that kid Beckford is one swell feeder . Hes wrapping himself around the eats all the time . I guess its not smoking that does it . I havent the appetite I used to have . Well , thats how it was , you see . But Im through now . Cough up the fare and Ill make the trip tomorrow . Motherll be tickled to death to see me .  She wont see you . Were going back to the school tomorrow .  He looked at me incredulously .  Whats that ? Going back to school ?  Ive altered my plans .  Im not going back to any old school . You darent take me . Wherell you be if I tell the hot-air merchant about our deal and you slipping me the money and all that ?  Tell him what you like . He wont believe it .  He thought this over , and its truth came home to him . The complacent expression left his face .  Whats the matter with you ? Are you dippy , or what ? You get me away up to London , and the first thing that happens when Im here is that you want to take me back . You make me tired .  It was borne in upon me that there was something in his point of view . My sudden change of mind must have seemed inexplicable to him . And , having by a miracle succeeded in finding him , I was in a mood to be generous . I unbent .  Ogden , old sport , I said cordially , I think weve both had all we want of this childrens party . Youre bored and if I stop on another half hour I may be called on to entertain these infants with comic songs . We men of the world are above this sort of thing . Get your hat and coat and Ill take you to a show . We can discuss business later over a bit of supper .  The gloom of his countenance melted into a pleased smile .  You said something that time! he observed joyfully; and we slunk away to get our hats , the best of friends . A note for Augustus Beckford , requesting his presence at Waterloo Station at ten minutes past twelve on the following morning , I left with the butler . There was a certain informality about my methods which I doubt if Mr Abney would have approved , but I felt that I could rely on Augustus .  Much may be done by kindness . By the time the curtain fell on the musical comedy which we had attended all was peace between the Nugget and myself . Supper cemented our friendship , and we drove back to my rooms on excellent terms with one another . Half an hour later he was snoring in the spare room , while I smoked contentedly before the fire in the sitting-room .  I had not been there five minutes when the bell rang . Smith was in bed , so I went to the door myself and found Mr Fisher on the mat .  My feeling of benevolence towards all created things , the result of my successful handling of the Little Nugget , embraced Sam . I invited him in .  Well , I said , when I had given him a cigar and filled his glass , and how have you been getting on , Mr Fisher ? Any luck ?  He shook his head at me reproachfully .  Young man , youre deep . Ive got to hand it to you . I underestimated you . Youre very deep .  Approbation from Smooth Sam Fisher is praise indeed . But why these stately compliments ?  You took me in , young man . I dont mind owning it . When you told me the Nugget had gone astray , I lapped it up like a babe . And all the time you were putting one over on me . Well , well!  But he had gone astray , Mr Fisher .  He knocked the ash off his cigar . He wore a pained look .  You neednt keep it up , sonny . I happened to be standing within three yards of you when you got into a cab with him in Shaftesbury Avenue .  I laughed .  Well , if thats the case , let there be no secrets between us . Hes asleep in the next room .  Sam leaned forward earnestly and tapped me on the knee .  Young man , this is a critical moment . This is where , if you arent careful , you may undo all the good work you have done by getting chesty and thinking that , because youve won out so far , youre the whole show . Believe me , the difficult part is to come , and its right here that you need an experienced man to work in with you . Let me in on this and leave the negotiations with old man Ford to me . You would only make a mess of them . Ive handled this kind of thing a dozen times , and I know just how to act . You wont regret taking me on as a partner . You wont lose a cent by it . I can work him for just double what you would get , even supposing you didnt make a mess of the deal and get nothing .  Its very good of you , but there wont be any negotiations with Mr Ford . I am taking the boy back to Sanstead , as I told you . I caught his pained eye . Im afraid you dont believe me .  He drew at his cigar without replying .  It is a human weakness to wish to convince those who doubt us , even if their opinion is not intrinsically valuable . I remembered that I had Cynthias letter in my pocket . I produced it as exhibit A in my evidence and read it to him .  Sam listened carefully .  I see , he said . Who wrote that ?  Never mind . A friend of mine .  I returned the letter to my pocket .  I was going to have sent him over to Monaco , but I altered my plans . Something interfered .  What ?  I might call it coincidence , if you know what that means .  And you are really going to take him back to the school ?  I am .  We shall travel back together , he said . I had hoped I had seen the last of the place . The English countryside may be delightful in the summer , but for winter give me London . However , he sighed resignedly , and rose from his chair , I will say good-bye till tomorrow . What train do you catch ?  Do you mean to say , I demanded , that you have the nerve to come back to Sanstead after what you have told me about yourself ?  You entertain some idea of exposing me to Mr Abney ? Forget it , young man . We are both in glass houses . Dont let us throw stones . Besides , would he believe it ? What proof have you ?  I had thought this argument tolerably sound when I had used it on the Nugget . Now that it was used on myself I realized its soundness even more thoroughly . My hands were tied .  Yes , said Sam , tomorrow , after our little jaunt to London , we shall all resume the quiet , rural life once more .  He beamed expansively upon me from the doorway .  However , even the quiet , rural life has its interest . I guess we shant be dull! he said .  I believed him .     Chapter 11   Considering the various handicaps under which he laboured notably a cold in the head , a fear of the Little Nugget , and a reverence for the aristocracy--Mr Abneys handling of the situation , when the runaways returned to school , bordered on the masterly . Any sort of physical punishment being out of the question--especially in the case of the Nugget , who would certainly have retaliated with a bout of window-breaking--he had to fall back on oratory , and he did this to such effect that , when he had finished , Augustus wept openly and was so subdued that he did not ask a single question for nearly three days .  One result of the adventure was that Ogdens bed was moved to a sort of cubby-hole adjoining my room . In the house , as originally planned , this had evidently been a dressing-room . Under Mr Abneys rule it had come to be used as a general repository for lumber . My boxes were there , and a portmanteau of Glossops . It was an excellent place in which to bestow a boy in quest of whom kidnappers might break in by night . The window was too small to allow a man to pass through , and the only means of entrance was by way of my room . By night , at any rate , the Nuggets safety seemed to be assured .  The curiosity of the small boy , fortunately , is not lasting . His active mind lives mainly in the present . It was not many days , therefore , before the excitement caused by Bucks raid and the Nuggets disappearance began to subside . Within a week both episodes had been shelved as subjects of conversation , and the school had settled down to its normal humdrum life .  To me , however , there had come a period of mental unrest more acute than I had ever experienced . My life , for the past five years , had run in so smooth a stream that , now that I found myself tossed about in the rapids , I was bewildered . It was a peculiar aggravation of the difficulty of my position that in my world , the little world of Sanstead House , there should be but one woman , and she the very one whom , if I wished to recover my peace of mind , it was necessary for me to avoid .  My feelings towards Cynthia at this time defied my powers of analysis . There were moments when I clung to the memory of her , when she seemed the only thing solid and safe in a world of chaos , and moments , again , when she was a burden crushing me . There were days when I would give up the struggle and let myself drift , and days when I would fight myself inch by inch . But every day found my position more hopeless than the last .  At night sometimes , as I lay awake , I would tell myself that if only I could see her or even hear from her the struggle would be easier . It was her total disappearance from my life that made it so hard for me . I had nothing to help me to fight .  And then , one morning , as if in answer to my thoughts her letter came .  The letter startled me . It was as if there had been some telepathic communion between us .  It was very short , almost formal:  MY DEAR PETER--I want to ask you a question . I can put it quite shortly . It is this . Are your feelings towards me still the same ? I dont tell you why I ask this . I simply ask it . Whatever your answer is , it cannot affect our friendship , so be quite candid . CYNTHIA .  I sat down there and then to write my reply . The letter , coming when it did and saying what it said , had affected me profoundly . It was like an unexpected reinforcement in a losing battle . It filled me with a glow of self-confidence . I felt strong again , able to fight and win . My mood bore me away , and I poured out my whole heart to her . I told her that my feelings had not altered , that I loved her and nobody but her . It was a letter , I can see , looking back , born of fretted nerves; but at the time I had no such criticism to make . It seemed to me a true expression of my real feelings .  That the fight was not over because in my moment of exaltation I had imagined that I had conquered myself was made uncomfortably plain to me by the thrill that ran through me when , returning from posting my letter , I met Audrey . The sight of her reminded me that a reinforcement is only a reinforcement , a help towards victory , not victory itself .  For the first time I found myself feeling resentful towards her . There was no reason in my resentment . It would not have borne examination . But it was there , and its presence gave me support . I found myself combating the thrill the sight of her had caused , and looking at her with a critical and hostile eye . Who was she that she should enslave a man against his will ? Fascination exists only in the imagination of the fascinated . If he have the strength to deny the fascination and convince himself that it does not exist , he is saved . It is purely a matter of willpower and calm reasonableness . There must have been sturdy , level-headed Egyptian citizens who could not understand what people saw to admire in Cleopatra .  Thus reasoning , I raised my hat , uttered a crisp Good morning , and passed on , the very picture of the brisk man of affairs .  Peter!  Even the brisk man of affairs must stop when spoken to . Otherwise , apart from any question of politeness , it looks as if he were running away .  Her face was still wearing the faint look of surprise which my manner had called forth .  Youre in a great hurry .  I had no answer . She did not appear to expect one .  We moved towards the house in silence , to me oppressive silence . The force of her personality was beginning to beat against my defences , concerning the stability of which , under pressure , a certain uneasiness troubled my mind .  Are you worried about anything , Peter ? she said at last .  No , I said . Why ?  I was afraid you might be .  I felt angry with myself . I was mismanaging this thing in the most idiotic way . Instead of this bovine silence , gay small-talk , the easy eloquence , in fact , of the brisk man of affairs should have been my policy . No wonder Smooth Sam Fisher treated me as a child . My whole bearing was that of a sulky school-boy .  The silence became more oppressive .  We reached the house . In the hall we parted , she to upper regions , I to my classroom . She did not look at me . Her face was cold and offended .  One is curiously inconsistent . Having created what in the circumstances was a most desirable coldness between Audrey and myself , I ought to have been satisfied . Reason told me that this was the best thing that could have happened . Yet joy was one of the few emotions which I did not feel during the days which followed . My brief moment of clear-headedness had passed , and with it the exhilaration that had produced the letter to Cynthia and the resentment which had helped me to reason calmly with myself on the intrinsic nature of fascination in woman . Once more Audrey became the centre of my world . But our friendship , that elusive thing which had contrived to exist side by side with my love , had vanished . There was a breach between us which widened daily . Soon we hardly spoke .  Nothing , in short , could have been more eminently satisfactory , and the fact that I regretted it is only a proof of the essential weakness of my character .     Chapter 12   I  In those grey days there was one thought , of the many that occupied my mind , which brought with it a certain measure of consolation . It was the reflection that this state of affairs could not last for ever . The school term was drawing to a close . Soon I should be free from the propinquity which paralysed my efforts to fight . I was resolved that the last day of term should end for ever my connection with Sanstead House and all that was in it . Mrs Ford must find some other minion . If her happiness depended on the recovery of the Little Nugget , she must learn to do without happiness , like the rest of the inhabitants of this horrible world .  Meanwhile , however , I held myself to be still on duty . By what tortuous processes of thought I had arrived at the conclusion I do not know , but I considered myself responsible to Audrey for the safeguarding of the Little Nugget , and no altered relations between us could affect my position . Perhaps mixed up with this attitude of mind , was the less altruistic wish to foil Smooth Sam . His continued presence at the school was a challenge to me .  Sams behaviour puzzled me . I do not know exactly what I expected him to do , but I certainly did not expect him to do nothing . Yet day followed day , and still he made no move . He was the very model of a butler . But our dealings with one another in London had left me vigilant , and his inaction did not disarm me . It sprang from patience , not from any weakening of purpose or despair of success . Sooner or later I knew he would act , swiftly and suddenly , with a plan perfected in every detail .  But when he made his attack it was the very simplicity of his methods that tricked me , and only pure chance defeated him .  I have said that it was the custom of the staff of masters at Sanstead House School--in other words , of every male adult in the house except Mr Fisher himself--to assemble in Mr Abneys study after dinner of an evening to drink coffee . It was a ceremony , like most of the ceremonies at an establishment such as a school , where things are run on a schedule , which knew of no variation . Sometimes Mr Abney would leave us immediately after the ceremony , but he never omitted to take his part in it first .  On this particular evening , for the first time since the beginning of the term , I was seized with a prejudice against coffee . I had been sleeping badly for several nights , and I decided that abstention from coffee might remedy this .  I waited , for forms sake , till Glossop and Mr Abney had filled their cups , then went to my room , where I lay down in the dark to wrestle with a more than usually pronounced fit of depression which had descended upon me . Solitude and darkness struck me as the suitable setting for my thoughts .  At this moment Smooth Sam Fisher had no place in my meditations . My mind was not occupied with him at all . When , therefore , the door , which had been ajar , began to open slowly , I did not become instantly on the alert . Perhaps it was some sound , barely audible , that aroused me from my torpor and set my blood tingling with anticipation . Perhaps it was the way the door was opening . An honest draught does not move a door furtively , in jerks .  I sat up noiseless , tense , and alert . And then , very quietly , somebody entered the room .  There was only one person in Sanstead House who would enter a room like that . I was amused . The impudence of the thing tickled me . It seemed so foreign to Mr Fishers usual cautious methods . This strolling in and helping oneself was certainly kidnapping de luxe . In the small hours I could have understood it; but at nine oclock at night , with Glossop , Mr Abney and myself awake and liable to be met at any moment on the stairs , it was absurd . I marvelled at Smooth Sams effrontery .  I lay still . I imagined that , being in , he would switch on the electric light . He did , and I greeted him pleasantly .  And what can I do for you , Mr Fisher ?  For a man who had learned to control himself in difficult situations he took the shock badly . He uttered a startled exclamation and spun round , open-mouthed .  I could not help admiring the quickness with which he recovered himself . Almost immediately he was the suave , chatty Sam Fisher who had unbosomed his theories and dreams to me in the train to London .  I quit , he said pleasantly . The episode is closed . I am a man of peace , and I take it that you would not keep on lying quietly on that bed while I went into the other room and abstracted our young friend ? Unless you have changed your mind again , would a fifty-fifty offer tempt you ?  Not an inch .  Just so . I merely asked .  And how about Mr Abney , in any case ? Suppose we met him on the stairs ?  We should not meet him on the stairs , said Sam confidently . You did not take coffee tonight , I gather ?  I didnt--no . Why ?  He jerked his head resignedly .  Can you beat it! I ask you , young man , could I have foreseen that , after drinking coffee every night regularly for two months , you would pass it up tonight of all nights ? You certainly are my jinx , sonny . You have hung the Indian sign on me all right .  His words had brought light to me .  Did you drug the coffee ?  Did I! I fixed it so that one sip would have an insomnia patient in dreamland before he had time to say Good night . That stuff Rip Van Winkle drank had nothing on my coffee . And all wasted! Well , well!  He turned towards the door .  Shall I leave the light on , or would you prefer it off ?  On please . I might fall asleep in the dark .  Not you! And , if you did , you would dream that I was there , and wake up . There are moments , young man , when you bring me pretty near to quitting and taking to honest work .  He paused .  But not altogether . I have still a shot or two in my locker . We shall see what we shall see . I am not dead yet . Wait!  I will , and some day , when I am walking along Piccadilly , a passing automobile will splash me with mud . A heavily furred plutocrat will stare haughtily at me from the tonneau , and with a start of surprise I shall recognize--  Stranger things have happened . Be flip while you can , sonny . You win so far , but this hoodoo of mine cant last for ever .  He passed from the room with a certain sad dignity . A moment later he reappeared .  A thought strikes me , he said . The fifty-fifty proposition does not impress you . Would it make things easier if I were to offer my cooperation for a mere quarter of the profit ?  Not in the least .  Its a handsome offer .  Wonderfully . Im afraid Im not dealing on any terms .  He left the room , only to return once more . His head appeared , staring at me round the door , in a disembodied way , like the Cheshire Cat .  You wont say later on I didnt give you your chance ? he said anxiously .  He vanished again , permanently this time . I heard his steps passing down the stairs .   II  We had now arrived at the last week of term , at the last days of the last week . The holiday spirit was abroad in the school . Among the boys it took the form of increased disorderliness . Boys who had hitherto only made Glossop bellow now made him perspire and tear his hair as well . Boys who had merely spilt ink now broke windows . The Little Nugget abandoned cigarettes in favour of an old clay pipe which he had found in the stables .  As for me , I felt like a spent swimmer who sees the shore almost within his reach . Audrey avoided me when she could , and was frigidly polite when we met . But I suffered less now . A few more days , and I should have done with this phase of my life for ever , and Audrey would once more become a memory .  Complete quiescence marked the deportment of Mr Fisher during these days . He did not attempt to repeat his last effort . The coffee came to the study unmixed with alien drugs . Sam , like lightning , did not strike twice in the same place . He had the artists soul , and disliked patching up bungled work . If he made another move , it would , I knew , be on entirely fresh lines .  Ignoring the fact that I had had all the luck , I was inclined to be self-satisfied when I thought of Sam . I had pitted my wits against his , and I had won . It was a praiseworthy performance for a man who had done hitherto nothing particular in his life .  If all the copybook maxims which had been drilled into me in my childhood and my early disaster with Audrey had not been sufficient , I ought to have been warned by Sams advice not to take victory for granted till the fight was over . As Sam had said , his luck would turn sooner or later .  One realizes these truths in theory , but the practical application of them seldom fails to come as a shock . I received mine on the last morning but one of the term .  Shortly after breakfast a message was brought to me that Mr Abney would like to see me in his study . I went without any sense of disaster to come . Most of the business of the school was discussed in the study after breakfast , and I imagined that the matter had to do with some detail of the morrows exodus .  I found Mr Abney pacing the room , a look of annoyance on his face . At the desk , her back to me , Audrey was writing . It was part of her work to take charge of the business correspondence of the establishment . She did not look round when I came in , nor when Mr Abney spoke my name , but went on writing as if I did not exist .  There was a touch of embarrassment in Mr Abneys manner , for which I could not at first account . He was stately , but with the rather defensive stateliness which marked his announcements that he was about to pop up to London and leave me to do his work . He coughed once or twice before proceeding to the business of the moment .  Ah , Mr Burns , he said at length , might I ask if your plans for the holidays , the--ah--earlier part of the holidays are settled ? No ? ah--excellent .  He produced a letter from the heap of papers on the desk .  Ah--excellent . That simplifies matters considerably . I have no right to ask what I am about to--ah--in fact ask . I have no claim on your time in the holidays . But , in the circumstances , perhaps you may see your way to doing me a considerable service . I have received a letter from Mr Elmer Ford which puts me in a position of some difficulty . It is not my wish--indeed , it is foreign to my policy--to disoblige the parents of the boys who are entrusted to my--ah--care , and I should like , if possible , to do what Mr Ford asks . It appears that certain business matters call him to the north of England for a few days , this rendering it impossible for him to receive little Ogden tomorrow . It is not my custom to criticize parents who have paid me the compliment of placing their sons at the most malleable and important period of their lives , in my--ah--charge , but I must say that a little longer notice would have been a--in fact , a convenience . But Mr Ford , like so many of his countrymen , is what I believe is called a hustler . He does it now , as the expression is . In short , he wishes to leave little Ogden at the school for the first few days of the holidays , and I should be extremely obliged , Mr Burns , if you should find it possible to stay here and--ah--look after him .  Audrey stopped writing and turned in her chair , the first intimation she had given that she had heard Mr Abneys remarks .  It really wont be necessary to trouble Mr Burns , she said , without looking at me . I can take care of Ogden very well by myself .  In the case of an--ah--ordinary boy , Mrs Sheridan , I should not hesitate to leave you in sole charge as you have very kindly offered to stay and help me in this matter . But we must recollect not only--I speak frankly--not only the peculiar--ah--disposition of this particular lad , but also the fact that those ruffians who visited the house that night may possibly seize the opportunity to make a fresh attack . I should not feel--ah--justified in thrusting so heavy a responsibility upon you .  There was reason in what he said . Audrey made no reply . I heard her pen tapping on the desk and deduced her feelings . I , myself , felt like a prisoner who , having filed through the bars of his cell , is removed to another on the eve of escape . I had so braced myself up to endure till the end of term and no longer that this postponement of the day of release had a crushing effect .  Mr Abney coughed and lowered his voice confidentially .  I would stay myself , but the fact is , I am called to London on very urgent business , and shall be unable to return for a day or so . My late pupil , the--ah--the Earl of Buxton , has been--I can rely on your discretion , Mr Burns--has been in trouble with the authorities at Eton , and his guardian , an old college friend of mine--the--in fact , the Duke of Bessborough , who , rightly or wrongly , places--er--considerable reliance on my advice , is anxious to consult me on the matter . I shall return as soon as possible , but you will readily understand that , in the circumstances , my time will not be my own . I must place myself unreservedly at--ah--Bessboroughs disposal .  He pressed the bell .  In the event of your observing any suspicious characters in the neighbourhood , you have the telephone and can instantly communicate with the police . And you will have the assistance of--  The door opened and Smooth Sam Fisher entered .  You rang , sir ?  Ah! Come in , White , and close the door . I have something to say to you . I have just been informing Mr Burns that Mr Ford has written asking me to allow his son to stay on at the school for the first few days of the vacation .  He turned to Audrey .  You will doubtless be surprised , Mrs Sheridan , and possibly--ah--somewhat startled , to learn the peculiar nature of Whites position at Sanstead House . You have no objection to my informing Mrs Sheridan , White , in consideration of the fact that you will be working together in this matter ? Just so . White is a detective in the employment of Pinkertons Agency . Mr Ford--a slight frown appeared on his lofty brow--Mr Ford obtained his present situation for him in order that he might protect his son in the event of--ah--in fact , any attempt to remove him .  I saw Audrey start . A quick flush came into her face . She uttered a little exclamation of astonishment .  Just so , said Mr Abney , by way of comment on this . You are naturally surprised . The whole arrangement is excessively unusual , and , I may say--ah--disturbing . However , you have your duty to fulfil to your employer , White , and you will , of course , remain here with the boy .  Yes , sir .  I found myself looking into a bright brown eye that gleamed with genial triumph . The other was closed . In the exuberance of the moment , Smooth Sam had had the bad taste to wink at me .  You will have Mr Burns to help you , White . He has kindly consented to postpone his departure during the short period in which I shall be compelled to be absent .  I had no recollection of having given any kind consent , but I was very willing to have it assumed , and I was glad to see that Mr Fisher , though Mr Abney did not observe it , was visibly taken aback by this piece of information . But he made one of his swift recoveries .  It is very kind of Mr Burns , he said in his fruitiest voice , but I hardly think it will be necessary to put him to the inconvenience of altering his plans . I am sure that Mr Ford would prefer the entire charge of the affair to be in my hands .  He had not chosen a happy moment for the introduction of the millionaires name . Mr Abney was a man of method , who hated any dislocation of the fixed routine of life; and Mr Fords letter had upset him . The Ford family , father and son , were just then extremely unpopular with him .  He crushed Sam .  What Mr Ford would or would not prefer is , in this particular matter , beside the point . The responsibility for the boy , while he remains on the school premises , is--ah--mine , and I shall take such precautions as seem fit and adequate to--him--myself , irrespective of those which , in your opinion , might suggest themselves to Mr Ford . As I cannot be here myself , owing to--ah--urgent business in London , I shall certainly take advantage of Mr Burnss kind offer to remain as my deputy .  He paused and blew his nose , his invariable custom after these occasional outbursts of his . Sam had not wilted beneath the storm . He waited , unmoved , till all was over:  I am afraid I shall have to be more explicit , he said: I had hoped to avoid scandal and unpleasantness , but I see it is impossible .  Mr Abneys astonished face emerged slowly from behind his handkerchief .  I quite agree with you , sir , that somebody should be here to help me look after the boy , but not Mr Burns . I am sorry to have to say it , but I do not trust Mr Burns .  Mr Abneys look of astonishment deepened . I , too , was surprised . It was so unlike Sam to fling away his chances on a blundering attack like this .  What do you mean ? demanded Mr Abney .  Mr Burns is after the boy himself . He came to kidnap him .  Mr Abney , as he had every excuse for doing , grunted with amazement . I achieved the ringing laugh of amused innocence . It was beyond me to fathom Sams mind . He could not suppose that any credence would be given to his wild assertion . It seemed to me that disappointment had caused him momentarily to lose his head .  Are you mad , White ?  No , sir . I can prove what I say . If I had not gone to London with him that last time , hed have got away with the boy then , for certain .  For an instant an uneasy thought came to me that he might have something in reserve , something unknown to me , which had encouraged him to this direct attack . I dismissed the notion . There could be nothing .  Mr Abney had turned to me with a look of hopeless bewilderment . I raised my eyebrows .  Ridiculous , I said .  That this was the only comment seemed to be Mr Abneys view . He turned on Sam with the pettish anger of the mild man .  What do you mean , White , by coming to me with such a preposterous story ?  I dont say Mr Burns wished to kidnap the boy in the ordinary way , said Sam imperturbably , like those men who came that night . He had a special reason . Mr and Mrs Ford , as of course you know , sir , are divorced . Mr Burns was trying to get the boy away and take him back to his mother .  I heard Audrey give a little gasp . Mr Abneys anger became modified by a touch of doubt . I could see that these words , by lifting the accusation from the wholly absurd to the somewhat plausible , had impressed him . Once again I was gripped by the uneasy feeling that Sam had an unsuspected card to play . This might be bluff , but it had a sinister ring .  You might say , went on Sam smoothly , that this was creditable to Mr Burnss heart . But , from my employers viewpoint and yours , too , it was a chivalrous impulse that needed to be checked . Will you please read this , sir ?  He handed a letter to Mr Abney , who adjusted his glasses and began to read--at first in a detached , judicial way , then with startled eagerness .  I felt it necessary to search among Mr Burnss papers , sir , in the hope of finding--  And then I knew what he had found . From the first the blue-grey notepaper had had a familiar look . I recognized it now . It was Cynthias letter , that damning document which I had been mad enough to read to him in London . His prediction that the luck would change had come amazingly true .  I caught Sams eye . For the second time he was unfeeling enough to wink . It was a rich , comprehensive wink , as expressive and joyous as a college yell .  Mr Abney had absorbed the letter and was struggling for speech . I could appreciate his emotion . If he had not actually been nurturing a viper in his bosom , he had come , from his point of view , very near it . Of all men , a schoolmaster necessarily looks with the heartiest dislike on the would-be kidnapper .  As for me , my mind was in a whirl . I was entirely without a plan , without the very beginnings of a plan , to help me cope with this appalling situation . I was crushed by a sense of the utter helplessness of my position . To denounce Sam was impossible; to explain my comparative innocence was equally out of the question . The suddenness of the onslaught had deprived me of the power of coherent thought . I was routed .  Mr Abney was speaking .  Is your name Peter , Mr Burns ?  I nodded . Speech was beyond me .  This letter is written by--ah--by a lady . It asks you in set terms to--ah--hasten to kidnap Ogden Ford . Do you wish me to read it to you ? Or do you confess to knowing its contents ?  He waited for a reply . I had none to make .  You do not deny that you came to Sanstead House for the deliberate purpose of kidnapping Ogden Ford ?  I had nothing to say . I caught a glimpse of Audreys face , cold and hard , and shifted my eyes quickly . Mr Abney gulped . His face wore the reproachful expression of a cod-fish when jerked out of the water on the end of a line . He stared at me with pained repulsion . That scoundrelly old buccaneer Sam did the same . He looked like a shocked bishop .  I--ah--trusted you implicitly , said Mr Abney .  Sam wagged his head at me reproachfully . With a flicker of spirit I glared at him . He only wagged the more .  It was , I think , the blackest moment of my life . A wild desire for escape on any terms surged over me . That look on Audreys face was biting into my brain like an acid .  I will go and pack , I said .  This is the end of all things , I said to myself .  I had suspended my packing in order to sit on my bed and brood . I was utterly depressed . There are crises in a mans life when Reason fails to bring the slightest consolation . In vain I tried to tell myself that what had happened was , in essence , precisely what , twenty-four hours ago , I was so eager to bring about . It amounted to this , that now , at last , Audrey had definitely gone out of my life . From now on I could have no relations with her of any sort . Was not this exactly what , twenty-four hours ago , I had wished ? Twenty-four hours ago had I not said to myself that I would go away and never see her again ? Undoubtedly . Nevertheless , I sat there and groaned in spirit .  It was the end of all things .  A mild voice interrupted my meditations .  Can I help ?  Sam was standing in the doorway , beaming on me with invincible good-humour .  You are handling them wrong . Allow me . A moment more and you would have ruined the crease .  I became aware of a pair of trousers hanging limply in my grasp . He took them from me , and , folding them neatly , placed them in my trunk .  Dont get all worked up about it , sonny , he said . Its the fortune of war . Besides , what does it matter to you ? Judging by that very snug apartment in London , you have quite enough money for a young man . Losing your job here wont break you . And , if youre worrying about Mrs Ford and her feelings , dont! I guess shes probably forgotten all about the Nugget by this time . So cheer up . Youre all right!  He stretched out a hand to pat me on the shoulder , then thought better of it and drew it back .  Think of my happiness , if you want something to make you feel good . Believe me , young man , its some . I could sing! Gee , when I think that its all plain sailing now and no more troubles , I could dance! You dont know what it means to me , putting through this deal . I wish you knew Mary! Thats her name . You must come and visit us , sonny , when were fixed up in the home . Therell always be a knife and fork for you . Well make you one of the family! Lord! I can see the place as plain as I can see you . Nice frame house with a good porch . . . . Me in a rocker in my shirt-sleeves , smoking a cigar and reading the baseball news; Mary in another rocker , mending my socks and nursing the cat! Well sure have a cat . Two cats . I like cats . And a goat in the front garden . Say , itll be great!  And on the word , emotion overcoming prudence , he brought his fat hand down with a resounding smack on my bowed shoulders .  There is a limit . I bounded to my feet .  Get out! I yelped . Get out of here!  Sure , he replied agreeably . He rose without haste and regarded me compassionately . Cheer up , son! Be a sport!  There are moments when the best of men become melodramatic . I offer this as excuse for my next observation .  Clenching my fists and glaring at him , I cried , Ill foil you yet , you hound!  Some people have no soul for the dramatic . He smiled tolerantly .  Sure , he said . Anything you like , Desperate Desmond . Enjoy yourself!  And he left me .     Chapter 13   I evacuated Sanstead House unostentatiously , setting off on foot down the long drive . My luggage , I gathered , was to follow me to the station in a cart . I was thankful to Providence for the small mercy that the boys were in their classrooms and consequently unable to ask me questions . Augustus Beckford alone would have handled the subject of my premature exit in a manner calculated to bleach my hair .  It was a wonderful morning . The sky was an unclouded blue , and a fresh breeze was blowing in from the sea . I think that something of the exhilaration of approaching spring must have stirred me , for quite suddenly the dull depression with which I had started my walk left me , and I found myself alert and full of schemes .  Why should I feebly withdraw from the struggle ? Why should I give in to Smooth Sam in this tame way ? The memory of that wink came back to me with a tonic effect . I would show him that I was still a factor in the game . If the house was closed to me , was there not the Feathers ? I could lie in hiding there , and observe his movements unseen .  I stopped on reaching the inn , and was on the point of entering and taking up my position at once , when it occurred to me that this would be a false move . It was possible that Sam would not take my departure for granted so readily as I assumed . It was Sams way to do a thing thoroughly , and the probability was that , if he did not actually come to see me off , he would at least make inquiries at the station to find out if I had gone . I walked on .  He was not at the station . Nor did he arrive in the cart with my trunk . But I was resolved to risk nothing . I bought a ticket for London , and boarded the London train . It had been my intention to leave it at Guildford and catch an afternoon train back to Stanstead; but it seemed to me , on reflection , that this was unnecessary . There was no likelihood of Sam making any move in the matter of the Nugget until the following day . I could take my time about returning .  I spent the night in London , and arrived at Sanstead by an early morning train with a suit-case containing , among other things , a Browning pistol . I was a little ashamed of this purchase . To the Buck MacGinnis type of man , I suppose , a pistol is as commonplace a possession as a pair of shoes , but I blushed as I entered the gun-shop . If it had been Buck with whom I was about to deal , I should have felt less self-conscious . But there was something about Sam which made pistols ridiculous .  My first act , after engaging a room at the inn and leaving my suit-case , was to walk to the school . Before doing anything else , I felt I must see Audrey and tell her the facts in the case of Smooth Sam . If she were on her guard , my assistance might not be needed . But her present state of trust in him was fatal .  A school , when the boys are away , is a lonely place . The deserted air of the grounds , as I slipped cautiously through the trees , was almost eerie . A stillness brooded over everything , as if the place had been laid under a spell . Never before had I been so impressed with the isolation of Sanstead House . Anything might happen in this lonely spot , and the world would go on its way in ignorance . It was with quite distinct relief that , as I drew nearer the house , I caught sight of the wire of the telephone among the trees above my head . It had a practical , comforting look .  A tradesmans cart rattled up the drive and disappeared round the side of the house . This reminder , also , of the outside world was pleasant . But I could not rid myself of the feeling that the atmosphere of the place was sinister . I attributed it to the fact that I was a spy in an enemys country . I had to see without being seen . I did not imagine that Johnson , grocer , who had just passed in his cart , found anything wrong with the atmosphere . It was created for me by my own furtive attitude .  Of Audrey and Ogden there were no signs . That they were out somewhere in the grounds this mellow spring morning I took for granted; but I could not make an extended search . Already I had come nearer to the house than was prudent .  My eye caught the telephone wire again and an idea came to me . I would call her up from the inn and ask her to meet me . There was the risk that the call would be answered by Smooth Sam , but it was not great . Sam , unless he had thrown off his role of butler completely--which would be unlike the artist that he was--would be in the housekeepers room , and the ringing of the telephone , which was in the study , would not penetrate to him .  I chose a moment when dinner was likely to be over and Audrey might be expected to be in the drawing-room .  I had deduced her movements correctly . It was her voice that answered the call .  This is Peter Burns speaking .  There was a perceptible pause before she replied . When she did , her voice was cold .  Yes ?  I want to speak to you on a matter of urgent importance .  Well ?  I cant do it through the telephone . Will you meet me in half an hours time at the gate ?  Where are you speaking from ?  The Feathers . I am staying there .  I thought you were in London .  I came back . Will you meet me ?  She hesitated .  Why ?  Because I have something important to say to you--important to you .  There was another pause .  Very well .  In half an hour , then . Is Ogden Ford in bed ?  Yes .  Is his door locked ?  No .  Then lock it and bring the key with you .  Why ?  I will tell you when we meet .  I will bring it .  Thank you . Good-bye .  I hung up the receiver and set out at once for the school .  She was waiting in the road , a small , indistinct figure in the darkness .  Is that you--Peter ?  Her voice had hesitated at the name , as if at some obstacle . It was a trivial thing , but , in my present mood , it stung me .  Im afraid Im late . I wont keep you long . Shall we walk down the road ? You may not have been followed , but it is as well to be on the safe side .  Followed ? I dont understand .  We walked a few paces and halted .  Who would follow me ?  A very eminent person of the name of Smooth Sam Fisher .  Smooth Sam Fisher ?  Better known to you as White .  I dont understand .  I should be surprised if you did . I asked you to meet me here so that I could make you understand . The man who poses as a Pinkertons detective , and is staying in the house to help you take care of Ogden Ford , is Smooth Sam Fisher , a professional kidnapper .  But--but--  But what proof have I ? Was that what you were going to say ? None . But I had the information from the man himself . He told me in the train that night going to London .  She spoke quickly . I knew from her tone that she thought she had detected a flaw in my story .  Why did he tell you ?  Because he needed me as an accomplice . He wanted my help . It was I who got Ogden away that day . Sam overheard me giving money and directions to him , telling him how to get away from the school and where to go , and he gathered--correctly--that I was in the same line of business as himself . He suggested a partnership which I was unable to accept .  Why ?  Our objects were different . My motive in kidnapping Ogden was not to extract a ransom .  She blazed out at me in an absolutely unexpected manner . Till now she had listened so calmly and asked her questions with such a notable absence of emotion that the outburst overwhelmed me .  Oh , I know what your motive was . There is no need to explain that . Isnt there any depth to which a man who thinks himself in love wont stoop ? I suppose you told yourself you were doing something noble and chivalrous ? A woman of her sort can trick a man into whatever meanness she pleases , and , just because she asks him , he thinks himself a kind of knight-errant . I suppose she told you that he had ill-treated her and didnt appreciate her higher self , and all that sort of thing ? She looked at you with those big brown eyes of hers--I can see her--and drooped , and cried , till you were ready to do anything she asked you .  Whom do you mean ?  Mrs Ford , of course . The woman who sent you here to steal Ogden . The woman who wrote you that letter .  She did not write that letter . But never mind that . The reason why I wanted you to come here was to warn you against Sam Fisher . That was all . If there is any way in which I can help you , send for me . If you like , I will come and stay at the house till Mr Abney returns .  Before the words were out of my mouth , I saw that I had made a mistake . The balance of her mind was poised between suspicion and belief , and my offer turned the scale .  No , thank you , she said curtly .  You dont trust me ?  Why should I ? White may or may not be Sam Fisher . I shall be on my guard , and I thank you for telling me . But why should I trust you ? It all hangs together . You told me you were engaged to be married . You come here on an errand which no man would undertake except for a woman , and a woman with whom he was very much in love . There is that letter , imploring you to steal the boy . I know what a man will do for a woman he is fond of . Why should I trust you ?  There is this . You forget that I had the opportunity to steal Ogden if I had wanted to . I had got him away to London . But I brought him back . I did it because you had told me what it meant to you .  She hesitated , but only for an instant . Suspicion was too strong for her .  I dont believe you . You brought him back because this man whom you call Fisher got to know of your plans . Why should you have done it because of me ? Why should you have put my interests before Mrs Fords ? I am nothing to you .  For a moment a mad impulse seized me to cast away all restraint , to pour out the unspoken words that danced like imps in my brain , to make her understand , whatever the cost , my feelings towards her . But the thought of my letter to Cynthia checked me . That letter had been the irrevocable step . If I was to preserve a shred of self-respect I must be silent .  Very well , I said , good night . And I turned to go .  Peter!  There was something in her voice which whirled me round , thrilling , despite my resolution .  Are you going ?  Weakness would now be my undoing . I steadied myself and answered abruptly .  I have said all I came to say . Good night .  I turned once more and walked quickly off towards the village . I came near to running . I was in the mood when flight alone can save a man . She did not speak again , and soon I was out of danger , hurrying on through the friendly darkness , beyond the reach of her voice .  The bright light from the doorway of the Feathers , was the only illumination that relieved the blackness of the Market Square . As I approached , a man came out and stopped in the entrance to light a cigar . His back was turned towards me as he crouched to protect the match from the breeze , but something in his appearance seemed familiar .  I had only a glimpse of him as he straightened himself and walked out of the pool of light into the Square , but it was enough .  It was my much-enduring acquaintance , Mr Buck MacGinnis .     Chapter 14   I  At the receipt of custom behind the bar sat Miss Benjafield , stately as ever , relaxing her massive mind over a penny novelette .  Who was the man who just left , Miss Benjafield ? I asked .  She marked the place with a shapely thumb and looked up .  The man ? Oh , him! Hes--why , werent you in here , Mr Burns , one evening in January when--  That American ?  Thats him . What hes doing here I dont know . He disappeared quite a while back , and I havent seen him since . Nor want . Tonight up he turns again like a bad hapenny . Id like to know what hes after . No good , if you ask me .  Miss Benjafields prejudices did not easily dissolve . She prided herself , as she frequently observed , on knowing her own mind .  Is he staying here ?  Not at the Feathers . Were particular who we have here .  I thanked her for the implied compliment , ordered beer for the good of the house , and , lighting a pipe , sat down to meditate on this new development .  The vultures were gathered together with a vengeance . Sam within , Buck without , it was quite like old times , with the difference that now , I , too , was on the wrong side of the school door .  It was not hard to account for Bucks reappearance . He would , of course , have made it his business to get early information of Mr Fords movements . It would be easy for him to discover that the millionaire had been called away to the north and that the Nugget was still an inmate of Sanstead House . And here he was preparing for the grand attack .  I had been premature in removing Bucks name from the list of active combatants . Broken legs mend . I ought to have remembered that .  His presence on the scene made , I perceived , a vast difference to my plan of campaign . It was at this point that my purchase of the Browning pistol lost its absurdity and appeared in the light of an acute strategic move . With Sam the only menace , I had been prepared to play a purely waiting game , watching proceedings from afar , ready to give my help if necessary . To check Buck , more strenuous methods were called for .  My mind was made up . With Buck , that stout disciple of the frontal attack , in the field , there was only one place for me . I must get into Sanstead House and stay there on guard .  Did he intend to make an offensive movement tonight ? That was the question which occupied my mind . From the point of view of an opponent , there was this merit about Mr MacGinnis , that he was not subtle . He could be counted on with fair certainty to do the direct thing . Sooner or later he would make another of his vigorous frontal attacks upon the stronghold . The only point to be decided was whether he would make it that night . Would professional zeal cause him to omit his beauty sleep ?  I did not relish the idea of spending the night patrolling the grounds , but it was imperative that the house be protected . Then it occurred to me that the man for the vigil was Smooth Sam . If the arrival of Mr MacGinnis had complicated matters in one way , it had simplified them in another , for there was no more need for the secrecy which had been , till now , the basis of my plan of action . Bucks arrival made it possible for me to come out and fight in the open , instead of brooding over Sanstead House from afar like a Providence . Tomorrow I proposed to turn Sam out . Tonight I would use him . The thing had resolved itself into a triangular tournament , and Sam and Buck should play the first game .  Once more I called up the house on the telephone . There was a long delay before a reply came . It was Mr Fishers voice that spoke . Audrey , apparently , had not returned to the house immediately after leaving me .  Hullo! said Sam .  Good evening , Mr Fisher .  Gee! Is that you , young fellow-me-lad ? Are you speaking from London ?  No . I am at the Feathers .  He chuckled richly .  Cant tear yourself away ? Hat still in the ring ? Say , whats the use ? Why not turn it up , sonny ? Youre only wasting your time .  Do you sleep lightly , Mr Fisher ?  I dont get you .  You had better do so tonight . Buck MacGinnis is back again .  There was silence at the other end of the wire . Then I heard him swear softly . The significance of the information had not been lost on Mr Fisher .  Is that straight ?  It is .  Youre not stringing me ?  Certainly not .  Youre sure it was Buck ?  Is Bucks the sort of face one forgets ?  He swore again .  You seem disturbed , I said .  Where did you see him ? asked Sam .  Coming out of the Feathers , looking very fierce and determined . The Berserk blood of the MacGinnises is up . Hes going to do or die . Im afraid this means an all-night sitting for you , Mr Fisher .  I thought you had put him out of business!  There was a somewhat querulous note in his voice .  Only temporarily . I did my best , but he wasnt even limping when I saw him .  He did not speak for a moment . I gathered that he was pondering over the new development .  Thanks for tipping me off , sonny . Its a thing worth knowing . Why did you do it ?  Because I love you , Samuel . Good night .  I rose late and breakfasted at my leisure . The peace of the English country inn enveloped me as I tilted back my chair and smoked the first pipe of the morning . It was a day to hearten a man for great deeds , one of those days of premature summer which comes sometimes to help us bear the chill winds of early spring . The sun streamed in through the open window . In the yard below fowls made their soothing music . The thought of violence seemed very alien to such a morning .  I strolled out into the Square . I was in no hurry to end this interlude of peace and embark on what , for all practical purposes , would be a siege .  After lunch , I decided , would be time enough to begin active campaigning .  The clock on the church tower was striking two as I set forth , carrying my suit-case , on my way to the school . The light-heartedness of the morning still lingered with me . I was amused at the thought of the surprise I was about to give Mr Fisher . That wink still rankled .  As I made my way through the grounds I saw Audrey in the distance , walking with the Nugget . I avoided them and went on into the house .  About the house there was the same air of enchanted quiet which pervaded the grounds . Perhaps the stillness indoors was even more insistent . I had grown so accustomed to the never-ending noise and bustle of the boys quarters that , as I crossed the silent hall , I had an almost guilty sense of intrusion . I felt like a burglar .  Sam , the object of my visit , would , I imagined , if he were in the house at all , be in the housekeepers room , a cosy little apartment off the passage leading to the kitchen . I decided to draw that first , and was rewarded , on pushing open the half-closed door , by the sight of a pair of black-trousered legs stretched out before me from the depths of a wicker-work armchair . His portly middle section , rising beyond like a small hill , heaved rhythmically . His face was covered with a silk handkerchief , from beneath which came , in even succession , faint and comfortable snores . It was a peaceful picture--the good man taking his rest; and for me it had an added attractiveness in that it suggested that Sam was doing by day what my information had prevented him from doing in the night . It had been some small consolation to me , as I lay trying to compose my anxious mind for sleep on the previous night , that Mr Fisher also was keeping his vigil .  Pleasing as Sam was as a study in still life , pressure of business compelled me to stir him into activity . I prodded him gently in the centre of the rising territory beyond the black trousers . He grunted discontentedly and sat up . The handkerchief fell from his face , and he blinked at me , first with the dazed glassiness of the newly awakened , then with a Souls Awakening expression , which spread over his face until it melted into a friendly smile .  Hello , young man!  Good afternoon . You seem tired .  He yawned cavernously .  Lord! What a night!  Did Buck drop in ?  No , but I thought he had every time I heard a board creak . I didnt dare close my eyes for a minute . Have you ever stayed awake all night , waiting for the goblins that get you if you dont watch out ? Well , take it from me its no picnic .  His face split in another mammoth yawn . He threw his heart into it , as if life held no other tasks for him . Only in alligators have I ever seen its equal .  I waited till the seismic upheaval had spent itself . Then I came to business .  Im sorry you had a disturbed night , Mr Fisher . You must make up for it this afternoon . You will find the beds very comfortable .  Hows that ?  At the Feathers . I should go there , if I were you . The charges are quite reasonable , and the food is good . You will like the Feathers .  I dont get you , sonny .  I was trying to break it gently to you that you are about to move from this house . Now . At once . Take your last glimpse of the old home , Sam , and out into the hard world .  He looked at me inquiringly .  You seem to be talking , young man; words appear to be fluttering from you; but your meaning , if any , escapes me .  My meaning is that I am about to turn you out . I am coming back here , and there is not room for both of us . So , if you do not see your way to going quietly , I shall take you by the back of the neck and run you out . Do I make myself fairly clear now ?  He permitted himself a rich chuckle .  You have gall , young man . Well , I hate to seem unfriendly . I like you , sonny . You amuse me--but there are moments when one wants to be alone . I have a whole heap of arrears of sleep to make up . Trot along , kiddo , and quit disturbing uncle . Tie a string to yourself and disappear . Bye-bye .  The wicker-work creaked as he settled his stout body . He picked up the handkerchief .  Mr Fisher , I said , I have no wish to propel your grey hairs at a rapid run down the drive , so I will explain further . I am physically stronger than you . I mean to turn you out . How can you prevent it ? Mr Abney is away . You cant appeal to him . The police are at the end of the telephone , but you cant appeal to them . So what can you do , except go ? Do you get me now ?  He regarded the situation in thoughtful silence . He allowed no emotion to find expression in his face , but I knew that the significance of my remarks had sunk in . I could almost follow his mind as he tested my position point by point and found it impregnable .  When he spoke it was to accept defeat jauntily .  You are my jinx , young man . I said it all along . Youre really set on my going ? Say no more . Ill go . After all , its quiet at the inn , and what more does a man want at my time of life ?  I went out into the garden to interview Audrey .  She was walking up and down on the tennis-lawn . The Nugget , lounging in a deck-chair , appeared to be asleep .  She caught sight of me as I came out from the belt of trees , and stopped . I had the trying experience of walking across open country under hostile observation .  The routing of Sam had left me alert and self-confident . I felt no embarrassment . I greeted her briskly .  Good afternoon . I have been talking to Sam Fisher . If you wait , you will see him passing away down the drive . He is leaving the house . I am coming back .  Coming back ?  She spoke incredulously , or , rather , as if my words had conveyed no meaning . It was so that Sam had spoken . Her mind , like his , took time to adjust itself to the unexpected .  She seemed to awake to my meaning with a start .  Coming back ? Her eyes widened . The flush deepened on her cheeks . But I told you--  I know what you told me . You said you did not trust me . It doesnt matter . I am coming back whether you trust me or not . This house is under martial law , and I am in command . The situation has changed since I spoke to you last night . Last night I was ready to let you have your way . I intended to keep an eye on things from the inn . But its different now . It is not a case of Sam Fisher any longer . You could have managed Sam . Its Buck MacGinnis now , the man who came that night in the automobile . I saw him in the village after I left you . Hes dangerous .  She looked away , past me , in the direction of the drive . I followed her gaze . A stout figure , carrying a suit-case , was moving slowly down it .  I smiled . Her eyes met mine , and I saw the anger that had been lying at the back of them flash out . Her chin went up with the old defiant tilt . I was sorry I had smiled . It was my old fault , the complacency that would not be hidden .  I dont believe you! she cried . I dont trust you!  It is curious how ones motive for embarking on a course of conduct changes or disappears altogether as the action develops . Once started on an enterprise it is as if one proceeded with it automatically , irrespective of ones original motives . I had begun what I might call the second phase of this matter of the Little Nugget , the abandoning of Cynthias cause in favour of Audreys , with a clear idea of why I was doing it . I had set myself to resist the various forces which were trying to take Ogden from Audrey , for one simple reason , because I loved Audrey and wished to help her . That motive , if it still existed at all , did so only in the form of abstract chivalry . My personal feelings towards her seemed to have undergone a complete change , dating from our parting in the road the night before . I found myself now meeting hostility with hostility . I looked at her critically and told myself that her spell was broken at last , that , if she disliked me , I was at least indifferent to her .  And yet , despite my altered feelings , my determination to help her never wavered . The guarding of Ogden might be--primarily--no business of mine , but I had adopted it as my business .  I dont ask you to trust me , I said . We have settled all that . Theres no need to go over old ground . Think what you please about this . Ive made up my mind .  If you mean to stay , I suppose I cant prevent you .  Exactly .  Sam appeared again in a gap in the trees , walking slowly and pensively , as one retreating from his Moscow . Her eyes followed him till he was out of sight .  If you like , I said bitterly , you may put what I am doing down to professional rivalry . If I am in love with Mrs Ford and am here to steal Ogden for her , it is natural for me to do all I can to prevent Buck MacGinnis getting him . There is no need for you to look on me as an ally because we are working together .  We are not working together .  We shall be in a very short time . Buck will not let another night go by without doing something .  I dont believe that you saw him .  Just as you please , I said , and walked away . What did it matter to me what she believed ?  The day dragged on . Towards evening the weather broke suddenly , after the fashion of spring in England . Showers of rain drove me to the study .  It must have been nearly ten oclock when the telephone rang .  It was Mr Fisher .  Hello , is that you , sonny ?  It is . Do you want anything ?  I want a talk with you . Business . Can I come up ?  If you wish it .  Ill start right away .  It was some fifteen minutes later that I heard in the distance the engines of an automobile . The headlights gleamed through the trees , and presently the car swept round the bend of the drive and drew up at the front door . A portly figure got down and rang the bell . I observed these things from a window on the first floor , overlooking the front steps; and it was from this window that I spoke .  Is that you , Mr Fisher ?  He backed away from the door .  Where are you ?  Is that your car ?  It belongs to a friend of mine .  I didnt know you meant to bring a party .  Theres only three of us . Me , the chauffeur , and my friend--MacGinnis .  The possibility , indeed the probability , of Sam seeking out Buck and forming an alliance had occurred to me , and I was prepared for it . I shifted my grip on the automatic pistol in my hand .  Mr Fisher .  Hello!  Ask your friend MacGinnis to be good enough to step into the light of that lamp and drop his gun .  There was a muttered conversation . I heard Bucks voice rumbling like a train going under a bridge . The request did not appear to find favour with him . Then came an interlude of soothing speech from Mr Fisher . I could not distinguish the words , but I gathered that he was pointing out to him that , on this occasion only , the visit being for the purposes of parley and not of attack , pistols might be looked on as non-essentials . Whatever his arguments , they were successful , for , finally , humped as to the back and muttering , Buck moved into the light .  Good evening , Mr MacGinnis , I said . Im glad to see your leg is all right again . I wont detain you a moment . Just feel in your pockets and shed a few of your guns , and then you can come in out of the rain . To prevent any misunderstanding , I may say I have a gun of my own . It is trained on you now .  I aint got no gun .  Come along . This is no time for airy persiflage . Out with them .  A moments hesitation , and a small black pistol fell to the ground .  No more ?  Think Im a regiment ?  I dont know what you are . Well , Ill take your word for it . You will come in one by one , with your hands up .  I went down and opened the door , holding my pistol in readiness against the unexpected .   II  Sam came first . His raised hands gave him a vaguely pontifical air (Bishop Blessing Pilgrims) , and the kindly smile he wore heightened the illusion . Mr MacGinnis , who followed , suggested no such idea . He was muttering moodily to himself , and he eyed me askance .  I showed them into the classroom and switched on the light . The air was full of many odours . Disuse seems to bring out the inky-chalky , appley-deal-boardy bouquet of a classroom as the night brings out the scent of flowers . During the term I had never known this classroom smell so exactly like a classroom . I made use of my free hand to secure and light a cigarette .  Sam rose to a point of order .  Young man , he said . I should like to remind you that we are here , as it were , under a flag of truce . To pull a gun on us and keep us holding our hands up this way is raw work . I feel sure I speak for my friend Mr MacGinnis .  He cocked an eye at his friend Mr MacGinnis , who seconded the motion by expectorating into the fireplace . I had observed at a previous interview his peculiar gift for laying bare his soul by this means of mode of expression . A man of silent habit , judged by the more conventional standard of words , he was almost an orator in expectoration .  Mr MacGinnis agrees with me , said Sam cheerfully . Do we take them down ? Have we your permission to assume Position Two of these Swedish exercises ? All we came for was a little friendly chat among gentlemen , and we can talk just as well--speaking for myself , better--in a less strained attitude . A little rest , Mr Burns! A little folding of the hands ? Thank you .  He did not wait for permission , nor was it necessary . Sam and the melodramatic atmosphere was as oil and water . It was impossible to blend them . I laid the pistol on the table and sat down . Buck , after one wistful glance at the weapon , did the same . Sam was already seated , and was looking so cosy and at home that I almost felt it remiss of me not to have provided sherry and cake for this pleasant gathering .  Well , I said , what can I do for you ?  Let me explain , said Sam . As you have , no doubt , gathered , Mr MacGinnis and I have gone into partnership . The Little Nugget Combine!  I gathered that--well ?  Judicious partnerships are the soul of business . Mr MacGinnis and I have been rivals in the past , but we both saw that the moment had come for the genial smile , the hearty handshake , in fact , for an alliance . We form a strong team , sonny . My partners speciality is action . I supply the strategy . Say , cant you see youre up against it ? Why be foolish ?  You think youre certain to win ?  Its a cinch .  Then why trouble to come here and see me ?  I appeared to have put into words the smouldering thought which was vexing Mr MacGinnis . He burst into speech .  Ahr chee! Sure! Whats de use ? Didnt I tell youse ? Whats de use of wastin time ? What are we spielin away here for ? Lets get busy .  Sam waved a hand towards him with the air of a lecturer making a point .  You see! The man of action! He likes trouble . He asks for it . He eats it alive . Now I prefer peace . Why have a fuss when you can get what you want quietly ? Thats my motto . Thats why weve come . Its the old proposition . Were here to buy you out . Yes , I know you have turned the offer down before , but things have changed . Your stock has fallen . In fact , instead of letting you in on sharing terms , we only feel justified now in offering a commission . For the moment you may seem to hold a strong position . You are in the house , and youve got the boy . But theres nothing to it really . We could get him in five minutes if we cared to risk having a fuss . But it seems to me theres no need of any fuss . We should win dead easy all right , if it came to trouble; but , on the other hand , youve a gun , and theres a chance some of us might get hurt , so whats the good when we can settle it quietly ? How about it , sonny ?  Mr MacGinnis began to rumble , preparatory to making further remarks on the situation , but Sam waved him down and turned his brown eyes inquiringly on me .  Fifteen per cent is our offer , he said .  And to think it was once fifty-fifty!  Strict business!  Business ? Its sweating!  Its our limit . And it wasnt easy to make Buck here agree to that . He kicked like a mule .  Buck shuffled his feet and eyed me disagreeably . I suppose it is hard to think kindly of a man who has broken your leg . It was plain that , with Mr MacGinnis , bygones were by no means bygones .  I rose .  Well , Im sorry you should have had the trouble of coming here for nothing . Let me see you out . Single file , please .  Sam looked aggrieved .  You turn it down ?  I do .  One moment . Lets have this thing clear . Do you realize what youre up against ? Dont think its only Buck and me youve got to tackle . All the boys are here , waiting round the corner , the same gang that came the other night . Be sensible , sonny . You dont stand a dogs chance . I shouldnt like to see you get hurt . And you never know what may not happen . The boys are pretty sore at you because of what you did that night . I shouldnt act like a bonehead , sonny--honest .  There was a kindly ring in his voice which rather touched me . Between him and me there had sprung up an odd sort of friendship . He meant business; but he would , I knew , be genuinely sorry if I came to harm . And I could see that he was quite sincere in his belief that I was in a tight corner and that my chances against the Combine were infinitesimal . I imagine that , with victory so apparently certain , he had had difficulty in persuading his allies to allow him to make his offer .  But he had overlooked one thing--the telephone . That he should have made this mistake surprised me . If it had been Buck , I could have understood it . Bucks was a mind which lent itself to such blunders . From Sam I had expected better things , especially as the telephone had been so much in evidence of late . He had used it himself only half an hour ago .  I clung to the thought of the telephone . It gave me the quiet satisfaction of the gambler who holds the unforeseen ace . The situation was in my hands . The police , I knew , had been profoundly stirred by Mr MacGinniss previous raid . When I called them up , as I proposed to do directly the door had closed on the ambassadors , there would be no lack of response . It would not again be a case of Inspector Bones and Constable Johnson to the rescue . A great cloud of willing helpers would swoop to our help .  With these thoughts in my mind , I answered Sam pleasantly but firmly .  Im sorry Im unpopular , but all the same--  I indicated the door .  Emotion that could only be expressed in words and not through his usual medium welled up in Mr MacGinnis . He sprang forward with a snarl , falling back as my faithful automatic caught his eye .  Say , you! Listen here! Youll--  Sam , the peaceable , plucked at his elbow .  Nothing doing , Buck . Step lively .  Buck wavered , then allowed himself to be drawn away . We passed out of the classroom in our order of entry .  An exclamation from the stairs made me look up . Audrey was leaning over the banisters . Her face was in the shadow , but I gathered from her voice that the sight of our little procession had startled her . I was not surprised . Buck was a distinctly startling spectacle , and his habit of growling to himself , as he walked , highly disturbing to strangers .  Good evening , Mrs Sheridan , said Sam suavely .  Audrey did not speak . She seemed fascinated by Buck .  I opened the front door and they passed out . The automobile was still purring on the drive . Bucks pistol had disappeared . I supposed the chauffeur had picked it up , a surmise which was proved correct a few moments later , when , just as the car was moving off , there was a sharp crack and a bullet struck the wall to the right of the door . It was a random shot , and I did not return it . Its effect on me was to send me into the hall with a leap that was almost a back-somersault . Somehow , though I was keyed up for violence and the shooting of pistols , I had not expected it at just that moment , and I was disagreeably surprised at the shock it had given me . I slammed the door and bolted it . I was intensely irritated to find that my fingers were trembling .  Audrey had left the stairs and was standing beside me .  They shot at me , I said .  By the light of the hall lamp I could see that she was very pale .  It missed by a mile . My nerves had not recovered and I spoke abruptly . Dont be frightened .  I--I was not frightened , she said , without conviction .  I was , I said , with conviction . It was too sudden for me . Its the sort of thing one wants to get used to gradually . I shall be ready for it another time .  I made for the stairs .  Where are you going ?  Im going to call up the police-station .  Peter .  Yes ?  Was--was that man the one you spoke of ?  Yes , that was Buck MacGinnis . He and Sam have gone into partnership .  She hesitated .  Im sorry , she said .  I was half-way up the stairs by this time . I stopped and looked over the banisters .  Sorry ?  I didnt believe you this afternoon .  Oh , thats all right , I said . I tried to make my voice indifferent , for I was on guard against insidious friendliness . I had bludgeoned my mind into an attitude of safe hostility towards her , and I saw the old chaos ahead if I allowed myself to abandon it .  I went to the telephone and unhooked the receiver .  There is apt to be a certain leisureliness about the methods of country telephone-operators , and the fact that a voice did not immediately ask me what number I wanted did not at first disturb me . Suspicion of the truth came to me , I think , after my third shout into the receiver had remained unanswered . I had suffered from delay before , but never such delay as this .  I must have remained there fully two minutes , shouting at intervals , before I realized the truth . Then I dropped the receiver and leaned limply against the wall . For the moment I was as stunned as if I had received a blow . I could not even think . It was only by degrees that I recovered sufficiently to understand that Audrey was speaking to me .  What is it ? Dont they answer ?  It is curious how the mind responds to the need for making an effort for the sake of somebody else . If I had had only myself to think of , it would , I believe , have been a considerable time before I could have adjusted my thoughts to grapple with this disaster . But the necessity of conveying the truth quietly to Audrey and of helping her to bear up under it steadied me at once . I found myself thinking quite coolly how best I might break to her what had happened .  Im afraid , I said , I have something to tell you which may--  She interrupted me quickly .  What is it ? Cant you make them answer ?  I shook my head . We looked at each other in silence .  Her mind leaped to the truth more quickly than mine had done .  They have cut the wire!  I took up the receiver again and gave another call . There was no reply .  Im afraid so , I said .     Chapter 15   I  What shall we do ? said Audrey .  She looked at me hopefully , as if I were a mine of ideas . Her voice was level , without a suggestion of fear in it . Women have the gift of being courageous at times when they might legitimately give way . It is part of their unexpectedness .  This was certainly such an occasion . Daylight would bring us relief , for I did not suppose that even Buck MacGinnis would care to conduct a siege which might be interrupted by the arrival of tradesmens carts; but while the darkness lasted we were completely cut off from the world . With the destruction of the telephone wire our only link with civilization had been snapped . Even had the night been less stormy than it was , there was no chance of the noise of our warfare reaching the ears of anyone who might come to the rescue . It was as Sam had said , Bucks energy united to his strategy formed a strong combination .  Broadly speaking , there are only two courses open to a beleaguered garrison . It can stay where it is , or it can make a sortie . I considered the second of these courses .  It was possible that Sam and his allies had departed in the automobile to get reinforcements , leaving the coast temporarily clear; in which case , by escaping from the house at once , we might be able to slip unobserved through the grounds and reach the village in safety . To support this theory there was the fact that the car , on its late visit , had contained only the chauffeur and the two ambassadors , while Sam had spoken of the remainder of Bucks gang as being in readiness to attack in the event of my not coming to terms . That might mean that they were waiting at Bucks headquarters , wherever those might be--at one of the cottages down the road , I imagined; and , in the interval before the attack began , it might be possible for us to make our sortie with success .  Is Ogden in bed ? I asked .  Yes .  Will you go and get him up as quickly as you can ?  I strained my eyes at the window , but it was impossible to see anything . The rain was still falling heavily . If the drive had been full of men they would have been invisible to me .  Presently Audrey returned , followed by Ogden . The Little Nugget was yawning the aggrieved yawns of one roused from his beauty sleep .  Whats all this ? he demanded .  Listen , I said . Buck MacGinnis and Smooth Sam Fisher have come after you . They are outside now . Dont be frightened .  He snorted derisively .  Whos frightened ? I guess they wont hurt me . How do you know its them ?  They have just been here . The man who called himself White , the butler , was really Sam Fisher . He has been waiting an opportunity to get you all the term .  White! Was he Sam Fisher ? He chuckled admiringly . Say , hes a wonder!  They have gone to fetch the rest of the gang .  Why dont you call the cops ?  They have cut the wire .  His only emotions at the news seemed to be amusement and a renewed admiration for Smooth Sam . He smiled broadly , the little brute .  Hes a wonder! he repeated . I guess hes smooth , all right . Hes the limit! Hell get me all right this trip . I bet you a nickel he wins out .  I found his attitude trying . That he , the cause of all the trouble , should be so obviously regarding it as a sporting contest got up for his entertainment , was hard to bear . And the fact that , whatever might happen to myself , he was in no danger , comforted me not at all . If I could have felt that we were in any way companions in peril , I might have looked on the bulbous boy with quite a friendly eye . As it was , I nearly kicked him .  We had better waste no time , suggested Audrey , if we are going .  I think we ought to try it , I said .  Whats that ? asked the Nugget . Go where ?  We are going to steal out through the back way and try to slip through to the village .  The Nuggets comment on the scheme was brief and to the point . He did not embarrass me with fulsome praise of my strategic genius .  Of all the fool games! he said simply . In this rain ? No , sir!  This new complication was too much for me . In planning out my manoeuvres I had taken his cooperation for granted . I had looked on him as so much baggage--the impedimenta of the retreating army . And , behold , a mutineer!  I took him by the scruff of the neck and shook him . It was a relief to my feelings and a sound move . The argument was one which he understood .  Oh , all right , he said . Anything you like . Come on . But it sounds to me like darned foolishness!  If nothing else had happened to spoil the success of that sortie , the Nuggets depressing attitude would have done so . Of all things , it seems to me , a forlorn hope should be undertaken with a certain enthusiasm and optimism if it is to have a chance of being successful . Ogden threw a gloom over the proceedings from the start . He was cross and sleepy , and he condemned the expedition unequivocally . As we moved towards the back door he kept up a running stream of abusive comment . I silenced him before cautiously unbolting the door , but he had said enough to damp my spirits . I do not know what effect it would have had on Napoleons tactics if his army--say , before Austerlitz--had spoken of his manoeuvres as a fool game and of himself as a big chump , but I doubt if it would have stimulated him .  The back door of Sanstead House opened on to a narrow yard , paved with flagstones and shut in on all sides but one by walls . To the left was the outhouse where the coal was stored , a squat barnlike building: to the right a wall that appeared to have been erected by the architect in an outburst of pure whimsicality . It just stood there . It served no purpose that I had ever been able to discover , except to act as a cats club-house .  Tonight , however , I was thankful for this wall . It formed an important piece of cover . By keeping in its shelter it was possible to work round the angle of the coal-shed , enter the stable-yard , and , by making a detour across the football field , avoid the drive altogether . And it was the drive , in my opinion , that might be looked on as the danger zone .  The Nuggets complaints , which I had momentarily succeeded in checking , burst out afresh as the rain swept in at the open door and lashed our faces . Certainly it was not an ideal night for a ramble . The wind was blowing through the opening at the end of the yard with a compressed violence due to the confined space . There was a suggestion in our position of the Cave of the Winds under Niagara Falls , the verisimilitude of which was increased by the stream of water that poured down from the gutter above our heads . The Nugget found it unpleasant , and said so shrilly .  I pushed him out into the storm , still protesting , and we began to creep across the yard . Half-way to the first point of importance of our journey , the corner of the coal-shed , I halted the expedition . There was a sudden lull in the wind , and I took advantage of it to listen .  From somewhere beyond the wall , apparently near the house , sounded the muffled note of the automobile . The siege-party had returned .  There was no time to be lost . Apparently the possibility of a sortie had not yet occurred to Sam , or he would hardly have left the back door unguarded; but a general of his astuteness was certain to remedy the mistake soon , and our freedom of action might be a thing of moments . It behoved us to reach the stable-yard as quickly as possible . Once there , we should be practically through the enemys lines .  Administering a kick to the Nugget , who showed a disposition to linger and talk about the weather , I moved on , and we reached the corner of the coal-shed in safety .  We had now arrived at the really perilous stage in our journey . Having built his wall to a point level with the end of the coal-shed , the architect had apparently wearied of the thing and given it up; for it ceased abruptly , leaving us with a matter of half a dozen yards of open ground to cross , with nothing to screen us from the watchers on the drive . The flagstones , moreover , stopped at this point . On the open space was loose gravel . Even if the darkness allowed us to make the crossing unseen , there was the risk that we might be heard .  It was a moment for a flash of inspiration , and I was waiting for one , when that happened which took the problem out of my hands . From the interior of the shed on our left there came a sudden scrabbling of feet over loose coal , and through the square opening in the wall , designed for the peaceful purpose of taking in sacks , climbed two men . A pistol cracked . From the drive came an answering shout . We had been ambushed .  I had misjudged Sam . He had not overlooked the possibility of a sortie .  It is the accidents of life that turn the scale in a crisis . The opening through which the men had leaped was scarcely a couple of yards behind the spot where we were standing . If they had leaped fairly and kept their feet , they would have been on us before we could have moved . But Fortune ordered it that , zeal outrunning discretion , the first of the two should catch his foot in the woodwork and fall on all fours , while the second , unable to check his spring , alighted on top of him , and , judging from the stifled yell which followed , must have kicked him in the face .  In the moment of their downfall I was able to form a plan and execute it .  The stables!  I shouted the words to Audrey in the act of snatching up the Nugget and starting to run . She understood . She did not hesitate in the direction of the house for even the instant which might have undone us , but was with me at once; and we were across the open space and in the stable-yard before the first of the men in the drive loomed up through the darkness . Half of the wooden double-gate of the yard was open , and the other half served us as a shield . They fired as they ran--at random , I think , for it was too dark for them to have seen us clearly--and two bullets slapped against the gate . A third struck the wall above our heads and ricocheted off into the night . But before they could fire again we were in the stables , the door slammed behind us , and I had dumped the Nugget on the floor , and was shooting the heavy bolts into their places . Footsteps clattered over the flagstones and stopped outside . Some weighty body plunged against the door . Then there was silence . The first round was over .  The stables , as is the case in most English country-houses , had been , in its palmy days , the glory of Sanstead House . In whatever other respect the British architect of that period may have fallen short , he never scamped his work on the stables . He built them strong and solid , with walls fitted to repel the assaults of the weather , and possibly those of men as well , for the Boones in their day had been mighty owners of race-horses at a time when men with money at stake did not stick at trifles , and it was prudent to see to it that the spot where the favourite was housed had something of the nature of a fortress . The walls were thick , the door solid , the windows barred with iron . We could scarcely have found a better haven of refuge .  Under Mr Abneys rule , the stables had lost their original character . They had been divided into three compartments , each separated by a stout wall . One compartment became a gymnasium , another the carpenters shop , the third , in which we were , remained a stable , though in these degenerate days no horse ever set foot inside it , its only use being to provide a place for the odd-job man to clean shoes . The mangers which had once held fodder were given over now to brushes and pots of polish . In term-time , bicycles were stored in the loose-box which had once echoed to the tramping of Derby favourites .  I groped about among the pots and brushes , and found a candle-end , which I lit . I was running a risk , but it was necessary to inspect our ground . I had never troubled really to examine this stable before , and I wished to put myself in touch with its geography .  I blew out the candle , well content with what I had seen . The only two windows were small , high up , and excellently barred . Even if the enemy fired through them there were half a dozen spots where we should be perfectly safe . Best of all , in the event of the door being carried by assault , we had a second line of defence in a loft . A ladder against the back wall led to it , by way of a trap-door . Circumstances had certainly been kind to us in driving us to this apparently impregnable shelter .  On concluding my inspection , I became aware that the Nugget was still occupied with his grievances . I think the shots must have stimulated his nerve centres , for he had abandoned the languid drawl with which , in happier moments , he was wont to comment on lifes happenings , and was dealing with the situation with a staccato briskness .  Of all the darned fool lay-outs I ever struck , this is the limit . What do those idiots think theyre doing , shooting us up that way ? It went within an inch of my head . It might have killed me . Gee , and Im all wet . Im catching cold . Its all through your blamed foolishness , bringing us out here . Why couldnt we stay in the house ?  We could not have kept them out of the house for five minutes , I explained . We can hold this place .  Who wants to hold it ? I dont . What does it matter if they do get me ? I dont care . Ive a good mind to walk straight out through that door and let them rope me in . It would serve Dad right . It would teach him not to send me away from home to any darned school again . What did he want to do it for ? I was all right where I was . I--  A loud hammering on the door cut off his eloquence . The intermission was over , and the second round had begun .  It was pitch dark in the stable now that I had blown out the candle , and there is something about a combination of noise and darkness which tries the nerves . If mine had remained steady , I should have ignored the hammering . From the sound , it appeared to be made by some wooden instrument--a mallet from the carpenters shop I discovered later--and the door could be relied on to hold its own without my intervention . For a novice to violence , however , to maintain a state of calm inaction is the most difficult feat of all . I was irritated and worried by the noise , and exaggerated its importance . It seemed to me that it must be stopped at once .  A moment before , I had bruised my shins against an empty packing-case , which had found its way with other lumber into the stable . I groped for this , swung it noiselessly into position beneath the window , and , standing on it , looked out . I found the catch of the window , and opened it . There was nothing to be seen , but the sound of the hammering became more distinct; and pushing an arm through the bars , I emptied my pistol at a venture .  As a practical move , the action had flaws . The shots cannot have gone anywhere near their vague target . But as a demonstration , it was a wonderful success . The yard became suddenly full of dancing bullets . They struck the flagstones , bounded off , chipped the bricks of the far wall , ricocheted from those , buzzed in all directions , and generally behaved in a manner calculated to unman the stoutest hearted .  The siege-party did not stop to argue . They stampeded as one man . I could hear them clattering across the flagstones to every point of the compass . In a few seconds silence prevailed , broken only by the swish of the rain . Round two had been brief , hardly worthy to be called a round at all , and , like round one , it had ended wholly in our favour .  I jumped down from my packing-case , swelling with pride . I had had no previous experience of this sort of thing , yet here I was handling the affair like a veteran . I considered that I had a right to feel triumphant . I lit the candle again , and beamed protectively upon the garrison .  The Nugget was sitting on the floor , gaping feebly , and awed for the moment into silence . Audrey , in the far corner , looked pale but composed . Her behaviour was perfect . There was nothing for her to do , and she was doing it with a quiet self-control which won my admiration . Her manner seemed to me exactly suited to the exigencies of the situation . With a super-competent dare-devil like myself in charge of affairs , all she had to do was to wait and not get in the way .  I didnt hit anybody , I announced , but they ran like rabbits . They are all over Hampshire .  I laughed indulgently . I could afford an attitude of tolerant amusement towards the enemy .  Will they come back ?  Possibly . And in that case--I felt in my left-hand coat-pocket--I had better be getting ready . I felt in my right-hand coat-pocket . Ready , I repeated blankly . A clammy coldness took possession of me . My voice trailed off into nothingness . For in neither pocket was There a single one of the shells with which I had fancied that I was abundantly provided . In moments of excitement man is apt to make mistakes . I had made mine when , starting out on the sortie , I had left all my ammunition in the house .   II  I should like to think that it was an unselfish desire to spare my companions anxiety that made me keep my discovery to myself . But I am afraid that my reticence was due far more to the fact that I shrank from letting the Nugget discover my imbecile carelessness . Even in times of peril one retains ones human weaknesses; and I felt that I could not face his comments . If he had permitted a certain note of querulousness to creep into his conversation already , the imagination recoiled from the thought of the caustic depths he would reach now should I reveal the truth .  I tried to make things better with cheery optimism .  They wont come back! I said stoutly , and tried to believe it .  The Nugget as usual struck the jarring note .  Well , then , lets beat it , he said . I dont want to spend the night in this darned icehouse . I tell you Im catching cold . My chests weak . If youre so dead certain youve scared them away , lets quit .  I was not prepared to go as far as this .  They may be somewhere near , hiding .  Well , what if they are ? I dont mind being kidnapped . Lets go .  I think we ought to wait , said Audrey .  Of course , I said . It would be madness to go out now .  Oh , pshaw! said the Little Nugget; and from this point onwards punctuated the proceedings with a hacking cough .  I had never really believed that my demonstration had brought the siege to a definite end . I anticipated that there would be some delay before the renewal of hostilities , but I was too well acquainted with Buck MacGinniss tenacity to imagine that he would abandon his task because a few random shots had spread momentary panic in his ranks . He had all the night before him , and sooner or later he would return .  I had judged him correctly . Many minutes dragged wearily by without a sign from the enemy , then , listening at the window , I heard footsteps crossing the yard and voices talking in cautious undertones . The fight was on once more .  A bright light streamed through the window , flooding the opening and spreading in a wide circle on the ceiling . It was not difficult to understand what had happened . They had gone to the automobile and come back with one of the head-lamps , an astute move in which I seemed to see the finger of Sam . The danger-spot thus rendered harmless , they renewed their attack on the door with a reckless vigour . The mallet had been superseded by some heavier instrument--of iron this time . I think it must have been the jack from the automobile . It was a more formidable weapon altogether than the mallet , and even our good oak door quivered under it .  A splintering of wood decided me that the time had come to retreat to our second line of entrenchments . How long the door would hold it was impossible to say , but I doubted if it was more than a matter of minutes .  Relighting my candle , which I had extinguished from motives of economy , I caught Audreys eye and jerked my head towards the ladder .  You go first , I whispered .  The Nugget watched her disappear through the trap-door , then turned to me with an air of resolution .  If you think youre going to get me up there , youve another guess coming . Im going to wait here till they get in , and let them take me . Im about tired of this foolishness .  It was no time for verbal argument . I collected him , a kicking handful , bore him to the ladder , and pushed him through the opening . He uttered one of his devastating squeals . The sound seemed to encourage the workers outside like a trumpet-blast . The blows on the door redoubled .  I climbed the ladder and shut the trap-door behind me .  The air of the loft was close and musty and smelt of mildewed hay . It was not the sort of spot which one would have selected of ones own free will to sit in for any length of time . There was a rustling noise , and a rat scurried across the rickety floor , drawing a startled gasp from Audrey and a disgusted Oh , piffle! from the Nugget . Whatever merits this final refuge might have as a stronghold , it was beyond question a noisome place .  The beating on the stable-door was working up to a crescendo . Presently there came a crash that shook the floor on which we sat and sent our neighbours , the rats , scuttling to and fro in a perfect frenzy of perturbation . The light of the automobile lamp poured in through the numerous holes and chinks which the passage of time had made in the old boards . There was one large hole near the centre which produced a sort of searchlight effect , and allowed us for the first time to see what manner of place it was in which we had entrenched ourselves . The loft was high and spacious . The roof must have been some seven feet above our heads . I could stand upright without difficulty .  In the proceedings beneath us there had come a lull . The mystery of our disappearance had not baffled the enemy for long , for almost immediately the rays of the lamp had shifted and begun to play on the trap-door . I heard somebody climb the ladder , and the trap-door creaked gently as a hand tested it . I had taken up a position beside it , ready , if the bolt gave way , to do what I could with the butt of my pistol , my only weapon . But the bolt , though rusty , was strong , and the man dropped to the ground again . Since then , except for occasional snatches of whispered conversation , I had heard nothing .  Suddenly Sams voice spoke .  Mr Burns!  I saw no advantage in remaining silent .  Well ?  Havent you had enough of this ? Youve given us a mighty good run for our money , but you can see for yourself that youre through now . Id hate like anything for you to get hurt . Pass the kid down , and well call it off .  He paused .  Well ? he said . Why dont you answer ?  I did .  Did you ? I didnt hear you .  I smiled .  You mean to stick it out ? Dont be foolish , sonny . The boys here are mad enough at you already . Whats the use of getting yourself in bad for nothing ? Weve got you in a pocket . I know all about that gun of yours , young fellow . I had a suspicion what had happened , and Ive been into the house and found the shells you forgot to take with you . So , if you were thinking of making a bluff in that direction forget it!  The exposure had the effect I had anticipated .  Of all the chumps! exclaimed the Nugget caustically . You ought to be in a home . Well , I guess youll agree to end this foolishness now ? Lets go down and get it over and have some peace . Im getting pneumonia .  Youre quite right , Mr Fisher , I said . But dont forget I still have the pistol , even if I havent the shells . The first man who tries to come up here will have a headache tomorrow .  I shouldnt bank on it , sonny . Come along , kiddo! Youre done . Be good , and own it . We cant wait much longer .  Youll have to try .  Bucks voice broke in on the discussion , quite unintelligible except that it was obviously wrathful .  Oh well! I heard Sam say resignedly , and then there was silence again below .  I resumed my watch over the trap-door , encouraged . This parleying , I thought , was an admission of failure on the part of the besiegers . I did not credit Sam with a real concern for my welfare--thereby doing him an injustice . I can see now that he spoke perfectly sincerely . The position , though I was unaware of it , really was hopeless , for the reason that , like most positions , it had a flank as well as a front . In estimating the possibilities of attack , I had figured assaults as coming only from below . I had omitted from my calculations the fact that the loft had a roof .  It was a scraping on the tiles above my head that first brought the new danger-point to my notice . There followed the sound of heavy hammering , and with it came a sickening realization of the truth of what Sam had said . We were beaten .  I was too paralysed by the unexpectedness of the attack to form any plan; and , indeed , I do not think that there was anything that I could have done . I was unarmed and helpless . I stood there , waiting for the inevitable .  Affairs moved swiftly . Plaster rained down on to the wooden floor . I was vaguely aware that the Nugget was speaking , but I did not listen to him .  A gap appeared in the roof and widened . I could hear the heavy breathing of the man as he wrenched at the tiles .  And then the climax arrived , with anticlimax following so swiftly upon it that the two were almost simultaneous . I saw the worker on the roof cautiously poise himself in the opening , hunched up like some strange ape . The next moment he had sprung .  As his feet touched the floor there came a rending , splintering crash; the air was filled with a choking dust , and he was gone . The old worn out boards had shaken under my tread . They had given way in complete ruin beneath this sharp onslaught . The rays of the lamp , which had filtered in like pencils of light through crevices , now shone in a great lake in the centre of the floor .  In the stable below all was confusion . Everybody was speaking at once . The hero of the late disaster was groaning horribly , for which he certainly had good reason: I did not know the extent of his injuries , but a man does not do that sort of thing with impunity . The next of the strange happenings of the night now occurred .  I had not been giving the Nugget a great deal of my attention for some time , other and more urgent matters occupying me .  His action at this juncture , consequently , came as a complete and crushing surprise .  I was edging my way cautiously towards the jagged hole in the centre of the floor , in the hope of seeing something of what was going on below , when from close beside me his voice screamed . Its me , Ogden Ford . Im coming! and , without further warning , he ran to the hole , swung himself over , and dropped .  Manna falling from the skies in the wilderness never received a more whole-hearted welcome . Howls and cheers and ear-splitting whoops filled the air . The babel of talk broke out again . Some exuberant person found expression of his joy in emptying his pistol at the ceiling , to my acute discomfort , the spot he had selected as a target chancing to be within a foot of where I stood . Then they moved off in a body , still cheering . The fight was over .  I do not know how long it was before I spoke . It may have been some minutes . I was dazed with the swiftness with which the final stages of the drama had been played out . If I had given him more of my attention , I might have divined that Ogden had been waiting his opportunity to make some such move; but , as it was , the possibility had not even occurred to me , and I was stunned .  In the distance I heard the automobile moving off down the drive . The sound roused me .  Well , we may as well go , I said dully . I lit the candle and held it up . Audrey was standing against the wall , her face white and set .  I raised the trap-door and followed her down the ladder .  The rain had ceased , and the stars were shining . After the closeness of the loft , the clean wet air was delicious . For a moment we stopped , held by the peace and stillness of the night .  Then , quite suddenly , she broke down .  It was the unexpectedness of it that first threw me off my balance . In all the time I had known her , I had never before seen Audrey in tears . Always , in the past , she had borne the blows of fate with a stoical indifference which had alternately attracted and repelled me , according as my mood led me to think it courage or insensibility . In the old days , it had done much , this trait of hers , to rear a barrier between us . It had made her seem aloof and unapproachable . Subconsciously , I suppose , it had offended my egoism that she should be able to support herself in times of trouble , and not feel it necessary to lean on me .  And now the barrier had fallen . The old independence , the almost aggressive self-reliance , had vanished . A new Audrey had revealed herself .  She was sobbing helplessly , standing quite still , her arms hanging and her eyes staring blankly before her . There was something in her attitude so hopeless , so beaten , that the pathos of it seemed to cut me like a knife .  Audrey!  The stars glittered in the little pools among the worn flagstones . The night was very still . Only the steady drip of water from the trees broke the silence .  A great wave of tenderness seemed to sweep from my mind everything in the world but her . Everything broke abruptly that had been checking me , stifling me , holding me gagged and bound since the night when our lives had come together again after those five long years . I forgot Cynthia , my promise , everything .  Audrey!  She was in my arms , clinging to me , murmuring my name . The darkness was about us like a cloud .  And then she had slipped from me , and was gone .     Chapter 16   In my recollections of that strange night there are wide gaps . Trivial incidents come back to me with extraordinary vividness; while there are hours of which I can remember nothing . What I did or where I went I cannot recall . It seems to me , looking back , that I walked without a pause till morning; yet , when day came , I was still in the school grounds . Perhaps I walked , as a wounded animal runs , in circles . I lost , I know , all count of time . I became aware of the dawn as something that had happened suddenly , as if light had succeeded darkness in a flash . It had been night; I looked about me , and it was day--a steely , cheerless day , like a December evening . And I found that I was very cold , very tired , and very miserable .  My mind was like the morning , grey and overcast . Conscience may be expelled , but , like Nature , it will return . Mine , which I had cast from me , had crept back with the daylight . I had had my hour of freedom , and it was now for me to pay for it .  I paid in full . My thoughts tore me . I could see no way out . Through the night the fever and exhilaration of that mad moment had sustained me , but now the morning had come , when dreams must yield to facts , and I had to face the future .  I sat on the stump of a tree , and buried my face in my hands . I must have fallen asleep , for , when I raised my eyes again , the day was brighter . Its cheerlessness had gone . The sky was blue , and birds were singing .  It must have been about half an hour later that the first beginnings of a plan of action came to me . I could not trust myself to reason out my position clearly and honestly in this place where Audreys spell was over everything . The part of me that was struggling to be loyal to Cynthia was overwhelmed here . London called to me . I could think there , face my position quietly , and make up my mind .  I turned to walk to the station . I could not guess even remotely what time it was . The sun was shining through the trees , but in the road outside the grounds there were no signs of workers beginning the day .  It was half past five when I reached the station . A sleepy porter informed me that there would be a train to London , a slow train , at six .         *       *       *       *       *  I remained in London two days , and on the third went down to Sanstead to see Audrey for the last time . I had made my decision .  I found her on the drive , close by the gate . She turned at my footstep on the gravel; and , as I saw her , I knew that the fight which I had thought over was only beginning .  I was shocked at her appearance . Her face was very pale , and there were tired lines about her eyes .  I could not speak . Something choked me . Once again , as on that night in the stable-yard , the world and all that was in it seemed infinitely remote .  It was she who broke the silence .  Well , Peter , she said listlessly .  We walked up the drive together .  Have you been to London ?  Yes . I came down this morning . I paused . I went there to think , I said .  She nodded .  I have been thinking , too .  I stopped , and began to hollow out a groove in the wet gravel with my heel . Words were not coming readily .  Suddenly she found speech . She spoke quickly , but her voice was dull and lifeless .  Let us forget what has happened , Peter . We were neither of us ourselves . I was tired and frightened and disappointed . You were sorry for me just at the moment , and your nerves were strained , like mine . It was all nothing . Let us forget it .  I shook my head .  No , I said . It was not that . I cant let you even pretend you think that was all . I love you . I always have loved you , though I did not know how much till you had gone away . After a time , I thought I had got over it . But when I met you again down here , I knew that I had not , and never should . I came back to say good-bye , but I shall always love you . It is my punishment for being the sort of man I was five years ago .  And mine for being the sort of woman I was five years ago . She laughed bitterly . Woman! I was just a little fool , a sulky child . My punishment is going to be worse than yours , Peter . You will not be always thinking that you had the happiness of two lives in your hands , and threw it away because you had not the sense to hold it .  It is just that that I shall always be thinking . What happened five years ago was my fault , Audrey , and nobodys but mine . I dont think that , even when the loss of you hurt most , I ever blamed you for going away . You had made me see myself as I was , and I knew that you had done the right thing . I was selfish , patronizing--I was insufferable . It was I who threw away our happiness . You put it in a sentence that first day here , when you said that I had been kind--sometimes--when I happened to think of it . That summed me up . You have nothing to reproach yourself for . I think we have not had the best of luck; but all the blame is mine .  A flush came into her pale face .  I remember saying that . I said it because I was afraid of myself . I was shaken by meeting you again . I thought you must be hating me--you had every reason to hate me , and you spoke as if you did--and I did not want to show you what you were to me . It wasnt true , Peter . Five years ago I may have thought it , but not now . I have grown to understand the realities by this time . I have been through too much to have any false ideas left . I have had some chance to compare men , and I realize that they are not all kind , Peter , even sometimes , when they happen to think of it .  Audrey , I said--I had never found myself able to ask the question before--was--was--he--was Sheridan kind to you ?  She did not speak for a moment , and I thought she was resenting the question .  No! she said abruptly .  She shot out the monosyllable with a force that startled and silenced me . There was a whole history of unhappiness in the word .  No , she said again , after a pause , more gently this time . I understood . She was speaking of a dead man .  I cant talk about him , she went on hurriedly . I expect most of it was my fault . I was unhappy because he was not you , and he saw that I was unhappy and hated me for it . We had nothing in common . It was just a piece of sheer madness , our marriage . He swept me off my feet . I never had a great deal of sense , and I lost it all then . I was far happier when he had left me .  Left you ?  He deserted me almost directly we reached America . She laughed . I told you I had grown to understand the realities . I began then .  I was horrified . For the first time I realized vividly all that she had gone through . When she had spoken to me before of her struggles that evening over the study fire , I had supposed that they had begun only after her husbands death , and that her life with him had in some measure trained her for the fight . That she should have been pitched into the arena , a mere child , with no experience of life , appalled me . And , as she spoke , there came to me the knowledge that now I could never do what I had come to do . I could not give her up . She needed me . I tried not to think of Cynthia .  I took her hand .  Audrey , I said , I came here to say good-bye . I cant . I want you . Nothing matters except you . I wont give you up .  Its too late , she said , with a little catch in her voice . You are engaged to Mrs Ford .  I am engaged , but not to Mrs Ford . I am engaged to someone you have never met--Cynthia Drassilis .  She pulled her hand away quickly , wide-eyed , and for some moments was silent .  Do you love her ? she asked at last .  No .  Does she love you ?  Cynthias letter rose before my eyes , that letter that could have had no meaning , but one .  I am afraid she does , I said .  She looked at me steadily . Her face was very pale .  You must marry her , Peter .  I shook my head .  You must . She believes in you .  I cant . I want you . And you need me . Can you deny that you need me ?  No .  She said it quite simply , without emotion . I moved towards her , thrilling , but she stepped back .  She needs you too , she said .  A dull despair was creeping over me . I was weighed down by a premonition of failure . I had fought my conscience , my sense of duty and honour , and crushed them . She was raising them up against me once more . My self-control broke down .  Audrey , I cried , for Gods sake cant you see what youre doing ? We have been given a second chance . Our happiness is in your hands again , and you are throwing it away . Why should we make ourselves wretched for the whole of our lives ? What does anything else matter except that we love each other ? Why should we let anything stand in our way ? I wont give you up .  She did not answer . Her eyes were fixed on the ground . Hope began to revive in me , telling me that I had persuaded her . But when she looked up it was with the same steady gaze , and my heart sank again .  Peter , she said , I want to tell you something . It will make you understand , I think . I havent been honest , Peter . I have not fought fairly . All these weeks , ever since we met , I have been trying to steal you . Its the only word . I have tried every little miserable trick I could think of to steal you from the girl you had promised to marry . And she wasnt here to fight for herself . I didnt think of her . I was wrapped up in my own selfishness . And then , after that night , when you had gone away , I thought it all out . I had a sort of awakening . I saw the part I had been playing . Even then I tried to persuade myself that I had done something rather fine . I thought , you see , at that time that you were infatuated with Mrs Ford--and I know Mrs Ford . If she is capable of loving any man , she loves Mr Ford , though they are divorced . I knew she would only make you unhappy . I told myself I was saving you . Then you told me it was not Mrs Ford , but this girl . That altered everything . Dont you see that I cant let you give her up now ? You would despise me . I shouldnt feel clean . I should feel as if I had stabbed her in the back .  I forced a laugh . It rang hollow against the barrier that separated us . In my heart I knew that this barrier was not to be laughed away .  Cant you see , Peter ? You must see .  I certainly dont . I think youre overstrained , and that you have let your imagination run away with you . I--  She interrupted me .  Do you remember that evening in the study ? she asked abruptly . We had been talking . I had been telling you how I had lived during those five years .  I remember .  Every word I spoke was spoken with an object--calculated . . . . Yes , even the pauses . I tried to make them tell , too . I knew you , you see , Peter . I knew you through and through , because I loved you , and I knew the effect those tales would have on you . Oh , they were all true . I was honest as far as that goes . But they had the mean motive at the back of them . I was playing on your feelings . I knew how kind you were , how you would pity me . I set myself to create an image which would stay in your mind and kill the memory of the other girl; the image of a poor , ill-treated little creature who should work through to your heart by way of your compassion . I knew you , Peter , I knew you . And then I did a meaner thing still . I pretended to stumble in the dark . I meant you to catch me and hold me , and you did . And  . . .  Her voice broke off .  Im glad I have told you , she said . It makes it a little better . You understand now how I feel , dont you ?  She held out her hand .  Good-bye .  I am not going to give you up , I said doggedly .  Good-bye , she said again . Her voice was a whisper .  I took her hand and began to draw her towards me .  It is not good-bye . There is no one else in the world but you , and I am not going to give you up .  Peter! she struggled feebly . Oh , let me go .  I drew her nearer .  I wont let you go , I said .  But , as I spoke , there came the sound of automobile wheels on the gravel . A large red car was coming up the drive . I dropped Audreys hand , and she stepped back and was lost in the shrubbery . The car slowed down and stopped beside me . There were two women in the tonneau . One , who was dark and handsome , I did not know . The other was Mrs Drassilis .     Chapter 17   I was given no leisure for wondering how Cynthias mother came to be in the grounds of Sanstead House , for her companion , almost before the car had stopped , jumped out and clutched me by the arm , at the same time uttering this cryptic speech: Whatever he offers Ill double!  She fixed me , as she spoke , with a commanding eye . She was a woman , I gathered in that instant , born to command . There seemed , at any rate , no doubt in her mind that she could command me . If I had been a black beetle she could not have looked at me with a more scornful superiority . Her eyes were very large and of a rich , fiery brown colour , and it was these that gave me my first suspicion of her identity . As to the meaning of her words , however , I had no clue .  Bear that in mind , she went on . Ill double it if its a million dollars .  Im afraid I dont understand , I said , finding speech .  She clicked her tongue impatiently .  Theres no need to be so cautious and mysterious . This lady is a friend of mine . She knows all about it . I asked her to come . Im Mrs Elmer Ford . I came here directly I got your letter . I think youre the lowest sort of scoundrel that ever managed to keep out of gaol , but that neednt make any difference just now . Were here to talk business , Mr Fisher , so we may as well begin .  I was getting tired of being taken for Smooth Sam .  I am not Smooth Sam Fisher .  I turned to the automobile . Will you identify me , Mrs Drassilis ?  She was regarding me with wide-open eyes .  What on earth are you doing down here ? I have been trying everywhere to find you , but nobody--  Mrs Ford interrupted her . She gave me the impression of being a woman who wanted a good deal of the conversation , and who did not care how she got it . In a conversational sense she thugged Mrs Drassilis at this point , or rather she swept over her like some tidal wave , blotting her out .  Oh , she said fixing her brown eyes , less scornful now but still imperious , on mine . I must apologize . I have made a mistake . I took you for a low villain of the name of Sam Fisher . I hope you will forgive me . I was to have met him at this exact spot just about this time , by appointment , so , seeing you here , I mistook you for him .  If I might have a word with you alone ? I said .  Mrs Ford had a short way with people . In matters concerning her own wishes , she took their acquiescence for granted .  Drive on up to the house , Jarvis , she said , and Mrs Drassilis was whirled away round the curve of the drive before she knew what had happened to her .  Well ?  My name is Burns , I said .  Now I understand , she said . I know who you are now . She paused , and I was expecting her to fawn upon me for my gallant service in her cause , when she resumed in quite a different strain .  I cant think what you can have been about , Mr Burns , not to have been able to do what Cynthia asked you . Surely in all these weeks and months . . . . And then , after all , to have let this Fisher scoundrel steal him away from under your nose . . .!  She gave me a fleeting glance of unfathomable scorn . And when I thought of all the sufferings I had gone through that term owing to her repulsive son and , indirectly , for her sake , I felt that the time had come to speak out .  May I describe the way in which I allowed your son to be stolen away from under my nose ? I said . And in well-chosen words , I sketched the outline of what had happened . I did not omit to lay stress on the fact that the Nuggets departure with the enemy was entirely voluntary .  She heard me out in silence .  That was too bad of Oggie , she said tolerantly , when I had ceased dramatically on the climax of my tale .  As a comment it seemed to me inadequate .  Oggie was always high-spirited , she went on . No doubt you have noticed that ?  A little .  He could be led , but never driven . With the best intentions , no doubt , you refused to allow him to leave the stables that night and return to the house , and he resented the check and took the matter into his own hands . She broke off and looked at her watch . Have you a watch ? What time is it ? Only that ? I thought it must be later . I arrived too soon . I got a letter from this man Fisher , naming this spot and this hour for a meeting , when we could discuss terms . He said that he had written to Mr Ford , appointing the same time . She frowned . I have no doubt he will come , she said coldly .  Perhaps this is his car , I said .  A second automobile was whirring up the drive . There was a shout as it came within sight of us , and the chauffeur put on the brake . A man sprang from the tonneau . He jerked a word to the chauffeur , and the car went on up the drive .  He was a massively built man of middle age , with powerful shoulders , and a face--when he had removed his motor-goggles very like any one of half a dozen of those Roman emperors whose features have come down to us on coins and statues , square-jawed , clean-shaven , and aggressive . Like his late wife (who was now standing , drawn up to her full height , staring haughtily at him) he had the air of one born to command . I should imagine that the married life of these two must have been something more of a battle even than most married lives . The clashing of those wills must have smacked of a collision between the immovable mass and the irresistible force .  He met Mrs Fords stare with one equally militant , then turned to me .  Ill give you double what she has offered you , he said . He paused , and eyed me with loathing . You damned scoundrel , he added .  Custom ought to have rendered me immune to irritation , but it had not . I spoke my mind .  One of these days , Mr Ford , I said , I am going to publish a directory of the names and addresses of the people who have mistaken me for Smooth Sam Fisher . I am not Sam Fisher . Can you grasp that ? My name is Peter Burns , and for the past term I have been a master at this school . And I may say that , judging from what I know of the little brute , any one who kidnapped your son as long as two days ago will be so anxious by now to get rid of him that he will probably want to pay you for taking him back .  My words almost had the effect of bringing this divorced couple together again . They made common cause against me . It was probably the first time in years that they had formed even a temporary alliance .  How dare you talk like that! said Mrs Ford . Oggie is a sweet boy in every respect .  Youre perfectly right , Nesta , said Mr Ford . He may want intelligent handling , but hes a mighty fine boy . I shall make inquiries , and if this man has been ill-treating Ogden , I shall complain to Mr Abney . Where the devil is this man Fisher ? he broke off abruptly .  On the spot , said an affable voice . The bushes behind me parted , and Smooth Sam stepped out on to the gravel .  I had recognized him by his voice . I certainly should not have done so by his appearance . He had taken the precaution of making up for this important meeting . A white wig of indescribable respectability peeped out beneath his black hat . His eyes twinkled from under two penthouses of white eyebrows . A white moustache covered his mouth . He was venerable to a degree .  He nodded to me , and bared his white head gallantly to Mrs Ford .  No worse for our little outing , Mr Burns , I am glad to see . Mrs Ford , I must apologize for my apparent unpunctuality , but I was not really behind time . I have been waiting in the bushes . I thought it just possible that you might have brought unwelcome members of the police force with you , and I have been scouting , as it were , before making my advance . I see , however , that all is well , and we can come at once to business . May I say , before we begin , that I overheard your recent conversation , and that I entirely disagree with Mr Burns . Master Ford is a charming boy . Already I feel like an elder brother to him . I am loath to part with him .  How much ? snapped Mr Ford . Youve got me . How much do you want ?  Ill give you double what he offers , cried Mrs Ford .  Sam held up his hand , his old pontifical manner intensified by the white wig .  May I speak ? Thank you . This is a little embarrassing . When I asked you both to meet me here , it was not for the purpose of holding an auction . I had a straight-forward business proposition to make to you . It will necessitate a certain amount of plain and somewhat personal speaking . May I proceed ? Thank you . I will be as brief as possible .  His eloquence appeared to have had a soothing effect on the two Fords . They remained silent .  You must understand , said Sam , that I am speaking as an expert . I have been in the kidnapping business many years , and I know what I am talking about . And I tell you that the moment you two got your divorce , you said good-bye to all peace and quiet . Bless you--Sams manner became fatherly--Ive seen it a hundred times . Couple get divorced , and , if theres a child , what happens ? They start in playing battledore-and-shuttlecock with him . Wife sneaks him from husband . Husband sneaks him back from wife . After a while along comes a gentleman in my line of business , a professional at the game , and he puts one across on both the amateurs . He takes advantage of the confusion , slips in , and gets away with the kid . Thats what has happened here , and Im going to show you the way to stop it another time . Now Ill make you a proposition . What you want to do--I have never heard anything so soothing , so suggestive of the old family friend healing an unfortunate breach , as Sams voice at this juncture--what you want to do is to get together again right quick . Never mind the past . Let bygones be bygones . Kiss and be friends .  A snort from Mr Ford checked him for a moment , but he resumed .  I guess there were faults on both sides . Get together and talk it over . And when youve agreed to call the fight off and start fair again , thats where I come in . Mr Burns here will tell you , if you ask him , that Im anxious to quit this business and marry and settle down . Well , see here . What you want to do is to give me a salary--we can talk figures later on--to stay by you and watch over the kid . Dont snort--Im talking plain sense . Youd a sight better have me with you than against you . Set a thief to catch a thief . What I dont know about the fine points of the game isnt worth knowing . Ill guarantee , if you put me in charge , to see that nobody comes within a hundred miles of the kid unless he has an order-to-view . Youll find I earn every penny of that salary  . . . Mr Burns and I will now take a turn up the drive while you think it over .  He linked his arm in mine and drew me away . As we turned the corner of the drive I caught a glimpse over my shoulder of the Little Nuggets parents . They were standing where we had left them , as if Sams eloquence had rooted them to the spot .  Well , well , well , young man , said Sam , eyeing me affectionately , its pleasant to meet you again , under happier conditions than last time . You certainly have all the luck , sonny , or you would have been badly hurt that night . I was getting scared how the thing would end . Bucks a plain roughneck , and his gang are as bad as he is , and they had got mighty sore at you , mighty sore . If they had grabbed you , theres no knowing what might not have happened . However , alls well that ends well , and this little game has surely had the happy ending . I shall get that job , sonny . Old man Ford isnt a fool , and it wont take him long , when he gets to thinking it over , to see that Im right . Hell hire me .  Arent you rather reckoning without your partner ? I said . Where does Buck MacGinnis come in on the deal ?  Sam patted my shoulder paternally .  He doesnt , sonny , he doesnt . It was a shame to do it--it was like taking candy from a kid--but business is business , and I was reluctantly compelled to double-cross poor old Buck . I sneaked the Nugget away from him next day . Its not worth talking about; it was too easy . Bucks all right in a rough-and-tumble , but when it comes to brains he gets left , and so hell go on through life , poor fellow . I hate to think of it .  He sighed . Bucks misfortunes seemed to move him deeply .  I shouldnt be surprised if he gave up the profession after this . He has had enough to discourage him . I told you about what happened to him that night , didnt I ? No ? I thought I did . Why , Buck was the guy who did the Steve Brodie through the roof; and , when we picked him up , we found hed broken his leg again! Isnt that enough to jar a man ? I guess hell retire from the business after that . He isnt intended for it .  We were approaching the two automobiles now , and , looking back , I saw Mr and Mrs Ford walking up the drive . Sam followed my gaze , and I heard him chuckle .  Its all right , he said . Theyve fixed it up . Something in the way theyre walking tells me theyve fixed it up .  Mrs Drassilis was still sitting in the red automobile , looking piqued but resigned . Mrs Ford addressed her .  I shall have to leave you , Mrs Drassilis , she said . Tell Jarvis to drive you wherever you want to go . I am going with my husband to see my boy Oggie .  She stretched out a hand towards the millionaire . He caught it in his , and they stood there , smiling foolishly at each other , while Sam , almost purring , brooded over them like a stout fairy queen . The two chauffeurs looked on woodenly .  Mr Ford released his wifes hand and turned to Sam .  Fisher .  Sir ?  Ive been considering your proposition . Theres a string tied to it .  Oh no , sir , I assure you!  There is . What guarantee have I that you wont double-cross me ?  Sam smiled , relieved .  You forget that I told you I was about to be married , sir . My wife wont let me!  Mr Ford waved his hand towards the automobile .  Jump in , he said briefly , and tell him where to drive to . Youre engaged!     Chapter 18   No manners! said Mrs Drassilis . None whatever . I always said so .  She spoke bitterly . She was following the automobile with an offended eye as it moved down the drive .  The car rounded the corner . Sam turned and waved a farewell . Mr and Mrs Ford , seated close together in the tonneau , did not even look round .  Mrs Drassilis sniffed disgustedly .  Shes a friend of Cynthias . Cynthia asked me to come down here with her to see you . I came , to oblige her . And now , without a word of apology , she leaves me stranded . She has no manners whatever .  I offered no defence of the absent one . The verdict more or less squared with my own opinion .  Is Cynthia back in England ? I asked , to change the subject .  The yacht got back yesterday . Peter , I have something of the utmost importance to speak to you about . She glanced at Jarvis the chauffeur , leaning back in his seat with the air , peculiar to chauffeurs in repose , of being stuffed . Walk down the drive with me .  I helped her out of the car , and we set off in silence . There was a suppressed excitement in my companions manner which interested me , and something furtive which brought back all my old dislike of her . I could not imagine what she could have to say to me that had brought her all these miles .  How do you come to be down here ? she said . When Cynthia told me you were here , I could hardly believe her . Why are you a master at this school ? I cannot understand it!  What did you want to see me about ? I asked .  She hesitated . It was always an effort for her to be direct . Now , apparently , the effort was too great . The next moment she had rambled off on some tortuous bypath of her own , which , though it presumably led in the end to her destination , was evidently a long way round .  I have known you for so many years now , Peter , and I dont know of anybody whose character I admire more . You are so generous--quixotic in fact . You are one of the few really unselfish men I have ever met . You are always thinking of other people . Whatever it cost you , I know you would not hesitate to give up anything if you felt that it was for someone elses happiness . I do admire you so for it . One meets so few young men nowadays who consider anybody except themselves .  She paused , either for breath or for fresh ideas , and I took advantage of the lull in the rain of bouquets to repeat my question .  What did you want to see me about ? I asked patiently .  About Cynthia . She asked me to see you .  Oh!  You got a letter from her .  Yes .  Last night , when she came home , she told me about it , and showed me your answer . It was a beautiful letter , Peter . Im sure I cried when I read it . And Cynthia did , I feel certain . Of course , to a girl of her character that letter was final . She is so loyal , dear child .  I dont understand .  As Sam would have said , she seemed to be speaking; words appeared to be fluttering from her; but her meaning was beyond me .  Once she has given her promise , I am sure nothing would induce her to break it , whatever her private feelings . She is so loyal . She has such character .  Would you mind being a little clearer ? I said sharply . I really dont understand what it is you are trying to tell me . What do you mean about loyalty and character ? I dont understand .  She was not to be hustled from her bypath . She had chosen her route , and she meant to travel by it , ignoring short-cuts .  To Cynthia , as I say , it was final . She simply could not see that the matter was not irrevocably settled . I thought it so fine of her . But I am her mother , and it was my duty not to give in and accept the situation as inevitable while there was anything I could do for her happiness . I knew your chivalrous , unselfish nature , Peter . I could speak to you as Cynthia could not . I could appeal to your generosity in a way impossible , of course , for her . I could put the whole facts of the case clearly before you .  I snatched at the words .  I wish you would . What are they ?  She rambled off again .  She has such a rigid sense of duty . There is no arguing with her . I told her that , if you knew , you would not dream of standing in her way . You are so generous , such a true friend , that your only thought would be for her . If her happiness depended on your releasing her from her promise , you would not think of yourself . So in the end I took matters into my own hands and came to see you . I am truly sorry for you , dear Peter , but to me Cynthias happiness , of course , must come before everything . You do understand , dont you ?  Gradually , as she was speaking , I had begun to grasp hesitatingly at her meaning , hesitatingly , because the first hint of it had stirred me to such a whirl of hope that I feared to risk the shock of finding that , after all , I had been mistaken . If I were right--and surely she could mean nothing else--I was free , free with honour . But I could not live on hints . I must hear this thing in words .  Has--has Cynthia-- I stopped , to steady my voice . Has Cynthia found-- I stopped again . I was finding it absurdly difficult to frame my sentence . Is there someone else ? I concluded with a rush .  Mrs Drassilis patted my arm sympathetically .  Be brave , Peter!  There is ?  Yes .  The trees , the drive , the turf , the sky , the birds , the house , the automobile , and Jarvis , the stuffed chauffeur , leaped together for an instant in one whirling , dancing mass of which I was the centre . And then , out of the chaos , as it separated itself once more into its component parts , I heard my voice saying , Tell me .  The world was itself again , and I was listening quietly and with a mild interest which , try as I would , I could not make any stronger . I had exhausted my emotion on the essential fact: the details were an anticlimax .  I liked him directly I saw him , said Mrs Drassilis . And , of course , as he was such a friend of yours , we naturally--  A friend of mine ?  I am speaking of Lord Mountry .  Mountry ? What about him ? Light flooded in on my numbed brain . You dont mean--Is it Lord Mountry ?  My manner must have misled her . She stammered in her eagerness to dispel what she took to be my misapprehension .  Dont think that he acted in anything but the most honourable manner . Nothing could be farther from the truth . He knew nothing of Cynthias engagement to you . She told him when he asked her to marry him , and he--as a matter of fact , it was he who insisted on dear Cynthia writing that letter to you .  She stopped , apparently staggered by this excursion into honesty .  Well ?  In fact , he dictated it .  Oh!  Unfortunately , it was quite the wrong sort of letter . It was the very opposite of clear . It can have given you no inkling of the real state of affairs .  It certainly did not .  He would not allow her to alter it in any way . He is very obstinate at times , like so many shy men . And when your answer came , you see , things were worse than before .  I suppose so .  I could see last night how unhappy they both were . And when Cynthia suggested it , I agreed at once to come to you and tell you everything .  She looked at me anxiously . From her point of view , this was the climax , the supreme moment . She hesitated . I seemed to see her marshalling her forces , the telling sentences , the persuasive adjectives; rallying them together for the grand assault .  But through the trees I caught a glimpse of Audrey , walking on the lawn; and the assault was never made .  I will write to Cynthia tonight , I said , wishing her happiness .  Oh , Peter! said Mrs Drassilis .  Dont mention it , said I .  Doubts appeared to mar her perfect contentment .  You are sure you can convince her ?  Convince her ?  And--er--Lord Mountry . He is so determined not to do anything--er--what he would call unsportsmanlike .  Perhaps I had better tell her I am going to marry some one else , I suggested .  I think that would be an excellent idea , she said , brightening visibly . How clever of you to have thought of it .  She permitted herself a truism .  After all , dear Peter , there are plenty of nice girls in the world . You have only to look for them .  Youre perfectly right , I said . Ill start at once .  A gleam of white caught my eye through the trees by the lawn . I moved towards it . Chapter 1   The signals from space began a little after midnight , local time , on a Friday . They were first picked up in the South Pacific , just westward of the International Date Line . A satellite-watching station on an island named Kalua was the first to receive them , though nobody heard the first four or five minutes . But it is certain that the very first message was picked up and recorded by the monitor instruments .  The satellite-tracking unit on Kalua was practically a duplicate of all its fellows . There was the station itself with a vertical antenna outside pointing at the stars . There were various lateral antennae held two feet above ground by concrete posts . In the instrument room in the building a light burned over a desk , three or four monitor lights glowed dimly to indicate that the self-recording instruments were properly operating , and there was a multiple-channel tape recorder built into the wall . Its twin tape reels turned sedately , winding a brown plastic ribbon from one to the other at a moderate pace .  The staff man on duty had gone to the installations kitchen for a cup of coffee . No sound originated in the room , unless one counted the fluttering of a piece of weighted-down paper on the desk . Outside , palm trees whispered and rustled their long fronds in the southeast trade wind under a sky full of glittering stars . Beyond , there was the dull booming of surf upon the barrier reef of the island . But the instruments made no sound . Only the tape reels moved .  The signals began abruptly . They came out of a speaker and were instantly recorded . They were elfin and flutelike and musical . They were crisp and distinct . They did not form a melody , but nearly all the components of melody were there . Pure musical notes , each with its own pitch , all of different lengths , like quarter-notes and eighth-notes in music . The sounds needed only rhythm and arrangement to form a plaintive tune .  Nothing happened . The sounds continued for something over a minute . They stopped long enough to seem to have ended . Then they began again .  When the staff man came back into the room with a coffee cup in his hand , he heard the flutings instantly . His jaw dropped . He said , What the hell ? and went to look at the instruments . He spilled some of his coffee when he saw their readings .  The tracking dials said that the signals came from a stationary source almost directly overhead . If they were from a stationary source , no plane was transmitting them . Nor could they be coming from an artificial satellite . A plane would move at a moderate pace across the sky . A satellite would move faster . Much faster . This source , according to the instruments , did not move at all .  The staff man listened with a blank expression on his face . There was but one rational explanation , which he did not credit for an instant . The reasonable answer would have been that somebody , somewhere , had put a satellite out into an orbit requiring twenty-four hours for a circuit of the earth , instead of the ninety to one-hundred-twenty-four-minute orbits of the satellites known to sweep around the world from west to east and pole to pole . But the piping , musical sounds were not the sort of thing that modern physicists would have contrived to carry information about cosmic-particle frequency , space temperature , micrometeorites , and the like .  The signals stopped again , and again resumed . The staff man was galvanized into activity . He rushed to waken other members of the outpost . When he got back , the signals continued for a minute and stopped altogether . But they were recorded on tape , with the instrument readings that had been made during their duration . The staff man played the tape back for his companions .  They felt as he did . These were signals from space where man had never been . They had listened to the first message ever to reach mankind from the illimitable emptiness between the stars and planets . Man was not alone . Man was no longer isolated . Man . . . .  The staff of the tracking station was very much upset . Most of the men were white-faced by the time the taped message had been re-played through to its end . They were frightened .  Considering everything , they had every reason to be .  The second pick-up was in Darjeeling , in northern India . The Indian government was then passing through one of its periods of enthusiastic interest in science . It had set up a satellite-observation post in a former British cavalry stable on the outskirts of the town . The acting head of the observing staff happened to hear the second broadcast to reach Earth . It arrived some seventy-nine minutes after the first reception , and it was picked up by two stations , Kalua and Darjeeling .  The Darjeeling observer was incredulous at what he heard--five repetitions of the same sequence of flutelike notes . After each pause--when it seemed that the signals had stopped before they actually did so--the reception was exactly the same as the one before . It was inconceivable that such a succession of sounds , lasting a full minute , could be exactly repeated by any natural chain of events . Five repetitions were out of the question . The notes were signals . They were a communication which was repeated to be sure it was received .  The third broadcast was heard in Lebanon in addition to Kalua and Darjeeling . Reception in all three places was simultaneous . A signal from a nearby satellite could not possibly have been picked up so far around the Earths curvature . The widening of the area of reception , too , proved that there was no new satellite aloft with an orbit period of exactly twenty-four hours , so that it hung motionless in the sky relative to Earth . Tracking observations , in fact , showed the source of the signals to move westward , as time passed , with the apparent motion of a star . No satellite of Earth could possibly exist with such an orbit unless it was close enough to show a detectable parallax . This did not .  A French station picked up the next batch of plaintive sounds . Kalua , Darjeeling , and Lebanon still received . By the time the next signal was due , Croydon , in England , had its giant radar-telescope trained on the part of the sky from which all the tracking stations agreed the signals came .  Croydon painstakingly made observations during four seventy-nine-minute intervals and four five-minute receptions of the fluting noises . It reported that there was a source of artificial signals at an extremely great distance , position right ascension so-and-so , declination such-and-such . The signals began every seventy-nine minutes . They could be heard by any receiving instrument capable of handling the microwave frequency involved . The broadcast was extremely broad-band . It covered more than two octaves and sharp tuning was not necessary . A man-made signal would have been confined to as narrow a wave-band as possible , to save power for one reason , so it could not be imagined that the signal was anything but artificial . Yet no Earth science could have sent a transmitter out so far .  When sunrise arrived at the tracking station on Kalua , it ceased to receive from space . On the other hand , tracking stations in the United States , the Antilles , and South America began to pick up the cryptic sounds .  The first released news of the happening was broadcast in the United States . In the South Pacific and India and the Near East and Europe , the whole matter seemed too improbable for the notification of the public . News pressure in the United States , though , is very great . Here the news rated broadcast , and got it .  That was why Joe Burke did not happen to complete the business for which hed taken Sandy Lund to a suitable , romantic spot . She was his secretary and the only permanent employee in the highly individual business hed begun and operated . Hed known her all his life , and it seemed to him that for most of it hed wanted to marry her . But something had happened to him when he was quite a small boy--and still happened at intervals--which interposed a mental block . Hed always wanted to be romantic with her , but there was a matter of two moons in a strange-starred sky , and trees with foliage like none on Earth , and an overwhelming emotion . There was no rational explanation for it . There could be none . Often hed told himself that Sandy was real and utterly desirable , and this lunatic repetitive experience was at worst insanity and at the least delusion . But hed never been able to do more than stammer when talk between them went away from matter-of-fact things .  Tonight , though , hed parked his car where a river sparkled in the moonlight . There was a scent of pine and arbutus in the air and a faint thread of romantic music came from his cars radio . Hed brought Sandy here to propose to her . He was doggedly resolved to break the chains a psychological oddity had tied him up in .  He cleared his throat . Hed taken Sandy out to dinner , ostensibly to celebrate the completion of a development job for Interiors , Inc . Burke had started Burke Development , Inc . , some four years out of college when he found he didnt like working for other people and could work for himself . Its function was to develop designs and processes for companies too small to have research-and-development divisions of their own . The latest , now-finished , job was a wall-garden which those expensive interior decorators , Interiors , Inc . , believed might appeal to the very rich . Burke had made it . It was a hydroponic job . A rich mans house could have one or more walls which looked like a grassy sward stood on edge , with occasional small flowers or even fruits growing from its close-clipped surface .[A]       [Footnote A: Transcribers Note: The following sentence has been      deleted at this point: Interiors , Inc . , would push the idea of a      a bomb shelter or in an atomic submarine where it would cation .      This is a possible printer error .  A later edition of this work      also has this sentence deleted .  It was done . A production-job room-wall had been shipped and the check for it banked . Burke had toyed with the idea that growing vegetation like that might be useful in a bomb shelter or in an atomic submarine where it would keep the air fresh indefinitely . But such ideas were for the future . They had nothing to do with now . Now Burke was going to triumph over an obsessive dream .  Ive got something to say , Sandy , said Burke painfully .  She did not turn her head . There was moonlight , rippling water , and the tranquil noises of the night in springtime . A perfect setting for what Burke had in mind , and what Sandy knew about in advance . She waited , her eyes turned away from him so he wouldnt see that they were shining a little .  Im something of an idiot , said Burke , clumsily . Its only fair to tell you about it . Im subject to a psychological gimmick that a girl I--Hm . He coughed . I think I ought to tell you about it .  Why ? asked Sandy , still not looking in his direction .  Because I want to be fair , said Burke . Im a sort of crackpot . Youve noticed it , of course .  Sandy considered .  No-o-o-o , she said measuredly . I think youre pretty normal , except--No . I think youre all right .  Unfortunately , he told her , Im not . Ever since I was a kid Ive been bothered by a delusion , if thats what it is . It doesnt make sense . It couldnt . But it made me take up engineering , I think , and  . . .  His voice trailed away .  And what ?  Made an idiot out of me , said Burke . I was always pretty crazy about you , and it seems to me that I took you to a lot of dances and such in high school , but I couldnt act romantic . I wanted to , but I couldnt . There was this crazy delusion . . . .  I wondered , a little , said Sandy , smiling .  I wanted to be romantic about you , he told her urgently . But this damned obsession kept me from it .  Are you offering to be a brother to me now ? asked Sandy .  No! said Burke explosively . Im fed up with myself . I want to be different . Very different . With you!  Sandy smiled again .  Strangely enough , you interest me , she told him . Do go on!  But he was abruptly tongue-tied . He looked at her , struggling to speak . She waited .  I w-want to ask you to m-m-marry me , said Burke desperately . But I have to tell you about the other thing first . Maybe you wont want . . . .  Her eyes were definitely shining now . There was soft music and rippling water and soft wind in the trees . It was definitely the time and place for romance .  But the music on the car radio cut off abruptly . A harsh voice interrupted:  Special Bulletin! Special Bulletin! Messages of unknown origin are reaching Earth from outer space! Special Bulletin! Messages from outer space!  Burke reached over and turned up the sound . Perhaps he was the only man in the world who would have spoiled such a moment to listen to a news broadcast , and even he wouldnt have done it for a broadcast on any other subject . He turned the sound high .  This is a special broadcast from the Academy of Sciences in Washington , D . C . boomed the speaker . Some thirteen hours ago a satellite-tracking station in the South Pacific reported picking up signals of unknown origin and great strength , using the microwave frequencies also used by artificial satellites now in orbit around Earth . The report was verified shortly afterward from India , then Near East tracking stations made the same report . European listening posts and radar telescopes were on the alert when the sky area from which the signals come rose above the horizon . American stations have again verified the report within the last few minutes . Artificial signals , plainly not made by men , are now reaching Earth every seventy-nine minutes from remotest space . There is as yet no hint of what the messages may mean , but that they are an attempt at communication is certain . The signals have been recorded on tape , and the sounds which follow are those which have been sent to Earth by alien , non-human , intelligent beings no one knows how far away .  A pause . Then the car radio , with night sounds and the calls of nightbirds for background , gave out crisp , distinct fluting noises , like someone playing an arbitrary selection of musical notes on a strange wind instrument .  The effect was plaintive , but Burke stiffened in every muscle at the first of them . The fluting noises were higher and lower in turn . At intervals , they paused as if between groups of signals constituting a word . The enigmatic sounds went on for a full minute . Then they stopped . The voice returned:  These are the signals from space . What you have heard is apparently a complete message . It is repeated five times and then ceases . An hour and nineteen minutes later it is again repeated five times . . . .  The voice continued , while Burke remained frozen and motionless in the parked car . Sandy watched him , at first hopefully , and then bewilderedly . The voice said that the signal strength was very great . But the power for artificial-satellite broadcasts is only a fraction of a watt . These signals , considering the minimum distance from which they could come , had at least thousands of kilowatts behind them .  Somewhere out in space , farther than mans robot rockets had ever gone , huge amounts of electric energy were controlled to send these signals to Earth . Scientists were in disagreement about the possible distance the signals had traveled , whether they were meant solely for Earth or not , and whether they were an attempt to open communication with humanity . But nobody doubted that the signals were artificial . They had been sent by technical means . They could not conceivably be natural phenomena . Directional fixes said absolutely that they did not come from Mars or Jupiter or Saturn . Neptune and Uranus and Pluto were not nearly in the line of the signals travel . Of course Venus and Mercury were to sunward of Earth , which ruled them out , since the signals arrived only on the night side of mankinds world . Nobody could guess , as yet , where they did originate .  Burke sat utterly still , every muscle tense . He was so pale that even in the moonlight Sandy saw it . She was alarmed .  Joe! Whats the matter ?  Did you--hear that ? he asked thinly . The signals ?  Of course . But what . . . .  I recognized them , said Burke , in a tone that was somehow despairing . Ive heard signals like that every so often since I was a kid . He swallowed . It was sounds like that , and what went with them , that has been the--trouble with me . I was going to tell you about it--and ask you if youd marry me anyway .  He began to tremble a little , which was not at all like the Joe Burke that Sandy knew .  I dont quite under--  Im afraid Ive gone out of my head , he said unsteadily . Look , Sandy! I was going to propose to you . Instead , Im going to take you back to the office . Im going to play you a recording I made a year ago . I think that when youve heard it youll decide you wouldnt want to marry me anyhow .  Sandy looked at him with astonished eyes .  You mean those signals from somewhere mean something special to you ?  Very special , said Burke . They raise the question of whether Ive been crazy , and am suddenly sane , or whether Ive been sane up to now , and have suddenly gone crazy .  The radio switched back to dance music . Burke cut it off . He started the cars motor . He backed , swung around , and headed for the office and construction shed of Burke Development , Inc .  Elsewhere , the profoundest minds of the planet gingerly examined the appalling fact that signals came to Earth from a place where men could not be . A message came from something which was not human . It was a suggestion to make cold chills run up and down any educated spine . But Burke drove tensely , and the roads surface sped toward the cars wheels and vanished under them . A warm breeze hummed and thuttered around the windshield . Sandy sat very still .  The way Im acting doesnt make sense , does it ? Burke asked . Do you feel like youre riding with a lunatic ?  No , she said . But I never thought that if you ever did get around to asking me to marry you , somebody from outer space would forbid the banns! Cant you tell me what all this is about ?  I doubt it very much , he told her . Can you tell me what the signals are about ?  She shook her head . He drove through the night . Presently he said , Aside from my private angle on the matter , there are some queer things about this business . Why should somebody out in space send us a broadcast ? Its not from a planet , they say . If theres a spaceship on the way here , why warn us ? If they want to be friends , they cant be sure well permit it . If they intend to be enemies , why throw away the advantage of surprise ? In either case , it would be foolish to send cryptic messages on ahead . And any message would have to be cryptic .  The car went whirring along the roadway . Soon twinkling lights appeared among the trees . The small and larger buildings of Burke Development , Inc . , came gradually into view . They were dark objects in a large empty space on the very edge of Burkes home town .  And why , he went on , why send a complex message if they only wanted to say that they were space travelers on the way to Earth ?  The exit from the highway to Burke Development appeared . Burke swung off the surfaced road and into the four-acre space his small and unusual business did not begin to fill up .  If it were an offer of communication , it should be short and simple . Maybe an arithmetic sequence of dots , to say that they were intelligent beings and would like the sequence carried on if we had brains , too . Then wed know somebody friendly was coming and wanted to exchange ideas before , if necessary , swapping bombs .  The cars headlights swept over the building in which the experimental work of Burke Development was done and on to the small house in which Sandy kept the books and records of the firm . Burke put on the brakes before the office door .  Just to see if my head is working right , he said , I raise a question about those signals . One doesnt send a long message to emptiness , repeated , in the hope that someone may be around to catch it . One calls , and sends a long message only when the call is answered . The call says whos wanted and whos calling , but nothing more . This isnt that sort of thing .  He got out of the car and opened the door on her side , then unlocked the office door and went in . He switched on the lights inside . For a moment , Sandy did not move . Then she slowly got out of the car and entered the office which was so completely familiar . Burke bent over the office safe , turning the tumbler-wheel to open it . He said over his shoulder , That special bulletin will be repeated on all the news broadcasts . Youve got a little radio here . Turn it on , will you ?  Again slowly , Sandy crossed the office and turned on the miniature radio on her desk . It warmed up and began to make noises . She dimmed it until it was barely audible . Burke stood up with a reel of brown tape . He put it on the office recorder , usually used for the dictation of the days lab log .  I have a dream sometimes , said Burke . A recurrent dream . Ive had it every so often since I was eleven . Ive tried to believe it was simply a freak , but sometimes Ive suspected I was a telepath , getting some garbled message from somewhere unguessable . That has to be wrong . And again Ive suspected that--well--that I might not be completely human . That I was planted here on Earth , somehow , not knowing it , to be of use to--something not of Earth . And thats crazy . So Ive been pretty leery of being romantic about anybody . Tonight Id managed to persuade myself all those wild imaginings were absurd . And then the signals came . He paused and said unsteadily , I made this tape a year ago . I was trying to convince myself that it was nonsense . Listen . Remember , I made this a year ago!  The reels began to spin on the recorders face . Burkes voice came out of the speaker , These are the sounds of the dream , it said , and stopped .  There was a moment of silence , while the twin reels spun silently . Then sounds came from the recorder . They were musical notes , reproduced from the tape . Sandy stared blankly . Disconnected , arbitrary flutelike sounds came out into the office of Burke Development , Inc . It was quite correct to call them elfin . They could be described as plaintive . They were not a melody , but a melody could have been made from them by rearrangement . They were very remarkably like the sounds from space . It was impossible to doubt that they were the same code , the same language , the same vocabulary of tones and durations .  Burke listened with a peculiarly tense expression on his face . When the recording ended , he looked at Sandy .  Sandy was disturbed . Theyre alike . But Joe , how did it happen ?  Ill tell you later , he said grimly . The important thing is , am I crazy or not ?  The desk radio muttered . It was an hourly news broadcast . Burke turned it up and a voice boomed:   . . . one oclock news . Messages have been received from space in the centurys most stupendous news event! Full details will follow a word from our sponsor .  There followed an ardent description of the social advantage , personal satisfaction and business advancement that must instantly follow the use of a particular intestinal regulator . The commercial ended .  From deepest space , boomed the announcers voice , comes a mystery! There is intelligent life in the void . It has communicated with us . Today--  Because of the necessity to give the later details of a cafe-society divorce case , a torch murder and a graft scandal in a large citys municipal budget , the signals from space could not be fully treated in the five-minute hourly news program . But fifteen seconds were spared for a sample of the cryptic sounds from emptiness . Burke listened to them with a grim expression .  I think , he said measuredly , that I am sane . I have heard those noises before tonight . I know them--Ill take you home , Sandy .  He ushered her out of the office and into his car .  Its funny , he said as he drove back toward the highway . This is probably the beginning of the most important event in human history . Weve received a message from an intelligent race that can apparently travel through space . Theres no way in the world to guess what it will bring about . It could be that were going to learn sciences to make old Earth a paradise . Or it could mean that well be wiped out and a superior race will take over . Funny , isnt it ?  Sandy said unsteadily , No . Not funny .  I mean , said Burke , when something really significant happens , which probably will determine Earths whole future , all I worry about is myself--that Im crazy , or a telepath , or something . But thats convincingly human!  What do you think I worry about ? asked Sandy .  Oh  . . . Burke hesitated , then said uncomfortably , I was going to propose to you , and I didnt .  Thats right , said Sandy . You didnt .  Burke drove for long minutes , frowning .  And I wont , he said flatly , after a time , until I know its all right to do so . Ive no explanation for whats kept me from proposing to you up to now , but apparently its not nonsense . I did anticipate the sounds that came in tonight from space and--Ive always known those sounds didnt belong on Earth .  Then , driving doggedly through a warm and moonlit night , he told her exactly why the fluting sounds were familiar to him; how theyd affected his life up to now . Hed mentally rehearsed the story , anyhow , and it was reasonably well arranged . But told as fact , it was preposterous .  She listened in complete silence . He finished the tale with his car parked before the boardinghouse in which Sandy lived with her sister Pam , they being all that was left of a family . If she hadnt known Burke all her life , of course , Sandy would have dismissed him and his story together . But she did know him . It did explain why he felt tongue-tied when he wished to be romantic , and even why he recorded a weird sequence of notes on a tape recorder . His actions were reasonable reactions to an unreasonable , repeated experience . His doubts and hesitations showed a sound mind trying to deal with the inexplicable . And now that the signals from space had come , it was understandable that he should react as if they were a personal matter for his attention .  She had a disheartening mental picture of a place where strange trees waved long and ribbonlike leaves under an improbable sky . Still  . . .  Y--yes , she said slowly when hed finished his uneasy account . I dont understand , but I can see how you feel . I--I guess Id feel the same way if I were a man and what youve experienced happened to me . She hesitated . Maybe there will be an explanation now , since those signals have come . They do match the ones you recorded from your dream . Theyre the ones you know about .  I cant believe it , said Burke miserably , and I cant dismiss it . I cant do anything until I find out why I know that somewhere theres a place with two moons and queer trees . . . .  He did not mention the part of his experience Sandy was most interested in--the person for whom he felt such anguished fear and such overwhelming joy when she was found . She didnt mention it either .  You go on home , Joe , she said quietly . Get a good nights sleep . Tomorrow well hear more about it and maybe it will all clear up . Anyhow--whatever turns out , I--Im glad you did intend to ask me to marry you . I intended to say yes .     Chapter 2   Burke was no less disturbed , but his disturbance was of a different kind . After he left Sandy at the house where she and her sister boarded , he headed back to the plant . He wanted to think things out .  The messages from space , of course , must presage events of overwhelming importance . The coming of intelligent aliens to Earth might be comparable to the coming of white men to the American continents . They might bring superior techniques , irresistible weapons , and an assumption of superiority that would bring inevitable conflict with the aborigines of Earth . Judging by the actions of the white race on Earth , if the newcomers were merely explorers it could mean the coming doom of humanitys independence . If they were invaders . . . .  Something like this would be pointed out soon after the news itself . Some people would react with total despair , expecting the strangers to act like men . Some might hope that a superior race would have developed a kindliness and altruism that on Earth are rather rare . But there was no one at all who would not be apprehensive . Some would panic .  Burkes reaction was strictly personal . Nobody else in the world would have felt the same appalled , stunned emotion he felt when he heard the sounds from space . Because to him they were familiar sounds .  He paced up and down in the big , partitionless building in which the actual work of Burke Development , Inc . , was done . Hed done some reasonably good work in this place . The prototype of the hydroponic wall for Interiors , Inc . , still stood against one wall . It was crude , but hed made it work and then built a production model which had now been shipped off complete . A little to one side was a prototype of a special machine which stamped out small parts for American Tool . That had been a tricky assignment! There were plastic and glass-wool and such oddments with which hed done a process-design job for Holmes Yachts , and a box of small parts left over from the designing job that gave one aviation company the only practical small-plane retractable landing-gear .  These things had a queer meaning for him now . Hed devised the wanted products . Hed developed certain needed processes . But now he began to be deeply suspicious of his own successes . Each was a new reason for uneasiness .  He grimly questioned whether his highly peculiar obsession had not been planted in him against the time when fluting noises would come from that illimitable void beyond Earths atmosphere .  He examined , for the thousandth time , his special linkage with the space noises . In previous soul-searchings hed pinpointed the time when the whole business began . Hed been eleven years old . He could even work out something close to an exact date . He was living with his aunt and uncle , his own parents being dead . His uncle had made a business trip to Europe , alone , and had brought back souvenirs which were fascinating to eleven-year-old Joe Burke . There was a flint knife , and a carved ivory object which his uncle assured him was mammoth ivory . It had a deers head incised into it . There were some fragments of pottery and a dull-surfaced black cube . They appealed to the small boy because his uncle said theyd belonged to men who lived when mammoths roamed the Earth and cave men hunted the now-extinct huge beasts . Cro-Magnons , his uncle said , had owned the objects . Hed bought them from a French peasant whod found a cave with pictures on its walls that dated back twenty thousand years . The French government had taken over the cave , but before reporting it the peasant had thriftily hidden away some small treasures to sell for himself . Burkes uncle bought them and , in time , presented them to the local museum . All but the black cube , which Burke had dropped . It had shattered into a million tissue-thin , shiny plates , which his aunt insisted on sweeping out . Hed tried to keep one of the plates , but his aunt had found it under his pillow and disposed of it .  He remembered the matter solely because hed examined his memories so often , trying to find something relevant to account for the beginning of his recurrent dream . Somewhere shortly after his uncles visit he had had a dream . Like all dreams , it was not complete . It made no sense . But it wasnt a normal dream for an eleven-year-old boy .  He was in a place where the sun had just set , but there were two moons in the sky . One was large and motionless . The other was small and moved swiftly across the heavens . From behind him came fluting signals like the messages that would later come from space . In the dream he was full-grown and he saw trees with extraordinary , ribbony leaves like no trees on Earth . They wavered and shivered in a gentle breeze , but he ignored them as he did the fluting sounds behind him .  He was searching desperately for someone . A child knows terror for himself , but not for anybody else . But Burke , then aged eleven , dreamed that he was in an agony of fear for someone else . To breathe was torment . He held a weapon ready in his hand . He was prepared to do battle with any imaginable creature for the person he needed to find . And suddenly he saw a figure running behind the waving foliage . The relief was almost greater pain than the terror had been . It was a kind and amount of emotion that an eleven-year-old boy simply could not know , but Burke experienced it . He gave a great shout , and bounded forward toward her--and the dream ended .  He dreamed it three nights running , then it stopped , for awhile .  Then , a week later , he had the dream again , repeated in every detail . He had it a dozen times before he was twelve , and as many more before he was thirteen . It recurred at random intervals all through his teens , while he was in college , and after . When he grew up he found out that recurrent dreams are by no means unusual . But this was very far from a usual dream .  From time to time , he observed new details in the dream . He knew that he was dreaming . His actions and his emotion did not vary , but he was able to survey them--like the way one can take note of items in a book one reads while quite absorbed in it . He came to notice the way the trees sent their roots out over the surface of the ground before dropping suckers down into it . He noticed a mass of masonry off to the left . He discovered that a hill in the distance was not a natural hill . He was able to remember markings on the large , stationary moon in the sky , and to realize that the smaller one was jagged and irregular in shape . The dream did not change , but his knowledge of the place of the dream increased .  As he grew older , he was startled to realize that though the trees , for example , were not real , they were consistent with reality . The weapon he held in his hand was especially disturbing . Its grip and barrel were transparent plastic , and in the barrel there was a sequence of peculiarly-shaped forms , in and about which wire had been wound . As a grown man hed made such shapes in metal , once . Hed tried them out as magnets in a job for American Tool . But they werent magnets . They were something specific and alarming instead . He also came to know exactly what the mass of masonry was , and it was a sober engineering feat . No boy of eleven could have imagined it .  And always there were the flutelike musical sounds coming from behind him . When he was twenty-five hed memorized them . Hed heard them--dreamed them--hundreds of times . He tried to duplicate them on a flute and devised a special mute to get exactly the tone quality he remembered so well . He made a recording to study , but the study was futile .  In a way , it was unwholesome to be so much obsessed by a dream . In a way , the dream was magnificently irrelevant to messages transmitted through millions of miles of emptiness . But the flutelike sounds linked it--now--to reality! He paced up and down in the empty , resonant building and muttered , I ought to talk to the space-exploration people .  Then he laughed . That was ironical . All the crackpots in the world would be besieging all the authorities who might be concerned with the sounds from space , impassionedly informing them what Julius Caesar , or Chief Sitting Bull , or some other departed shade , had told them about the matter via automatic writing or Ouija boards . Those who did not claim ghostly authority would explain that they had special talents , or a marvelous invention , or that they were members of the race which had sent the messages the satellite-tracking stations received .  No . It would serve no purpose to inform the Academy of Sciences that hed been dreaming signals like the ones that now agitated humanity . It was too absurd . But it was unthinkable for a person of Burkes temperament to do nothing . So he set to work in exactly the fashion of one of the crackpots he disliked .  Actually , the job should have been undertaken in ponderous secrecy by committees from various learned societies , official bureaus , and all the armed forces . There should have been squabbles about how the task was to be divided up , bitter arguments about how much money was to be spent by whom , violent disagreements about research-and-development contracts . It should have been treated as a program of research , in which everybody could claim credit for all achievements and nobody was to blame for blunders .  Burke could not command resources for so ambitious an undertaking . And he knew that as a private project it was preposterous . But he began the sort of preliminary labor that an engineer does before he really sets to work .  He jotted down some items that he didnt have to worry about . The wall-garden hed made for Interiors , Inc . , would fit neatly into whatever final result he got--if he got a final result . He had a manufacturing process available for glass-wool and plastics . If he could get hold of an inertia-controlled computer hed be all set , but he doubted that he could . The crucial item was a memo hed made from a memory of the dream weapon . It concerned certain oddly-shaped bits of metal , with fine wires wound eccentrically about them , which flew explosively to pieces when a current went through them . That was something to worry about right away .  At three oclock in the morning , then , Burke routed out the laboratory notes on the small-sized metal-stamping machine he had designed for American Tool . Hed tried to do the job with magnets , but they flew apart . Hed wound up with blank cartridges to provide the sudden , explosive stamping action required , but the notes on the quasi-magnets were complete .  He went through them carefully . An electromagnet does not really attain its full power immediately after the current is turned on . There is an inductive resistance , inherent in a wound magnet , which means that the magnetism builds up gradually . From his memory of the elements in a transparent-plastic hand-weapon barrel , Burke had concluded that it was possible to make a magnet without inductive resistance . He tried it . When the current went on it went to full strength immediately . In fact , it seemed to have a negative-induction effect . But the trouble was that it wasnt a magnet . It was something else . It wound up as scrap .  Now , very reflectively , he plugged in a metal lathe and carefully turned out a very tiny specimen of the peculiarly-shaped magnetic core . He wound it by hand , very painstakingly . It was a tricky job . It was six oclock Saturday morning when the specimen was finished . He connected the leads to a storage battery and threw the switch . The small object tore itself to bits , and the core landed fifteen feet from where it had been . Burke beamed .  He wasnt tired , but he wanted to think things over so he drove to a nearby diner and got coffee and a roll and reflected with satisfaction upon his accomplishment . At the cost of several hours work hed made a thing like a magnet , which wasnt a magnet , and which destroyed itself when turned on . As he drank his coffee , a radio news period came on . He listened .  The signals still arrived from space , punctually , seventy-nine minutes apart . At this moment , 6:30 A .M . , they were not heard on the Atlantic coast , but the Pacific coast still picked them up and they were heard in Hawaii and again on the South Pacific island of Kalua .  Burke drove back to the plant . He was methodical , now . He reactivated the prototype wall-garden which hed neglected while building the larger one for Interiors , Inc . The experimental one had been made in four sections so he could try different pumping systems and nutrient solutions . Now he set the pumps to work . The plants looked ragged , but theyd perk up with proper lighting and circulation of the hydroponic liquid .  Then he went into the plants small office building and sat down with drawing instruments to modify the design of the magnetic core . At eleven hed worked out a rough theory and refined the design , with curves and angles all complete . At four the next morning a second , modified magnet-core was formed and polished .  Hed heard the first newscast on Friday night . It was now early Sunday morning , and although he was tired , he was still not sleepy . He worked on doggedly , winding fine magnet wire on a noticeably complicated metal form . Just before sunrise he tested it .  When the current went on the wire windings seemed to swell . Hed held it in a small clamp while he tested it . The clamp overturned and broke the contact with the battery before the winding wire stretched to breaking-point . But it had not torn itself or anything else to bits .  He was suddenly enormously weary and bleary-eyed . To anyone else in the world , the consequence of this second attempt to make what he thought of as a negative-induction magnet would seem an absolute failure . But Burke now knew why the first had failed and what was wrong with the second . The third would work , just as the unfired hand-weapon of his dream would have worked . Now he could justify to himself the association of a recurrent dream with a message from outer space . The dream now had two points of contact with reality . One was the sounds from emptiness , which matched those in the dream . The other was the hand-weapon of the dream , whose essential working part now plainly did something unknown in a normal world .  But it would be impossible to pass on his information to anybody else . Too many crackpots have claimed too many triumphs . His actual , unpredictable technical achievement would have little chance of winning official acceptance . Especially since he would be considered a non-accredited source . Burke had a small business of his own . He had an engineering degree . But he had no background of learned futility to gain a hearing for what he now knew .  Crackpots of the world , unite! he muttered to himself .  He dragged himself out-of-doors to a cool , invigorating morning and drove somnolently to the diner hed patronized before . The coffee he ordered was atrocious , but it waked him . He heard two truck drivers at the counter .  Its baloney! said one of them scornfully . There aint no people out there! Weda heard from them before if there was . Them scientists are crazy!  Nuts! said the other earnestly . One of their idle thoughts would crack your brain wide open , mac! They know whats up , and theyre scared! If you wanna know , Im scared too!  Of what ?  Hell! Did you ever drive at night , and have all the stars come in pairs like snake-eyes--like little mean eyes , lookin down at you an despisin you ? Youve seen that , aint you ? Whoevers signalin could be lookin down at us just like the stars do .  The first man grunted .  I dont like it! said the second man , fretfully . If it was a man headin out to go huntin among the stars for somethin he wanted , thats all right . Thats like a man goin huntin in the woods with a gun . But I dont like somebody comin our way from somewhere else . Maybe hes huntin us!  The two drivers paid for their coffee and went out . And Burke reflected wryly that the second man had , after all , expressed a universal truth . We humans do not like to be hunted . The passion with which a man-killing wild beast is pursued comes from human vanity . We do not like the idea that any other creature can be better than we are . It is highly probable that if we ever have to face a superior race , we will die of it .  So Burke went back to the plant and began to make yet another of the peculiarly wound magnets-which-were-not-magnets . This was to have three of the odd-shaped cores , formed in line , of a single piece of Swedish iron . As the windings were put on theyd be imbedded in plastic . Over that would go a casing to keep them from expanding or stretching . It ought to be distinctively different from a magnet .  It was an extremely long and utterly tedious job . He knew what he was doing , but he had doubts about the why . As he worked , though , he wrestled out a detailed theory . Discoverers often work like that . It was said that Columbus didnt know where he was going when he started out , didnt know where he was when he got there , and didnt know where hed been when he got back . The history of the discovery of the triode tube has points of similarity . Burke had begun with a device which destroyed itself when turned on , developed the idea into a device which swelled to uselessness when energized , and now hoped that it would turn out at the third try to be something the textbooks said was impossible .  Outside the construction shed , the world went about its business . While Burke worked on through the Sunday noon hour , a Japanese radar telescope aimed at the night sky and made six successive position-findings on the source of the space signals . When sunset found him laboring doggedly at a metal lathe , Croydon made eight . American radar telescopes had made others . Carefully computed , the observations added up to the discovery of an independent motion of the signal source . It moved against the stars as if it were a solar-system body with an orbit in the asteroid belt some three hundred sixty million miles from the sun--as compared to Earths ninety-two million .  At midnight on Sunday , while Burke painstakingly made micrometric examination of the triple magnet-core , Harvard Observatory reported that there should be a very minor asteroid at the spot in space from which the signals came .  The coincidental asteroid was known as Schulls object . It was listed as M-387 in the catalogs . It had been discovered in 1913 , was a very minor celestial body , had an estimated greatest diameter of less than two miles , and its brightness had been noticed to vary , suggesting that it was of irregular shape . It was too insignificant to have been kept under constant observation , but the signals from space appeared definitely to originate from its position .  An hour after midnight , Eastern Standard time , Palomar detected the infinitesimal speck of light which was Schulls object at exactly the place the radar telescopes insisted was the signal source . Satellite-watching stations now monitored the cryptic signals around the clock , and radar telescopes began to sweep space for possible answers to the space broadcast . There was an uncomfortable possibility that the transmitter might not be signaling Earth , after all , but a fellow mystery of space--an associate or a sister-ship .  More data turned up . M .I .T . made examination of the signals themselves . Timed , the intervals between notes varied as if keyed by something alive . But successive broadcasts were identical to microseconds . The conclusion was that the original broadcast had been set up by hand , as it were , but that all were now transmitted mechanically--automatically--by a robot transmitter .  It was Monday morning when Burke completed the last turn of the last winding of his three-element pseudo-magnet . There are many things which become something else when they change in degree . Electromagnetic radiation may be long radio waves or radiant heat or yellow light or ultraviolet or X-rays , or who knows what , according to its frequency . It is different things with different properties at different wavelengths . Burke believed that his cores and windings were something other than magnets because the flux they produced was of a different intensity . He did not believe it to be magnetism .  At nine oclock Monday morning , he was clumsy from pure , weariness when he began to fit the outer case on the thing hed worked so long to complete . The hand-weapon in his dream undoubtedly flung bullets through a rifled bore penetrating the very center of the multiple core . The design of the hand-weapon ruled out any possibility of a considerable recoil . It wasnt built to allow the hand to take a recoil . So there must be no recoil . On that basis , Burke had made what finally amounted to a thick rod some six inches long and two in diameter . With the casing in place , it was absolutely solid . There was no play for the windings to expand into . He blinked at it . Common sense said he ought to put it aside and test it when his mind was not nearly numb from fatigue .  Then Sandy came into the constructions shed , looking for him . Shed arrived for work and seen his car outside the shed . Her expression indicated several things: a certain uneasiness , and some embarrassment , and more than a little indignation . When she saw him unshaven and wobbly with weariness , she protested .  Joe! Youve been working since Heaven knows when!  Since I left you , he admitted . I got interested .  You look dreadful!  Maybe Ill look worse after I try out this thing Ive made . Im not sure .  When did you eat last ? she demanded . And when did you sleep ?  He shrugged tiredly , regarding the thing in his hands . Hed had enough experience contriving new things to know that no theory is right until something that depends on it has been made and works . He tended to be pessimistic . But this time he thought he had it .  Is this working night and day a part of your reaction to those signals ? asked Sandy unhappily . If it is--  Lets try it , Burke interrupted . Its something I worked out from the dream . Now Ill find out whether Im crazy or not--maybe . He drew a deep breath . He had a sudden , deep and corrosive doubt of things which didnt make sense , like space signals and magnets which werent magnets because they were capable of negative self-induction . If this shows no sign of working , Sandy . . . .  What ?  He didnt answer . He went heavily over to the table where he had storage-battery current available . He plucked a momentary-contact switch out of a drawer and connected it to the wires from the small thing hed made . Then he hooked on the storage battery .  Stand back , Sandy , he said tiredly . Well see what happens .  He flipped the momentary-contact switch . There was a crash and a roar . The six-inch thing leaped . It grazed Burkes head and drew blood . It flashed across the room , a full thirty feet , and then smashed a water-cooler and imbedded itself in the brick wall beyond . A tool cabinet tottered and crashed to the floor . The storage battery spouted steam , swelled . Burke grabbed Sandy and plunged outside with her as the building filled with vaporized battery acid .  Outside , he put her down and rubbed his nose with his finger .  That was a surprise , he said with some animation . Are you all right ?  You--could have been killed! she said in a whisper .  I wasnt , said Burke . If youre not hurt theres no harm done . It looks like the thing worked! Lucky that was only a millisecond contact! Negative self-induction . . . . Ill break some windows and come to the office .  He did break windows , from the outside , so air could flow through the building and clear away the battery-acid steam . Sandy watched him anxiously .  Okay , he said . Ill come quietly .  He followed her to the office . He was so physically worn out , he tripped on the office step as he went in .  Tell me the news on the signals , he said . Still coming in ?  Yes . She looked at him again , worried . Joe  . . . Sit down . Here . Whats happened ?  Nothing except that Im a genius at second hand . I didnt intend it that way , and maybe it can be covered up , but Ive turned out to be sane . So I think , maybe youd better get another job . Since Im sane Ill surely go bankrupt and maybe Ill end up in jail . But its going to be interesting . His head drooped and he jerked it upright . This is reaction , he said distinctly . Im tired . I wanted badly to find out whether I was crazy or not . I found out I havent been . Im not so sure I wont be presently . He made a stiff gesture and said , Take the day off , Sandy . Im going to rest awhile .  Then his head fell forward and he was asleep .  Burke slept for a long time . And this time dreamlessly .  The thing he made had worked for much less than the tenth of a second , but it came out of his dream , ultimately , and it was linked with whatever sent messages from Asteroid M-387 . There was still nothing intelligible about the whole affair . It contained no single rational element . But if there was no rational explanation , there was what now seemed reasonable action that could be taken .  So he slept , and as usual the world went on its way unheeding . The fluting sounds from the sky remained the top news story of the day . There was no doubt of their artificiality , nor that they came from a small , tumbling , jagged rock which was one of the least of the more than fifteen hundred asteroids of the solar system . It was two hundred and seventy million miles from Earth . The latest computations said that not less than twenty thousand kilowatts of power had been put into the transmitter to produce so strong and loud a signal on Earth . No power-source of that order had been carried out to make the signals . But they were there .  Astronomers became suddenly important sources of news . They contradicted each other violently . Eminent scientists observed truthfully that Schulls object , as such , could not sustain life . It could not have an atmosphere , and its gravitational field would not hold even a moderately active microbe on its surface . Therefore any life and any technology now on it must have come from somewhere else . The most eminent scientists said reluctantly that they could not deny the possibility that a spaceship from some other solar system had been wrecked on M-387 , and was now sending hopeless pleas for help to the local planetary bodies .  Others observed briskly that anything which smashed into an asteroid would vaporize , if it hit hard enough , or bounce away if it did not . So there was no evidence for a spaceship . There was only evidence for a transmitter . There was no explanation for that . It could be mentioned , said these skeptics , that there were other sources of radiation in space . There was the Jansky radiation from the Milky Way , and radiations from clouds of ionized material in emptiness , and radio stars were well known . A radio asteroid was something new , but--  It was working astronomers , so to speak , who took action . They had been bouncing signals off of Earths moon , and various artificial satellites , and theyd flicked signals in the direction of Mars and Venus and believed that they got them back . The most probable returned radar signal from Mars had been received by a radar telescope in West Virginia . It had been turned temporarily into a transmitter and some four hundred kilowatts were poured into it to go out in a tight beam . The working astronomers took over that parabolic bowl again . They borrowed , begged , wheedled , and were suspected of stealing necessary equipment to put nearly eight hundred kilowatts into a microwave signal , this time beamed at Asteroid M-387 . If intelligent beings received the signal , they might reply . If they did , the working astronomers would figure out what to do next .  Burke slept in the office of Burke Development , Inc . His features were relaxed and peaceful . Sandy was completely helpless before his tranquil exhaustion . But presently she used the telephone and spoke in a whisper to her younger sister , Pam . In time , Pam came in a cab bringing blankets and a pillow . She and Sandy got Burke to a pallet on the floor with a pillow under his head and a thickness of blanket over him . He slept on , unshaven and oblivious .  Pam said candidly , If you can feel romantic about anything like that , Sandy , Ill still love you , but Ill join the men in thinking that women are mysterious!  She departed in the cab and Sandy took up a vigil over Burkes slumbering form .  Pravda announced in its evening edition of Monday that Soviet scientists would send out a giant space-probe , intended to orbit around Venus , to investigate the space-signal source . The probe would carry a man . It would blast off within six weeks , preceded by drone fuel-carriers which would be overtaken by the probe and furnish fuel to it . Pravda threw in a claim that Russians had been first to refuel an aeroplane in flight , and asserted that Soviet physical science would make a space-voyage of two hundred seventy million miles mere ducksoup for their astronaut .  Editorially , American newspapers mentioned that the Russians had tried similar things before , and that at least three coffins now floated in orbit around Earth , not to mention the one on the moon . But if they tried it . . . . The American newspapers waited for a reaction from Washington .  It came . The most eminent of civilian scientists announced proudly that the United States would proceed to the design and testing of multi-stage rockets capable of landing a party on Mars when Earth and Mars were in proper relative position . This having been accomplished , a rocket would then take off from Mars for Asteroid M-387 to investigate the radio transmissions from that peculiar mass of tumbling rock . It was blandly estimated that the Americans might take off for Mars in eighteen months .  Sandy watched over Burke . There was nothing to do in the office . She did not read . Near seven the telephone rang , and she frantically muffled its sound . It was Pam , asking what Sandy meant to do about dinner . Sandy explained in an almost inaudible voice . Pam said resignedly , All right . Ill come out and bring something . Lucky its a warm day . We can sit in your car and eat . If I had to watch Joe sleeping like that and needing a shave as he does , Id lose my appetite .  She hung up . When she arrived , Burke was still asleep . Sandy went outside . Pam had brought hero sandwiches and coffee . They sat on the steps of the office and ate .  I know , said Pam between sympathy and scorn , I know you like the poor goof , Sandy , but there ought to be some limit to your amorous servitude! There are office hours! Youre supposed to knock off at five . Its seven-thirty now . And what will being decent to that unshaven Adonis get you ? Hell take you for granted , and go off and marry a nitwit of a blonde wholl hate you because youd have been so much better for him . And shell get you fired and what then ?  Joe wont marry anybody else , said Sandy forlornly . If he could fall for anybody , itd be me . He told me so . He started to propose to me Friday night .  So ? said Pam , with the superior air of a younger sister . Did he say enough for you to sue him ?  He cant fall in love with anybody , said Sandy . He wants to marry me , but hes emotionally tangled up with a female hes had dreams about since he was eleven .  I thought Id heard everything , said Pam . But that--  Sandy explained morosely . As she told it , it was not quite the same picture Burke had given her . Her account of the trees in Burkes recurrent dream was accurate enough , and the two moons in the sky , and the fluting , arbitrary tones from behind him . Pam had heard their duplicates , along with all the broadcast listeners in the United States . But as Sandy told it , the running figure beyond the screen of foliage was not at all the shadowy movement Burke described . Sandy had her own ideas , and they colored her account .  There was a stirring inside the small office building . Burke had waked . He turned over and blinked , astonished to find himself with blankets over him and a pillow under his head . It was dark inside the office , too .  Joe , called Pam in the darkness , Sandy and I have been waiting for you to wake up . You took your time about it! Weve got some coffee for you .  Burke got to his feet and stumbled to the light switch .  Fine! he said ruefully . Somebody got blankets for me , too! Nice business , this!  They heard him moving about . He folded the blankets that had been laid on the floor for him . He moved across the room and turned on Sandys desk radio . It hummed , preliminary to playing . He came to the door .  Im sorry , he apologized . I worked pretty hard pretty long , and when the thing was finished I passed out . I feel better now . Did you actually say you had some coffee ?  Sandy passed up a cardboard container .  Pams compliments , she said . Weve been waiting until you slept off your working binge . We didnt want to leave you . Booger-men sound likelier than they used to .  A voice from the radio broke in .    . . . oclock news . A signal has been beamed toward the space-broadcast transmitter by the parabolic reflector of the Bradenville radar telescope , acting as a mirror to concentrate the message toward Asteroid M-387 . So far there has been no reply . We are keeping a circuit open , and if or when an answer is received we will issue a special bulletin . . . . The San Francisco Giants announced today that in a three-way trade--  Burke had listened to nothing else while the news broadcast dealt with space signals , but other news did not mean very much to him just now . He sipped at the cardboard cup of coffee .  I think , said Pam , that since youve waked up Ill take my big sister home . Youll be all right now .  Yes , said Burke abstractedly . Ill be all right now .  Really , Joe , you shouldnt work day and night without a break! Sandy said .  And you shouldnt have bothered to stand watch over me , he answered . Well , I guess the shed should be clear of battery fumes by now . Ill go over and see .  Burke came back in a few minutes .  This thing I made is pretty tough , he observed . It smashed into a brick wall , but it was the wall that suffered . He fingered it thoughtfully . I had that dream again just now , he volunteered . While I was asleep on the floor . Sandy , you know about such things better than I do . How much money have I in the bank ? Im going to build something and itll probably cost a lot .  Sandys hands had clenched when he mentioned the dream . So far , it had done more damage than any dream had a right to do . But it looked as if it were about to do more . She told him his balance in the bank . He nodded .  Maybe I can stretch it , he observed . Im going to--  The music had stopped inside the office . The voice of an announcer interrupted .  Special Bulletin! Special Bulletin! Our signals to space have been answered! Special Bulletin! Here is a direct report from the Bradenton radar telescope which , within the hour , broadcast a message to space!  A tinny , agitated voice came from the radio , punctuated by those tiny beeping sounds that say that a telephone talk is being recorded .  A definite reply to the human signal to Asteroid M-387 has been received . It is cryptic , like the first message from space , but is unmistakably a response to the eight-hundred-kilowatt message beamed toward the source of those world-wide-received strange sounds . . . .  The tinny voice went on .     Chapter 3   In retrospect , events moved much faster than reason would suggest . The first signal from space had been received on a Friday . At that time--when the first flutings were picked up by a tape recorder on Kalua--the world had settled down to await the logical consequences of its history . It was not a comfortable settling-down , because the consequences were not likely to be pleasant . Earth was beginning to be crowded , and there were whole nations whose populations labored bitterly with no hope of more than subsistence during their lifetime , and left a legacy of equal labor and scarcer food for their descendants . There were hydrogen bombs and good intentions , and politics and a yearning for peace , and practically all individual men felt helpless before a seemingly merciless march of ominous events . At that time , too , nearly everybody worked for somebody else , and a large part of the employed population justified its existence by the length of time spent at its place of employment . Nobody worried about what he did there .  In the richer nations , everybody wanted all the rewards earned for them by generations gone by , but nobody was concerned about leaving his children better off . An increasingly smaller number of people were willing to take responsibility for keeping things going . Thered been a time when half of Earth fought valiantly to make the world safe for democracy . Now , in the richer nations , most men seemed to believe that the world had been made safe for a four-card flush , which was the hand theyd been dealt and which nobody tried to better .  Then the signals came from space . They called for a showdown , and very few people were prepared for it . Eminent men were called on to take command and arrange suitable measures . They immediately acted as eminent men so often do; they took action to retain their eminence . Their first instinct was caution . When a man is important enough , it does not matter if he never does anything . It is only required of him that he do nothing wrong . Eminent figures all over the world prepared to do nothing wrong . They were not so concerned to do anything right .  Burke , however , was not important enough to mind making a mistake or two . And there were other non-famous people to whom the extra-terrestrial sounds suggested action instead of precautions . Mostly they were engineers with no reputations to lose . Theyd scrabbled together makeshift equipment , ignored official channels , and in four days--Friday to Monday--they had eight hundred kilowatts ready to fling out toward emptiness , in response to the signal from M-387 .  The transmission theyd sent out was five minutes long . It began with a re-transmission of part of the message Earth had received . This plainly identified the signal from Earth as a response to the cryptic flutings . Then there were hummings . One dot , two dots , three , and so on . These hummings assured whoever or whatever was out yonder that the inhabitants of Earth could count . Then it was demonstrated that two dots plus two dots were known to equal four dots , and that four and four added up to eight . The inhabitants of Earth could add . There followed the doubtless interesting news that two and two and two and two was eight . Humanity could multiply .  Arithmetic , in fact , filled up three minutes of the eight-hundred-kilowatt beam-signal . Then a hearty human voice--the president of a great university--said warmly:  Greetings froth Earth! We hope for splendid things from this opening of communication with another race whose technical achievements fill us with admiration .  More flutings repeated that the Earth signal was intended for whoever or whatever used flutelike sounds for signaling purposes , and the message came to an end with an arch comment from the university president: We hope youll answer!  When this elaborate hodge-podge had been flung out to immensity , the prominent persons whod devised it shook hands with each other . They were confident that if intelligent beings did exist where the mournful musical notes came from , interplanetary or interstellar communication could be said to have begun . The engineers whod sweated together the equipment simply hoped their signal would reach its target .  It did . It went out just after the end of a reception of a five-minute broadcast from M-387 . Seventy-nine minutes should have passed before any other sound from M-387 . But an answer came much more quickly than that . In thirty-four minutes , five and three-tenth seconds , a new signal came from beyond the sky . It came in a rush . It came from the transmitter out in orbit far beyond Mars . It came with the same volume .  It started with an entirely new grouping of the piping tones . There was a specific crispness in their transmission , as if a different individual handled the transmitter-keys . The flutings went on for three minutes , then were replaced by entirely new sounds . These were sharp , distinct , crackling noises . A last sequence of the opening flutings , and the message ended abruptly . But silence did not follow . Instead , a steady , sonorous , rhythmic series of beeping noises began and kept on interminably . They were remarkably like the directional signals of an airway beacon . When the news broadcasts of the United States reported the matter , the beeping sounds were still coming in .  And they continued to come in for seventy-nine minutes . Then they broke off and the new transmission was repeated . The original message was no longer sent . Robot transmitter or no robot transmitter , the first message had been transmitted at regular intervals for something like seventy-six hours and then , instantly on receipt of the beginning of an answer , a new broadcast took its place .  The reaction had been immediate . The distance between M-387 and Earth could be computed exactly . The time needed for the Earth signal to arrive was known exactly . And the instant--the very instant--the first sound from Earth reached M-387 , the second message had begun . There was no pause to receive all the Earth greeting , or even part of it . The reaction was immediate and automatic .  Automatic . That was the significant thing . The new message was already prepared when the Earth signal arrived . It was set up to be transmitted on receipt of the earliest possible proof that it would be received . The effect of this rapid response was one of tremendous urgency--or absolute arrogance . The implication was that what Earth had to say was unimportant . The Earth signal had not been listened to . Instead , Earth was told something . Something crisp and arbitrary . Maybe there could be amiable chit-chat later on , but Earth must listen first! The beepings could not be anything but a guide , a directional indicator , to be followed to M-387 . The message , now changed , might amount to an offer of friendship , but it also could be a command . If it were a command , the implications were horrifying .  At the moment of first release , the news had only a limited effect . Most of Europe was asleep and much of Asia had not waked up yet . But the United States was up and stirring . The news went to every corner of the nation with the speed of light . Radio stations stopped all other transmissions to announce the frightening event . It is of record that four television stations on the North American continent actually broke into filmed commercials to announce that M-387 had made a response to the signal from Earth . Never before in history had a paid advertisement been thrust aside for news .  In the United States , then , there was agitation , apprehension , indignation , and panic . Perhaps the only place where anything like calmness remained was inside and outside the office of Burke Development , Inc . , where Burke felt a singular relief at this evidence that he wasnt as much of a fool as he feared .  Well , he thought . It looks like there is something or somebody out there . If Id been sure about it earlier--but it probably wasnt time .  What does this mean ? asked Sandy . This horrible spell of around-the-clock working! Are you still trying to do something about the space signals ?  Listen , Sandy , said Burke . Ive been ashamed of that crazy dream of mine all my life . Ive thought it was proof there was something wrong with me . Ill still have to keep it secret , or nice men in white coats will come and get me . But Im going to do what all enterprising young men are advised to do--dream greatly and then try to realize my dream . Its quite impossible and itll bankrupt me , but I think Im going to have fun .  He grinned at the two sisters as he led them firmly to Sandys car .  Shoo! he said pleasantly . Youd better go home now . Ill be leaving in minutes , heading for Schenectady first . I need some electric stuff . Then Ill go elsewhere . Therell be some shipments arriving , Sandy . Take care of them for me , will you ?  He closed the car door and waved , still grinning . Pam fumed and started the motor . Moments later their car trundled down the highway toward town . Sandy clenched her fists .  What can you do with a man like that ? she demanded . Why do I bother with him ?  Shall I answer , asked Pam , or shall I be discreetly sympathetic ? I wouldnt want him! But unfortunately , if you do--  I know , said Sandy forlornly . I know , dammit!  Burke was not thinking of either of them then . He opened the office safe , put the six-inch object inside , and took out his checkbook . Then he locked up , got into his car , and headed away from the plant and the town hed been brought up in . He was unshaven and uncombed and this was an inappropriate time to start out on a drive of some hundreds of miles , but it was a pleasing sensation to know that a job had turned up that nobody else would even know how to start to work on . He drove very cheerfully to a cross-country expressway and turned onto it . He settled down at once to drive and to think .  He drove practically all night . Shortly after sunrise he stopped to buy a razor and brush and comb and to make himself presentable . He was the first customer on hand when a Schenectady firm specializing in electronic apparatus for seagoing ships opened up for business . He ordered certain equipment from a list hed written on an envelope while eating breakfast .  The morning papers , naturally , were full of the story of the answer to the Earth signal sent out to M-387 . The morning comedians made jokes about it , and in every one of the business offices Burke visited there was some mention of it . He listened , but had nothing to say . The oddity of his purchases caused no remark . His was a small firm , but a man working in research and development needs strange stuff sometimes . He ordered two radar units to be modified in a particular fashion , air-circulation pumps of highly specialized design to be changed in this respect and that . He had trouble finding the electric generators he wanted and had to pay heavily for alterations in them , and even more heavily for a promise of delivery in days instead of weeks . He bought a self-contained diving suit .  He was busy for three days , buying things by day , designing by night and finding out new things to order . On the second day , United States counter-intelligence reported that the Russians were trying to signal M-387 on their own . An American satellite picked up the broadcast . The Russians denied it , and continued to try . Burke made arrangements for the delivery of aluminum-alloy bars , rods , girders , and plates; for plaster of Paris in ton lots; for closed-circuit television equipment . Once he called Sandy to give her an order to be filled locally . It was lumber , mostly slender strips of lathing , to be on hand when he returned .  All kinds of material is turning up , said Sandy . Thereve been six deliveries this morning . Im signing receipts for it because I dont know what else to do . But wont you please give me copies of the orders youve placed so I can check what arrives ?  Ill put em in the mail--airmail , promised Burke . But only six deliveries ? There ought to be dozens! Get after these people on long distance , will you ? And he gave her a list of names .  Burke said suddenly , I had that dream again last night . Twice in a week . Thats unusual .  No comment , Sandy said .  She hung up , and Burke was taken aback . But there was hardly any comment she could make . Burke himself had no illusion that he would ever come to a place where there were two moons in the sky and trees with ribbonlike leaves . And if he did--unthinkable as that might be--he could not imagine finding the person for whom he felt such agonized anxiety . The dream , recurrent , fantastic , or whatnot , simply could not represent a reality of the past , present , or future . Such things dont happen . But Burke continued to be moved much more by the emotional urge of the repeated experience than by intellectual curiosity about his having dreamed repeatedly of signals exactly like those from space , long before such signals ever were .  He made ready to try to do something about those signals . And , all reason to the contrary notwithstanding , to him they meant a world with two moons and strange vegetation and such emotion as nothing on Earth had ever quite stirred up--though he felt pretty deeply about Sandy , at that . So he went intently from one supplier of exotic equipment to another , spending what money he had for an impossibility . Impossible because Asteroid M-387 was not over two miles through at its largest dimension , and therefore could not possibly have an atmosphere and certainly not trees , and it could not own even a single moon!  He spent one day at a small yachting port with a man for whom hed worked out a special process of Fiberglas yacht construction . Through that process , Holmes yachts could be owned by people who werent millionaires . Holmes was a large , languid , sunburned individual who built yachts because he liked them . He had much respect for Burke , even after Burke asked his help and explained what for .  But that was the day the Russians launched an unmanned space-probe headed toward M-387 . That development may have influenced Holmes to do as Burke asked .  Later on , it transpired that the probe originally had been designed and built as a cargo-carrier to take heavy loads to Earths moon . The Russian space service had planned to present the rest of Earth with a fait accompli even more startling than the first Sputnik . They had intended to send a fleet of drone cargo-rockets to the moon and then assemble them into a colony . Broadcasts would triumphantly explain that the Soviet social system was responsible for another technical achievement . But to get a man out to M-387 was now so much more important a propaganda device that the cargo-carriers were converted into fuel-tankers and the first sent aloft .  At ten thousand miles up , when the third booster-stage should have given it a decisive thrust , one of the probes rocket engines misfired . The space-probe tilted , veered wildly from its course , and went on accelerating splendidly toward nowhere . And still the steady , urgent beeping sounds continued to come to Earth , with every seventy-nine minutes a broadcast containing one section of crackling sounds and a tone of extremest urgency .  The day after the probes ineffectual departure , Burke got back to his plant . He brought Holmes with him . Together , they looked over the accumulated material for Burkes enterprise and began to sort out the truckloads of plaster of Paris , masses of punched-sheet aluminum , girders , rods , beams of shining metal , cased dynamos , crated pumps , tanks , and elaborately padded objects whose purpose was not immediately clear . Sandy was overwhelmed by the job of inventorying , indexing , and otherwise making the material available for use as desired . There were bales of fluffy white cloth and drums and drums of liquids which insisted on leaking , and smelled very badly when they did . But Burke found some items not yet on hand , and fretted , so Sandy brought her sister Pam into the office to add to the office force .  Sandy and Pam worked quite as hard in the office as Burke and Holmes in the construction shed . They telephoned protests at delays , verified shipments , scolded shipping-clerks , argued with transportation-system expediters , wrote letters , answered letters , compared invoices with orders , sternly battled with negligence and delays of all kinds , and in between kept the books of Burke Development , Inc . , up to date so that at any instant Burke could find out how much money hed spent and how little remained . The two girls in the office were necessary to the operations which at first centered in the construction shed , but shortly began to show up outside .  Four workmen arrived from the Holmes Yacht shipyard . They looked at blueprints and drawings made by Holmes and Burke together , regarded with pained expressions the material they were to use , and set to work . This was on the day the second Russian space-probe lifted from somewhere in the Caucasus Mountains at 1:10 A .M . , local time .  The second probe did not veer off its proper line . Its four boosters fired at appropriate intervals and it went streaking off toward emptiness almost straight away from the sun . It left behind it a thin whining transmission which was not at all like the beepings of the asteroid transmitter .  In two days a framework of struts and laths took form outside the construction shed . It looked more like a mock-up of a radio telescope than anything else , but it was smaller and had a different shape . It was an improbable-looking bowl . Under Holmes supervision , dozens of sacks of plaster of Paris found their way into it , coating it roughly on the outside and very smoothly within . It was then lined tenderly with carefully cut sections of fluffy cloth , with bars and beams and girders placed between the layers . Then reeking drums of liquid were moved to the working-site and their contents saturated the glass-wool .  The smell was awful , so the workmen knocked off for a day until it diminished . But Sandy and Pam continued to expostulate with shippers by long-distance , type letters threatening lawsuits if orders were not filled immediately , and once found that items Burke indignantly demanded had come in and Holmes had carted them off and used them without notifying anybody . That was the day Pam threatened to resign .  It looks like a pudding , grumbled Pam , after Sandy had mollified her and Burke had apologized for having made her fight needlessly with two transport-lines , a shipping department , and a vice-president in charge of sales . And they act like it was a baby!  Itll be a ship , said Sandy . You know what kind .  Ill believe it when I see it , said Pam . Then she demanded indignantly , Has Joe looked at you twice since this nonsense started ?  No , admitted Sandy . He works all the time . At night he has a receiver tuned to the beepings to make sure he knows if the broadcast changes again . The Russians are still trying to make a two-way contact . But the broadcast just keeps on , ignoring everybody . Then she said , Anyhow , Joes going to feel awful if it doesnt work . Ive got to be around to pick up the pieces of his vanity and put them together again .  Huh! said Pam . Catch me doing that!  At just that moment Holmes came into the office with a finger dripping blood . He had been supervising and , at the same time , assisting in the building of an additional section of laths and struts and he was annoyed with himself for the small injury which interfered with his work .  Pam did the bandaging . She cooed over him distressedly , and had him grinning before the dressing was finished . He went back to work very much pleased with himself .  I , said Sandy , wouldnt act like you just did!  Sister , darling , said Pam , I wont cramp your act . Dont you criticize mine! That large wounded character is as attractive as anything Ive seen in months .  But I feel , said Sandy , as if I hadnt seen Joe in years!  Their viewpoint was strictly feminine and geared to female ideas and aspirations . But , in fact , they were probably as satisfied as two girls could be . They were on the side lines of interesting happenings which were being prepared by interesting men . They were useful enough to the enterprise to belong to it without doing anything outstanding enough to amount to rivalry with the men . From a girls standpoint , it wasnt at all bad .  But neither Burke nor Holmes even faintly guessed at the appraisal of their work by Sandy and Pam . To Holmes , the task was fascinating because it was a ship he was building . It was not a beautiful object , to be sure . If the lath-and-plaster mould were removed , the thing inside it would look rather like an obese small whale . There were recesses in its rotund sides in which distinctly eccentric apparatus appeared . Its interior was even more curious . And still it was a ship . Holmes found deep satisfaction in fitting its interior parts into place . It was like , but not the same as , equipping a small vessel with fathometers , radars , direction-finders , air-conditioners , stoves , galleys , heads and refrigerators without getting it crowded .  To be sure , no seagoing ship would have sections of hydroponic wall-garden installed , nor would an auxiliary schooner normally have six pairs of closed-circuit television cameras placed outside for a view in each and every direction . This ship had such apparatus . But to Holmes the building of what Burke had designed was an extremely attractive task .  Burke had less fun . Hed set up a huge metal lathe in the construction shed , and he labored at carving out of a specially built-up Swedish-iron shaft a series of twenty-odd magnet-cores like the triple unit he considered successful . Each of the peculiar shapes had to be carved out of the shaft , and all had to remain part of the shaft when completed . Then each had to be wound with magnet-wire , coated with plastic as it was wound . Then a bronze tube had to be formed over all , with no play of any sort anywhere . The task required the workmanship of a jeweller and the patience of Job . And Burke had had enough experience with new constructions to be acutely doubtful that this would be right when it was done .  The Russians sent up a third space-probe , aimed at Asteroid M-387 . It functioned perfectly . Three days later , a fourth . Three days later still , a fifth . Their aim with the fifth was not too good .  The beeping sounds continued to come in from space . The second message remained the same but the crackling sounds changed . There was a systematic and consistent variation in what they apparently had to say . M .I .T . discovered the modification . When its report reached the newspapers , Sandy invaded the construction shed to show Burke the news account . Oil-smeared and harassed , he stopped work to read it .  Hell! he said querulously . I shouldve had somebody watching for this! I figured the second broadcast was telling us something that would change as time went on . Theyre telemetering something to us . Id guess theres an emergency or an ultimatum in the works , and this is telling how fast its coming to a crisis . But Im already working as fast as I can!  Some cases marked Instruments came this morning , Sandy told him . Theyre the solidest shipping cases I ever saw . And the bills for them!  Wire Keller , said Burke . Tell him theyre here and to come along .  Whos Keller ? asked Sandy . And whats his address ?  Burke blew up unreasonably , and Sandy said I quit! In seconds , he had apologized and assured Sandy that she was quite right and that he was an idiot . Of course she couldnt know who Keller was . Keller was the man who would install the instruments in the ship outside . Burke gave her his address . Sandy was not appeased .  Burke ran a grimy hand despairingly through his hair .  Sandy , he protested , bear with me just a little while! In just a few more days this thing will be finished , and Ill know whether Im the prize imbecile of history or whether Ive actually managed to do something worth while! Bear with me like you would with a half-wit or a delinquent child or something . Please , Sandy--  She turned her back on him and walked out of the shed . But she didnt quit . Burke turned back to his work .  The Russians sent up another probe . It went off course . There were now six unmanned Russian probes in emptiness , of which four were lined up reasonably well along the route which a manned probe , if one were sent up , should ultimately travel . The advance probes formed an ingenious approach to the problem of getting a man farther out in space than any man had been before , but it was horribly risky . But apparently the Russians could afford to take such risks . The Americans couldnt . They had a settled policy of spending a dollar instead of a man . It was humanitarian , but it had one drawback . There was a tendency to keep on spending dollars and not ever let a man take a chance .  The Russians had four fuel-carrying drones in line out in space . If a ship could grapple them in turn and refuel , it might make the journey to M-387 in eight or ten weeks instead of as many months . But it was not easy to imagine such a success . And as for getting back . . . .  The beeping sounds continued to be received by Earth .  A short man with thin hair arrived at Burke Development , Inc . His name was Keller , and his expression was pleasant enough , but he was so sparing of words as to seem almost speechless . Sandy watched as he unpacked the instruments in the massive shipping cases . The instruments themselves were meaningless to her . They had dials , and some had gongs , and one or two had unintelligible things printed on paper strips . At least one in the last category was a computer . Keller unpacked them reverently and made sure that not a speck of dust contaminated any one . When he carried them out to the hull , still concealed by the lath-and-plaster exterior mould , he walked with the solemn care of a man bearing treasure .  That day Sandy saw him talking to Burke . Burke spoke , and Keller smiled and nodded . Only once did he open his mouth to say something . Then he could not have said more than four words . He went happily back to his instruments .  The next day , Burke made what was intended to be a low-power test of the long iron bar hed machined so painstakingly and wound so carefully before enclosing it in the bronze outer case . Hed worked on it for more than two weeks .  He prepared the test very carefully . The six-inch test model had lain on a workbench and had been energized through a momentary-contact switch . The full-scale specimen was clamped in a great metal lathe , which in turn was shackled with half-inch steel cable to the foundations of the construction shed . If the pseudo-magnet flew anywhere this time it would have to break through a tremendous restraining force . The switch was discarded . A condenser would discharge through the windings via a rectifier . There would be a single damped surge of current of infinitesimal duration .  Holmes passed on the news . He got along very well with Pam these days . At first hed been completely careless of his appearance . Then Pam took measures to distract him from total absorption in the construction job , and he responded . Nowadays , he tended to work in coveralls and change into more formal attire before approaching the office . Sandy came upon him polishing his shoes , once , and she told Pam . Pam beamed .  Now he came lounging into the office and said amiably , The moment of truth has arrived , or will in minutes .  Sandy looked anxious . Pam said , Is that an invitation to look on at the kill ?  Burkes going to turn juice into the thing hes been winding by hand and jittering over . Hes worried . He can think of seven thousand reasons why it shouldnt work . But if it doesnt , hell be a pretty sick man . He glanced at Sandy . I think he could do with somebody to hold his hand at the critical moment .  Well go , said Sandy .  Pam got up from her desk .  She wont hold his hand , she explained to Holmes , but shell be there in case there are some pieces to be picked up . Of him .  They went across the open space to the construction shed . It was a perfectly commonplace morning . The very temporary mass of lumber and laths and plaster , forming a mould for something unseen inside , was the only unusual thing in sight . There were deep truck tracks by the shed . One of the workmen came out of the air-lock door on the bottom of the mould and lighted a cigarette .  No smoking inside , said Holmes . Were cementing things in place with plastic .  Sandy did not hear . She was first to enter the shed . Burke was moving around the object hed worked so long to make . It now appeared to be simply a piece of bronze pipe some fifteen feet long and eight inches in diameter , with closed ends . It lay in the bed of an oversized metal lathe , which was anchored in place by cables . Burke took a painstaking reading of the resistance of a pair of red wires , then of white ones , and then of black rubber ones , which stuck out of one end of the pipe .  The audience is here , said Holmes .  Burke nodded . He said almost apologetically , Im putting in a minimum of power . Maybe nothing will happen . Its pretty silly .  Sandys hands twisted one within the other when he turned his back to her . He made connections , took a deep breath , and said in a strained voice , Here goes .  He flipped a switch .  There was a cracking sound . It was horribly loud . There was a crash . Bricks began to fall . The end of the metal-lathe bounced out of a corner . Steel cables gave off high-pitched musical notes which went down in tone as the stress on them slackened . One end of the lathe was gone--snapped off , broken , flung away into a corner . There was a hole in the brick wall , over a foot in diameter .  The fifteen-foot object was gone . But they heard a high-pitched shrilling noise , which faded away into the distance .  That afternoon the Russians announced that their manned space-probe had taken off for Asteroid M-387 . Naturally , they delayed the announcement until they were satisfied that the launching had gone well . When they made their announcement , the probe was fifty thousand miles out , they had received a message from its pilot , and they predicted that the probe would land on M-387 in a matter of seven weeks .  In a remote small corner of the afternoon newspapers there was an item saying that a meteorite had fallen in a ploughed field some thirty miles from where Burkes contrivance broke loose . It made a crater twenty feet across . It could not be examined because it was covered with frost .  Burke had the devil of a time recovering it . But he needed it badly . Especially since the Russian probe had gone out from Earth . He explained that it was a shipment to his plant , which had fallen out of an aeroplane , but the owner of the ploughed field was dubious . Burke had to pay him a thousand dollars to get him to believe .  That night he had his recurrent dream again . The fluting signals were very clear .     Chapter 4   The public abruptly ceased to be interested in news of the signals . Rather , it suddenly wanted to stop thinking about them . The public was scared . Throughout all human history , the most horrifying of all ideas has been the idea of something which was as intelligent as a man , but wasnt human . Evil spirits , ghosts , devils , werewolves , ghouls--all have roused maddened terror wherever they were believed in . Because they were intelligent but not men .  Now , suddenly , the world seemed to realize that there was a Something out on a tiny frozen rock in space . It signaled plaintively to Earth . It had to be intelligent to be able to send a signal for two hundred seventy million miles . But it was not a man . Therefore it was a monster . Therefore it was horrible . Therefore it was deadly and intolerable and scarey , and humans abruptly demanded not to hear any more about it . Perhaps they thought that if they didnt think about it , it would go away .  Newspaper circulations dropped . News-magazine sales practically vanished . A flood of hysterical letters demanded that the broadcasting networks leave such revolting things off the air . And this reaction was not only in America . Violent anti-American feeling arose in Europe , which psychologists analyzed as resentment caused by the fact that the Americans had answered the first broadcast . If they hadnt answered the first , there wouldnt have been a second . But also , even more violent anti-Russian feeling rose up , because the Russians had started a man off to meddle with the monster who piped so pleadingly . This antipathy to space caused a minor political upset in the Kremlin itself , where a man with a name ending in ov was degraded to much lower official rank and somebody with a name ending in sky took his place . This partly calmed the Russian public but had little effect anywhere else . The world was frightened . It looked for a victim , or victims , for its fear . Once upon a time , witches were burned to ease the terrors of ignorance , and plague-spreaders were executed in times of pestilence to assure everybody that now the plague would cease since somebody had been killed for spreading it .  Organizations came into being with the official and impassioned purpose of seeing that space research ceased immediately . Even more violent organizations demanded the punishment of everybody who had ever considered space travel a desirable thing . Congress cut some hundreds of millions from a guided-missile-space-exploration appropriation as a starter . A poor devil of a crackpot in Santa Monica , California , revealed what he said was a spaceship hed built in his back yard to answer the signals from M-387 . He intended to charge a quarter admission to inspect it , using the money to complete the drive apparatus . The thing was built of plywood and could not conceivably lift off the ground , but a mob wrecked his house , burned the puerile spaceship and would have lynched its builder if theyd thought to look in a cellar vegetable closet . Other crackpots who were more sensitive to public feelings announced the picking up of messages addressed to the distant Something . The messages , said this second class of crackpot , were reports from spies who had been landed on Earth from flying saucers during the past few decades . They did not explain how they were able to translate them . A rush of flying-saucer sightings followed inevitably--alleged to be landing-parties from M-387--and in Peoria , Illinois , a picnicking party sighted an unidentified flying object shaped like a soup spoon , the handle obviously being its tail . Experienced newspapermen anticipated reports of the sighting of unidentified flying objects shaped like knives and forks as soon as somebody happened to think of it .  Sandy called a conference on the subject of security . She did not look well , nowadays . She worried . Other people thought about the messages from space , but Sandy had to think of something more concrete . Six months earlier , the construction going on within a plaster of Paris mould would have been laughed at , tolerantly , and some hopeful people might have been respectful about it . But now it was something utterly intolerable to public opinion . Newspapers whod lost circulation by talking sanely about space travel now got it back by denouncing the people whod answered the first broadcast . And naturally , with the whole idea of outer space agitatedly disapproved , everybody connected with it was suspected of subversion .  A reporter called up today , said Sandy . He said hed like to do a feature story on Burke Developments new research triumph--the new guided missile that flew thirty miles and froze everything around where it landed . I said it fell out of an aeroplane and the last completed project was for Interiors , Inc . Then he said that hed been talking to one of Mr . Holmes men and the man said something terrific was under way .  Burke looked uneasy . Holmes said uncomfortably , Theres no law against what were building , but somebody may introduce a bill in Congress any day .  That would be reasonable under other circumstances . Theres a time for things to be discovered . They shouldnt be accomplished too soon . But the time for the ship out there is right now! Burke said .  Pam raised her eyebrows . Yes ?  Those signals have to be checked up on , explained Burke . Its necessary now . But it could have been bad if our particular enterprise had started , say , two years ago . Just think what would have happened if atomic fission had been worked out in peacetime ten years before World War Two! Scientific discoveries were published then as a matter of course . Everybodyd have known how to make atom bombs . Hitler would have had them , and so would Mussolini . How many of us would be alive ?  Sandy interrupted , The reporter wants to do a feature story on what Burke Development is making . I said you were working on a bomb shelter for quantity production . He asked if the rocket you shot off through the construction-shed wall was part of it . I said thered been no rocket fired . He didnt believe me .  Who would ? asked Holmes .  Hmmmmm , said Burke . Tell him to come look at what were doing . The ship can pass for a bomb shelter . The wall-garden units make sense . Im going to dig a big hole in the morning to test the drive-shaft in . Itll look like I intend to bury everything . A bomb shelter should be buried .  You mean youll let him inside ? demanded Sandy .  Sure! said Burke . All inventors are expected to be idiots . A lot of them are . Hell think Im making an impossibly expensive bomb shelter , much too costly for a private family to buy . It will be typical of the inventive mind as reporters think of it . Anyhow , everybodys always willing to believe other people fools . Thatll do the trick!  Pam said blandly , Sandy and I live in a boardinghouse , Joe . You dont ask about such things , but an awfully nice man moved in a couple of days ago--right after that shaft got away and went flying thirty miles all by itself . The nice man has been trying to get acquainted .  Holmes growled , and looked both startled and angry when he realized it .  Pam added cheerfully , Most evenings Ive been busy , but I think Ill let him take me to the movies . Just so I can make us all out to be idiots , she added .  Ill make the hole big enough to be convincing , said Burke . Sandy , you make inquiries for a rigger to lift and move the bomb shelter into its hole when its ready . If we seem about to bury it , nobody should suspect us of ambitions they wont like .  Why the hole , really ? asked Sandy .  To put the shaft in , said Burke . Ive got to get it under control or it wont be anything more than a bomb shelter .  Keller , the instrument man , had listened with cheerful interest and without speaking a word . Now he made an indefinite noise and looked inquiringly at Burke . Burke said , explanatorily , The shaft seems to be either on or off--either a magnet that doesnt quite magnetize , or something thats hell on wheels . It flew thirty miles without enough power supplied to it to make it quiver . That power came from somewhere . I think theres a clue in the fact that it froze everything around where it landed , in spite of traveling fast enough to heat up from air-friction alone . Ive got some ideas about it .  Keller nodded . Then he said urgently , Broadcast ?  Burke frowned , and turned to Sandy . Thats part of the broadcast from space that changes--is it still changing ?  Still changing , said Sandy .  I didnt think to ask you to keep a check on that . Thanks for thinking of it , Sandy . Maybe someday I can make up to you for what youve been going through .  I doubt it very much , said Sandy grimly . Ill call the reporter back .  She waited for them to leave . When theyd gone , she moved purposefully toward the telephone .  Pam said , Did you hear that growl when I said Id go to the movies with somebody else ? Im having fun , Sandy!  Im not , said Sandy .  Youre too efficient , the younger sister said candidly . Youre indispensable . Burke couldnt begin to be able to put this thing through without you . And thats the trouble . You should be irresistible instead of essential .  Not with Joe , said Sandy bitterly .  She picked up the telephone to call the newspaper . Pam looked very , very reflective .  There was a large deep pit close by the plaster mould when the reporter came next afternoon . A local rigger had come a little earlier and was still there , estimating the cost for lifting up the contents of the mould and lowering it precisely in place to be buried as a bomb shelter under test should be . It was a fortunate coincidence , because the reporter brought two other men who he said were civilian defense officials . They had come to comment on the quality of the bomb shelter under development . It was not too convincing a statement .  When they left , Burke was not happy . They knew too much about the materials and equipment hed ordered . One man had let slip the fact that he knew about the very expensive computer Burke had bought . It could have no conceivable use in a bomb shelter . Both men painstakingly left it to Burke to mention the thirty-mile flight of a bronze object which arrived coated with frost of such utter frigidity that it appeared to be liquid-air snow instead of water-ice . Burke did not mention it . He was excessively uneasy when the reporters car took them away .  He went into the office . Pam was in the midst of a fit of the giggles .  One of them , she explained , is the nice man who moved into the boardinghouse . He wants to take me to the movies . Did you notice that they came when it ought to be my lunchtime ? He asked when I went to lunch  . . .  Holmes came in . He scowled .  One of my men says that one of those characters has been buying him drinks and asking questions about what were doing .  Burke scowled too .  We can let your men go home in three days more .  Im going to start loading up , Holmes announced abruptly . You dont know how to stow stuff . Youre not a yachtsman .  I havent got the shaft under control yet , said Burke .  Youll get it , grunted Holmes .  He went out . Pam giggled again .  He doesnt want me to go to the movies with the nice man from Security , she told Burke . But I think Id better . Ill let him ply me with popcorn and innocently let slip that Sandy and I know youve been warned that bomb shelters wont find a mass market unless they sell for less than the price of an extra bathroom . But if you want to go broke we dont care .  Give me three days more , said Burke harassedly .  Well try , said Sandy suddenly . Pam can fix up a double date with one of her friends friends and well both work on them .  Burke frowned absorbedly and went out . Sandy looked indignant . He hadnt protested .  Burke got Holmes four workmen out of the ship and had them help him roll the bronze shaft to the pit and let it down onto a cradle of timbers . Now if it moved it would have to penetrate solid earth .  The most trivial of computations showed that when the bronze shaft had flown thirty miles , it hadnt done it on the energy of a condenser shorted through its coils . The energy had come from somewhere else . Burke had an idea where it was .  Presently he verified it . The cores and windings hed adapted from a transparent hand-weapon seen in an often-repeated dream--those cores and windings did not make electromagnets . They made something for which there was not yet a name . When current flows through a standard electromagnet , the poles of its atoms are more or less aligned . They tend to point in a single direction . But in this arrangement of wires and iron no magnetism resulted , yet , the random motion of the atoms in their framework of crystal structure was coördinated . In any object above absolute zero all the atoms and their constituent electrons and nuclei move constantly in all directions . In such a core as Burke had formed and repeated along the shafts length , they all tried to move in one direction at the same time . Simultaneously , a terrific surge of current appeared in the coils . A high-speed poleward velocity developed in all the substance of the shaft . It was the heat-energy contained in the metal , all turned instantly into kinetic energy . And when its heat-energy was transformed to something else , the shaft got cold .  Once this fact was understood , control was easy . A single variable inductance in series with the windings handled everything . In a certain sense , the gadget was a magnet with negative--minus--self-inductance . When a plus inductance in series made the self-inductance zero , neither plus nor minus , the immensely powerful device became docile . A small current produced a mild thrust , affecting only part of the random heat-motion of atoms and molecules . A stronger current produced a greater one . The resemblance to an electromagnet remained . But the total inductance must stay close to zero or utterly violent and explosive forward thrust would develop , and it was calculable only in thousands of gravities .  Burke had worked for three weeks to make the thing , but he developed a control system for it in something under four hours .  That same night they got the bronze shaft into the ship . It fitted perfectly into the place left for it . Burke knew now exactly what he was doing . He set up his controls . He was able to produce so minute a thrust that the lath-and-plaster mould merely creaked and swayed . But he knew that he could make the whole mass surge unstoppably from its place .  Holmes sent his workmen home . Sandy and Pam went to the movies with two very nice men who pumped them deftly of all sorts of erroneous information about Burke and Holmes and Keller and what they were about . The nice men did not believe that information , but they did believe that Sandy and Pam believed it . For themselves , the combination of an object made by Burke which flew thirty miles plus the presence of Holmes , who built plastic yachts , and the arrival of Keller to adjust instruments of which they had a complete list--these things could not be overlooked . But they did feel sorry for two nice and not over-bright girls who might be involved in very serious trouble .  Holmes and Burke installed directional controls , wiring , recording instruments , etc . Stores and water and oxygen , for emergency use only , went into the lath-and-plaster construction . Holmes took a hammer and chisel and painstakingly cracked the mould so that the top half could be lifted off , leaving the bottom half exposed to the open air and sky .  Then the broadcast from space cut off . It had been coming continuously for something like five weeks; one sharp , monotonous note every two seconds , with a longer , fluting broadcast every seventy-nine minutes . Now a third , new message began . It was yet another grouping of the musical tones , with a much longer interval of specific crackling sounds .  Keller had adjusted every instrument and zestfully retested them over and over . Burke asked him to see if the third space message compared in any way with the second . Keller put them through a hook-up of instruments , beaming to himself , and the answer began to appear .  Newspapers burst into new headlines . Ultimatum from Space they thundered . Threats from Alien Space Travelers . And as they presented the situation it seemed believable that the third message from the void was a threat .  The first had been a call , requiring an answer . When the answer went out from Earth , a second message replaced the call . It contained not only flute tones which might be considered to represent words , but cracklings which might be the equivalent of numbers . The continuous beepings between repetitions of the second message were plainly a directional signal to be followed to the message source .  In this context , the newspapers furiously asserted that the third message was a threat . The first had been merely a summons , the second had been a command to repair to the signaling entities , and the third was a stern reiteration of the command , reinforced by threats .  The human race does not take kindly to threats , especially when it feels helpless . In the United States , there was such explosive resentment as to require spread-eagle oratory by all public figures . The President declared that every space missile in store had been fitted with atomic-fusion warheads and that any alien spacecraft which appeared in American skies would be shot down immediately . Congress reported out of committee a bill for rocket weapons which was stalled for six days because every senator and representative wanted to make a speech in its favor . It was the largest appropriation bill ever passed by Congress , which less than five weeks before had cut two hundred millions out of a guided-missile-space-exploration budget .  And in Europe there was frenzy .  For Burke and Holmes and Sandy and Pam and the smiling , inarticulate Keller , the matter was deadly serious . Fury such as the public felt constituted a witch-hunt in itself . Suspicious private persons overwhelmed the FBI and the Space Agency with information about characters they were sure were giving military secrets to the space travelers on M-387 . There were reports of aliens skulking about American cities wearing luxuriant whiskers and dark glasses to conceal their non-human features . Artists , hermits , and mere amateur beard-growers found it wise to shave , and spirit mediums , fortunetellers and , in the South , herb doctors reaped harvests by the sale of ominous predictions and infallible advice on how to escape annihilation from space .  And Burke Development , Inc . , was building something that neither Civilian Defense nor the FBI believed was a bomb shelter .  The three days Burke had needed passed . A fourth . He and Holmes practically abandoned sleep to get everything finished inside the plaster mould . Keller happily completed his graphs and took them to Burke . They showed that the cracklings , which presumably meant numbers , had been expanded . What they said was now told on a new scale . If the numbers had meant months or years , they now meant days and hours . If they had meant millions of miles , they now meant thousands or hundreds .  Burke was struggling with these implications when there was a tapping at the air-lock , through which all entry and egress from the ship took place . Holmes opened the inner door . Sandy and Pam crawled through the lock which lay on its side instead of upright . Sandy looked at Burke .  Pam said amiably , We figured the job was about finished and we wanted to see it . How do you fasten this door ?  Holmes showed her . The vessel that had been built inside the mould did not seem as large as the outside structure promised . It looked queer , too , because everything lay on its side . There were two compartments with a ladder between , but the ladder lay on the floor . The wall-gardens looked healthy under the fluorescent lamps which kept the grass and vegetation flourishing . There were instrument dials everywhere .  Sandy went to Burkes side .  Were all but done , said Burke tiredly , and Kellers just about proved what the signals are .  Can we go with you ? asked Sandy .  Of course not , said Burke . The first message was a distress call . It had to be . Only in a distress call would somebody go into details so any listener would know it was important . It called for help and said who needed it , and why , and where .  Pam turned to Holmes . Can that air-lock be opened from outside ?  It couldnt . Not when it was fastened , as now .  Somebody answered that call from Earth , said Burke heavily , and the second message told more about what was wrong . The clickings , we think , are numbers that told how long help could be waited for , or something on that order . And then there was a beacon signal meant to lead whoever was coming to help to that place .  Keller smiled pleasantly at Pam . He made an electrical connection and zestfully checked the result .  Now theres a third message , said Burke . Times running out for whoever needs whatever help is called for . The clickings that seem to be numbers have changed . The--what you might call the scale of reportage--is new . Theyre telling us just how long they can wait or just how bad their situation is . Theyre saying that time is running out and theyre saying , Hurry!  There was a thumping sound . Only Sandy and Pam looked unsurprised . Burke stared .  Sandy said firmly , Thats the police , Joe . Weve been going to the movies with people who want to talk about you . Yesterday one of them confided to us that you were dangerous , and since he told us to get away from the office , we did . There might be shooting . He tipped us a little while ago .  Burke swore . There were other thumpings . Louder ones . They were on the air-lock door .  If you try to put us out , said Sandy calmly , youll have to open that door and theyll try to fight their way in--and then wherell you be ?  Keller turned from the checking of the last instrument He looked at the others with excited eyes . He waited .  I dont know what they can arrest you for , said Sandy , and maybe they dont either , unless its unauthorized artillery practice . But you cant put us out! And you know darn well that unless you do something theyll chop their way in!  Burke said , Dammit , theyre not going to stop me from finding out if this thing works!  He squirmed in a chair which had its base firmly fastened to a wall and began to punch buttons .  Hold fast! he said angrily . At least well see . . . .  There were loud snapping sounds . There were creakings . The room stirred . It turned in a completely unbelievable fashion . Violent crashings sounded outside . Abruptly , a small television screen before Burke acquired an image . It was of the outside world reeling wildly . Holmes seized a hand-hold and grabbed Pam . He kept her from falling as a side wall became the floor , and what had been the floor became a side wall , with the ceiling another . It seemed that all the cosmos changed , though only walls and floors changed places .  Suddenly everything seemed normal but new . The surface underfoot was covered with a rubber mat . The hydroponic wall-garden sections were now vertical . Burke sat upright , and something over his head rotated a half-turn and was still . But it became coated with frost .  More crashes . More small television screens acquired images . They showed the office of Burke Development , Inc . , against a tilted landscape . The landscape leveled . Another showed the construction shed . One showed cloud formations , very bright and distinct . And two others showed a small , armed , formidable body of men instinctively backing away from the outside television lens .  So far , said Burke , it works . Now--  There was a sensation as of a rapidly rising elevator . Such a sensation usually lasts for part of a second . This kept on . One of the six television screens suddenly showed a view of Burke Development from straight overhead . The buildings and men and the four-acre enclosure dwindled rapidly . They were very tiny indeed and nearly all of the town was in the cameras field of vision when a vague whiteness , a cloud , moved in between .  The devil! said Burke . Now theyll alert fighter planes and rocket installations and decide that were either traitors or aliens in disguise and better be shot down . I think we simply have to go on!  Keller made gestures , his eyes bright . Burke looked worried .  It shouldnt take more than ten minutes to get a Nike aloft and after us . We must have been picked up by radar already . . . . Well head north . We have to , anyhow .  But he was wrong about the ten minutes . It was fifteen before a rocket came into view , pouring out enormous masses of drive-fumes . It flung itself toward the ship .     Chapter 5   From a sufficient height and a sufficient distance , the rockets repeated attacks must have appeared like the strikings and twistings of a gigantic snake . It left behind it a writhing trail of fumes which was convincingly serpentine . It climbed and struck , and climbed and struck , like a monstrous python flinging itself furiously at some invisible prey . Six , seven , eight times it plunged frenziedly at the minute egg-shaped ship which scuttled for the heavens . Each time it missed and writhed about to dart again .  Then its fuel gave out and for all intents and purposes it ceased to exist . The thick , opaque trail it left behind began to dissipate . The path of vapor scattered . It spread to rags and tatters of unsubstantiality through which the rocket plummeted downward in the long fall which is a spent rockets ending .  Burke cautiously cut down the drive and awkwardly turned the ship on its side , heading it toward the north . The state of things inside the ship was one of intolerable tenseness .  Im a new driver , said Burke , and that was a tough bit of driving to do . He glanced at the exterior-pressure meter . Theres no air outside to register . We must be fifty or sixty miles high and maybe still rising . But were not leaking air .  Actually the plastic ship was eighty miles up . The sunlit world beneath it showed white patches of cloud in patterns a meteorologist would have found interesting . Burke could see the valley of the St . Lawrence River between the white areas . But the Earths surface was curiously foreshortened . What was beneath seemed utterly flat , and at the edge of the world all appeared distorted and unreal .  Holmes , still pale , asked , Howd we get away from that rocket ?  We accelerated , said Burke . It was a defensive rocket . It was designed to knock down jet bomb carriers or ballistic missiles which travel at a constant speed . Target-seeking missiles can lock onto the radar echo from a coasting ship , or one going at its highest speed because their computers predict where their target , traveling at constant speed , can be intercepted . We were never there . We were accelerating . Missile-guidance systems cant measure acceleration and allow for it . They shouldnt have to .  Four of the six television screens showed dark sky with twinkling lights in it . On one there was the dim outline of the sun , reversed to blackness because its light was too great to be registered in a normal fashion . The other screen showed Earth .  There was a buzzing , and Keller looked at Burke .  Rocket ? asked Burke . Keller shook his head . Radar ? Keller nodded .  The DEW line , most likely , said Burke in a worried tone . I dont know whether theyve got rockets that can reach us . But I know fighter planes cant get this high . Maybe they can throw a spread of air-to-air rockets , though . . . . I dont know their range .  Sandy said unsteadily , They shouldnt do this to us! Were not criminals! At least they should ask us who we are and what were doing!  They probably did , said Burke , and we didnt answer . See if you can pick up some voices , Keller .  Keller twirled dials and set indicators . Voices burst into speech . Reporting UFO sighted extreme altitude coördinates--First rocket exhausted fuel in multiple attacks and fell , sir . Another voice , very brisk , Thirty-second squadron , scramble! Keep top altitude and get under it . If it descends within range , blast it! Another voice said crisply , Coördinates three-seven Jacob , one-nine Alfred . . . .  Keller turned the voices down to mutters because they were useless .  Burke said , Hell! We ought to land somewhere and check over the ship . Keller , can you give me a microphone and a wavelength somebody will be likely to pick up ?  Keller shrugged and picked up masses of wire . He began to work on an as yet unfinished wiring job . Evidently , the ship was not near enough to completion to be capable of a call to ground . It had taken off with many things not finished . Burke , at the controls , found it possible to think of a number of items that should have been examined exhaustively before the ship left the mould in which it had been made . He worried .  Pam said in a strange voice , I thought I might rate as a heroine for stowing away on this voyage , but I didnt think wed have to dodge rockets and fighter planes to get away!  There was no comment .  Im a beginner at navigation , said Burke a little later , more worried than before . I know we have to go out over the north magnetic pole , but how the hell do I find that ?  Keller beamed . He dropped his wiring job and went to the imposing bank of electronic instruments . He set one , and then another , and then a third . The action , of course , was similar to that of an airline pilot when he tunes in broadcasting stations in different cities . From each , a directional reading can be taken . Where the lines of direction cross , there the transport plane must be . But Keller turned to shortwave transmitters whose transmissions could be picked up in space . Presently , eighty miles high , he wrote a latitude and longitude neatly on a slip of paper , wrote North magnetic pole 93°W , 71°N , nearly , and after that a course .  Hm , said Burke . Thanks .  Then there was a relative silence inside the ship . Only a faint mutter of voices came from assorted speakers that Keller had first turned on and then turned down , and a small humming sound from a gyro . When they listened , they could also hear a high sweet musical tone . Burke shifted this control here , and that control there , and lifted his hands . The ship moved on steadily . He checked this and that and the other thing . He was pleased . But there were innumerable things to be checked . Holmes went down the ladder to the other compartment below . There were details to be looked into there , too .  One of the screens portrayed Earth from a height of seventy miles instead of eighty , now . Others pictured the heavens , with very many stars shining unwinkingly out of blackness . Keller got at his wires again and resumed the work of installing a ship-to-ground transmitter and its connection to an exterior-reflecting antenna .  Sandy watched Burke as he moved about , testing one thing after another . From time to time he glanced at the screens which had to serve in the place of windows . Once he went back to the control-board and changed an adjustment .  We dropped down ten miles , he explained to Sandy . And I suspect were being trailed by jets down below .  Holmes meticulously inspected all storage places . Hed packed them when the ship lay on her side .  Burke read an instrument and said with satisfaction , Were running on sunshine!  He meant that in empty space certain aluminum plates on the outside of the hull were picking up heat from the naked sun . The use of the drive-shaft lowered its temperature . Metallic connection with the outside plates conducted heat inward from those plates . The drive-shaft was cold to the touch , but it could drop four hundred degrees Fahrenheit before it ceased to operate as a drive . It was gratifying that it had cooled so little up to this moment .  Later Keller tapped Burke on the shoulder and jerked his thumb upward .  We go up now ? asked Burke .  Keller nodded . Burke carefully swung the ship to aim vertically . The views of solid Earth slid from previous screens to new ones . The stars and the dark object which was the sun also moved across their screens to vanish and reappear on others . Then Burke touched the drive-control . Once more they had the sensation of being in a rising elevator . And at just that moment spots appeared on the barren , icy , totally flattened terrain below .  They were rocket-trails from target-seeking missiles which had reached the area of the north magnetic pole by herculean effort and were aimed at the radar-detected little ship by the heavy planes that carried them .  From the surface of the Earth , it would have seemed that monstrous columns of foaming white appeared and rose with incredible swiftness toward the heavens . They reached on , up and up and up , seeming to draw closer together as they became smaller in the distance , until all eight of them seemed to merge into a single point of infinite whiteness in the sunshine above the worlds blanket of air .  But nothing happened . Nothing . The ship did not accelerate as fast as the rockets , but it had started first and it kept up longer . It went scuttling away to emptiness and the bottoms of the towers of rocket-smoke drifted away and away over the barren landscape all covered with ice and snow .  When Earth looked like a huge round ball that did not even seem very near , with a night side that was like a curious black chasm among the stars , the atmosphere of tension inside the ship diminished . Keller completed his wiring of a ship-to-ground transmitter . He stood up , brushed off his hands and beamed .  The little ship continued on . Its temperature remained constant . The air in it smelled of growing green stuff . It was moist . It was warm . Keller turned a knob and a tiny , beeping noise could be heard . Dials pointed , precisely .  We couldnt go on our true course earlier , Burke told Sandy , because we had to get out beyond the Van Allen bands of cosmic particles in orbit around the world . Pretty deadly stuff , that radiation! In theory , though , all we have to do now is swing onto our proper course and follow those beepings home . We ought to be in harmless emptiness here . Do you want to call Washington ?  She stared .  We need help to navigate--or astrogate , said Burke . Call them , Sandy . Ill get on the wire when a general answers .  Sandy went jerkily to the transmitter just connected . She began to speak steadily , Calling Earth! Calling Earth! The spaceship you just shot all those rockets at is calling! Calling Earth!  It grew monotonous , but eventually a suspicious voice demanded further identification .  It was a peculiar conversation . The five in the small spaceship were considered traitors on Earth because they had exercised the traditional right of American citizens to go about their own business unhindered . It happened that their private purposes ran counter to the emotional state of the public . Hence voices berated Sandy and furiously demanded that the ship return immediately . Sandy insisted on higher authority and presently an official voice identified itself as general so-and-so and sternly commanded that the ship acknowledge and obey orders to return to Earth . Burke took the transmitter .  My names Burke , he said mildly . If you can arrange some sort of code , Ill tell you how to find the plans , and Ill give you the instructions youll need to build more ships like this . They can follow us out . I think they should . I believe that this is more important than anything else you can think of at the moment .  Silence . Then more sternness . But ultimately the official voice said , Ill get a code expert on this .  Burke handed the microphone to Sandy .  Take over . Weve got to arrange a cipher so nobody who listens in can learn about official business . We may use a social security number for a key , or the name of your maiden aunts first sweetheart , or something we know and Washington can find out but that nobody else can . Hm . Your last years car-license number might be a starter . They can seal up the records on that!  Sandy took over the job . What was transmitted to Earth , of course , could be picked up anywhere over an entire hemisphere . Somebody would assuredly pass on what they overheard to , say , nations the United States would rather have behind it than ahead of it in space-travel equipment . Burkes suggestion of a cipher and instructions changed his entire status with authority . Theyd rather have had him come back , but this was second best , and they took it .  From Burkes standpoint it was the only thing to do . He had no official standing to lend weight to his claim that lunatic magnet-cores with insanely complicated windings would amount to space-drive units . If he returned , in the nature of things there would be a long delay before mere facts could overcome theoreticians convictions . But now he was forty-five thousand miles out from Earth .  He had changed course to home on the beeping signals from M-387 , was accelerating at one full gravity and had been doing so for forty-five minutes . And the small ship already had a velocity of twenty miles per second and was still going up . All the rockets that men had made , plus the Russian manned-probe drifting outward now , had become as much outdated for space travel as flint arrowheads are for war .  Burke returned to the microphone when Sandy left it to get a pencil and paper .  By the way , he said briskly . We can keep on accelerating indefinitely at one gravity . Weve got radars . We got them from-- He named the supplier . Now we want advice on how fast we can risk traveling before well be going too fast to dodge meteors or whatnot that the radar may detect . Get that figured out for us , will you ?  He gave back the instrument to Sandy and returned to his inspection of every item of functioning equipment in the ship . He found one or two trivial things to be bettered . The small craft went on in a singularly matter-of-fact fashion . If it had been a bomb shelter buried in the pit beside the mould in which it was built , there would have been very little difference in the feel of things . The constant acceleration substituted perfectly for gravity . The six television screens , to be sure , pictured incredible things outside , but television screens often picture incredible things . The wall-gardens looked green and flourishing . The pumps were noiseless . There were no moving parts in the drive . The gyro held everything steady . There was no vibration .  Nobody could remain upset in such an unexciting environment . Presently Pam explored the living quarters below . Holmes took his place in the control-chair , but found no need to touch anything .  Some time later Sandy reported , Joe , they say we must be lying , but if we can keep on accelerating , wed better not hit over four hundred miles a second . They say we can then swing end for end and decelerate down to two hundred , and then swing once more and build up to four again . But they insist that we ought to return to Earth .  They dont mention shooting rockets at us , do they ? asked Burke . I thought they wouldnt . Just say thanks and go on working out a code .  Sandy set to work with pencil and paper . Federal agents would be moving , now , to impound all official records that were in any way connected with any of the five on the ship . The key to the code would be contained in such records . It would be an agglomeration of such items as Burkes grandmothers maiden name , Holmes social-security number , the name of a street Burke had lived on some years before , the exact amount of his federal income taxes the previous year , the title of a book third from the end on the second shelf of a bookcase in Kellers apartment , and such unconsidered items as most people can remember with a little effort , but which can only be found out by people who know where to look . These people would keep anybody else from looking in the same places . Such a code would be clumsy to work with , but it would be unbreakable .  It took hours to establish it without the mention of a single word included in the lengthy key . The ship reached four hundred miles a second , turned about , and began to cut down its speed again .  Pam spoke from beside an electric stove , Dinners ready! Come and get it!  They dined; Sandy weary , Burke absorbed and inevitably worried , Holmes placid and amiable , and Keller beaming and interested in all that went on , which was practically nothing .  They did not see the stars direct , because television cameras were preferable to portholes . Earth had become very small , and as it swung ever more nearly into a direct line between the ship and the sun , night filled more of its disk until only a hairline of sunshine showed at one edge . The microwave receivers ceased to mutter . The working astronomers on Earth whod sent a message to M-387 were suddenly relieved of their disgrace and set to work again to equip the West Virginia radar telescope for continuous communication with Burkes ship . Other technicians began to prepare multiple receptors to pick up the ships signals from hitherto unprecedented distances for human two-way communication .  And on Earth an official statement went out from high authority . It announced that a hurriedly completed American ship was on the way to M-387 to investigate the signals from space . It announced that measures long in preparation were now in use , and that an invincible fleet of spacecraft would be completed in months , whereas they had not been hoped for for another generation . An unexpected breakthrough had made it possible to advance the science of space travel by many decades , and a fleet to explore all the planets as well as M-387 was already under construction . It was almost true that they were . The blueprints of Burkes ship had been flown to Washington from the plant , and an enormous number of replicas of the egg-shaped vessel were ordered to be begun immediately , even before the theory of the drive was understood .  There was one minor hitch . A legal-minded official protested that Congressional appropriations had been for rocket-driven spaceships only , and the money appropriated could not be used for other than rockets . An executive order settled the matter . Then theorists began to object to the principle of the drive . It contradicted well-established scientific beliefs . It could not work .  It did , but there was violent opposition to the fact .  Publicly , of course , the shock of such an about-face by the national government was extreme . But newspapers flashed new headlines . U .S . SHIP SPEEDING TO QUERY ALIENS! Lesser heads announced , Critical Velocity Exceeded! Russian Probe Already Passed! The last was not quite true . The Russian manned probe had started out ten days before . Burke hadnt overtaken it yet .  Broadcasters issued special bulletins , and two networks canceled top evening programs to schedule interviews with prominent scientists whod had nothing whatever to do with what Burke had managed to achieve .  In Europe , obviously , the political effect was stupendous . Russia was reduced to impassioned claims that the ship had been built from Russian plans , using Russian discoveries , which had been stolen by imperialistic secret agents . And the heads of the Russian spy system were disgraced for not having , in fact , stolen the plans and discoveries from the Americans . All other operatives received threats of what would happen to them if they didnt repair that omission . These threats so scared half a dozen operatives that they defected and told all they knew , thereby wrecking the Russian spy system for the time being .  Essentially , however , the recovery of confidence in America was as extravagant as the previous unhappy desire to hear no more about space . Burke , Holmes , Keller , Sandy and Pam became national heroes and heroines within eighteen hours after guided missiles had failed to shoot them down . The only criticism came from a highly conservative clergyman who hoped that other young girls would not imitate Sandys and Pams disregard of convention and maintained that a married woman should have gone along to chaperon them .  The atmosphere in the ship , however , was that of respectability carried to the point where things were dull . The lower compartment of the ship , being smaller , was inevitably appropriated by Sandy and Pam . They retired when the ship was twenty hours out from Earth . Each of them had prepared for stowing away by wearing extra garments in layers .  Funny , said Pam , yawning as they made ready to turn in , I thought it was going to be exciting . But its just like a rather full day at the office .  Which , said Sandy , Im quite used to .  I do think you ought to have barged in when they designed the ship , Sandy . Theres not one mirror in it!  In the upper compartment Keller took his place in the control-chair and took a trick of duty . It consisted solely of looking at the instruments and listening to the beeping noises which came from remoteness every two seconds , and the still completely cryptic broadcasts which came every seventy-nine minutes . It wasnt exciting . There was nothing to be excited about . But somebody had to be on watch .  On the second day out , Washington was ready to use the new code . The West Virginia radar bowl was powered to handle communications again . Sandy painstakingly took down the gibberish that came in and decoded it . From then on she worked at the coding and transmission of messages and the reception and decoding of others . Presently Pam relieved her at the job . Pam tended to be bored because Holmes was as much absorbed in the business of keeping anything from happening as was Burke .  The messages were almost entirely requests for , and answers to requests for , details about the ship plans . The United States had not yet completed a duplicate drive-shaft . Machinists labored to reproduce the cores , which would then have to be wound in the complicated fashion the plans described . But it was an unhappy experience for the scientific minds assigned to duplicate Burkes ship . No woman ever followed a recipe without making some change . Very few physicists can duplicate anothers apparatus without itching to change it . There were six copies of the drive under construction at the same time , at the beginning . Four were made by skeptics , who adhered to the original plans with strict accuracy . They were sure theyd prove Burke wrong . Two were improved in the making . The four , when finished , worked beautifully . The two doctored versions did not . But still there was fretful discussion of the theory of the drive . It seemed flatly to contradict Newtons law that every action has a reaction of equal moment and opposite sign--a law at least as firmly founded as the law of the conservation of energy . But that had lately been revised into the law of the conservation of energy and matter , which now was gospel . Burkes theory required the Newtonian law to be restated to read every action of a given force has a reaction of the same force , of the same moment , and so on . When the reaction of one force is converted into another force , the results can be interesting . In fact , one can have a space-drive . But there was bitter resistance to the idea . It was demanded that Burke justify his views in a more reasonable way than by mere demonstration that they worked .  After a time , Burke gave up trying to explain things . And when one and then another duplicate drive worked , the argument ceased . But eminent physicists still had a resentful feeling that Burke was cheating on them somehow .  Then for days nothing happened . One of the three men in the ship always stayed in the control-chair where he could check the ships course against the homing signals from the asteroid . He might have to correct it by the fraction of a hair , or swing ship and put on more drive if the radar should show celestial debris in the spaceships path . Every so many hours the ship had to be swung about so that instead of accelerating she decelerated , or instead of decelerating gained fresh speed . But that was all .  On the fifth day there was the flash of a meteor on the radar . On the seventh day an object which could have been the second or third unmanned Russian probe showed briefly at the very edge of the radar screens . In essence , however , the journey was pure tedium . Burke wearied of making sure that his work was good , though he congratulated himself that nothing did happen to break the monotony . Holmes admitted that he was disappointed . Hed wanted to make the journey because hed sailed in everything but a spaceship . But there was no fun in it . Keller alone seemed comfortably absorbed . He prepared daily lists of instrument-readings to be sent back to Earth . They would be of enormous importance to science-minded people . They were not of interest to Sandy .  Even when she talked to Burke , it was necessarily impersonal . There could be no privacy which was not ostentatious . The two girls used the lower compartment , the three men the upper and larger one . For Sandy to talk privately with Burke , shed have had to go to the small bottom section of the ship . Holmes and Pam faced the same situation . It was uncomfortable . So they developed a perfectly pleasant habit of talking exclusively of things everybody could talk about . It did not bother Keller , who would hardly average a dozen words in twenty-four hours , but Sandy muttered to herself when she and Pam retired for what was a ship-nights rest .  When they went past the orbit of Mars , agitated instructions came out from Earth . The asteroid belts began beyond Mars . Elaborate directions came . The ship was tracked by radar telescopes all around the world , direction-finding on its transmission . Croydon kept track . American radar bowls picked up the ships voice . South American and Hawaiian and Japanese and Siberian radar telescopes determined the ships position every time a set of code symbols reached Earth from the ship . Of course , there were also the beepings and the seventy-nine-minute-spaced identical broadcasts from farther out from the sun .  Somebody got a brilliant idea and authority to try it . An interview for broadcast on Earth was sought with somebody on the ship . It was then a hundred thirty million miles from Earth , and ninety-two million more from the sun . Largely out of boredom Sandy agreed to answer questions . But at the speed of light it required eleven minutes to reach her from Earth , and as long for her reply to be received . It did not make for liveliness , so she spoke curtly for five minutes and stopped . She talked at random about housekeeping in space . Without knowing it , she was praised for her domesticity in many pulpits the following Sunday , and eight hundred ninety-two proposals of marriage piled up in mail addressed to her in care of the United States government . Twelve were in Russian .  But nothing really exciting happened aboard the spaceship . It was Burkes guess that they could go directly through the asteroid belt along the plane of the ecliptic , and not get nearer than ten thousand miles to any bit of shattered stone or metal in orbit out there . He was almost right . There was only one occasion when his optimism came into doubt .  It was on the ninth day out from Earth . Experimentally , the ship coasted on attained momentum , using no drive . There was , then , no substitute for gravity and everyone and everything in the ship was weightless . The power obtainable from the sun as heat had dwindled to one-ninth of that at the Earths distance . But what was received could be stored , and was . Meanwhile the ship plunged onward at very nearly four hundred miles per second . Burke , Keller , and Holmes together labored over a self-contained diving suit which they hoped could be used as a space suit in dire emergency and for brief periods . They wanted to get the feel of using it with internal pressure and weightlessness as conditions . Sandy sat at the transmitter , working at code which by now she heartily loathed . Pam sat in the control-chair , watching the instruments .  There was a buzz . Burke snapped his head around to see the radar screen . A line of light appeared on it . It aimed directly at the center of the screen , which meant that whatever had been picked up was on a collision course with the ship . Burke plunged toward the control-chair to take over . But hed forgotten the condition of no-gravity . He went floating off in mid-air , far wide of the chair .  He barked orders to Pam , who was least qualified of anybody aboard to meet an emergency of this sort . She panicked . She did nothing . Holmes took precious seconds to drag himself to the controls by what hand-holds could be had . The glowing white line on the radar screen lengthened swiftly . It neared the center . It reached the center . Burke and Holmes froze .  There was a curious flashing change in a vision-screen . An image flashed into view . It was a jagged , tortured , irregularly-shaped mass of stone or metal , distorted in its representation by the speed at which it passed the television lens . It was perhaps a hundred yards in diameter . It could never have been seen from Earth . It might circle the sun in its lonely orbit for a hundred million years and never be seen again .  It went away to nothing . It had missed by yards or fathoms , and Burke found himself sweating profusely . Holmes was deathly white . Keller very carefully took a deep breath , swallowed , and went back to his work on the diving-suit-qua-space-suit . Sandy hadnt noticed anything at all . But Pam burst into abrupt , belated tears , and Holmes comforted her clumsily . She was bitterly ashamed that shed done nothing to meet the emergency which came while she was at the control-board , and which was the only emergency theyd encountered since the ships departure from Earth .  After that , they put on the drive and used reserve fuel . It was necessary to check their speed , anyhow . They were very near the source of the beeping signal theyd steered by for so long . The directional receiver pointed to it had long since been turned down to its lowest possible volume , and still the beepings were loud .  On the eleventh day after their take-off , they sighted Asteroid M-387 . They had traveled two hundred seventy million miles at an averaged-out speed of very close to three hundred miles per second . Despite muting , the beepings from the loud-speakers were monstrous noises .  Try a call , Holmes , said Burke . But they ought to know were here .  He felt strange . Hed brought the ship to a stop about four or five miles from M-387 . The asteroid was a mass of dark stuff with white outcroppings at one place and another . The ship seemed to edge itself toward it . The floating mass of stone and metal had no particular shape . It was longer than it was wide , but its form fitted no description . A mountain which had been torn from solidity with its roots of stone attached might look like Schulls Object as it turned slowly against a background of myriads of unblinking stars .  There was no change in the beeping that came from the singular thing . It did rotate , but so slowly that one had to watch for long minutes to be sure of it . There was no outward sign of any reaction to the ships presence . Holmes took the microphone .  Hello! Hello! he said absurdly . We have come from Earth to find out what you want .  No answer . No change in the beeping calls . The asteroid turned with enormous deliberation .  Sandy said suddenly , Look there! A stick! No , its a mast! See , where the patch of white is ?  Burke very , very gingerly drew closer to the monstrous thing which hung in space . It was true . There was a mast of some sort sticking up out of white stone . The direction-indicators pointed to it . The beeping stopped and a broadcast began . It was the standard broadcast Earth heard every seventy-nine minutes .  There was no reply to Holmes call . There was no indication that the ships arrival had been noted . On Earth the ignoring of human broadcasts to M-387 had seemed arrogance , indifference , a superior and menacing contempt for man and all his works; somehow , here the effect was different . This irregular mass was a fragment of something that once had been much greater . It suddenly ceased to seem menacing because it seemed oblivious . It acted blindly , by rote , like some mechanism set to operate in a certain way and unable to act in any other .  It did not seem alive . It had signaled like a robot beacon . Now it felt like one . It was one .  Look , coming around toward us , said Holmes very quietly . Theres something that looks like a tunnel . Its not a crevasse . It was cut .  Burke nodded .  Yes , he said thoughtfully . I think well explore it . But I dont really expect well find any life here . Theres nothing outside to see but a single metal mast . Weve got some signal lights on our hull . If were careful--  No one objected . The appearance of the asteroid was utterly disappointing . Its lifelessness and its obliviousness to their coming and their calls were worse than disappointing . There was nothing to be seen but a metal stick from which signals went out to nowhere .  Burke jockeyed the little ship to the tunnel-mouth . It was fully a hundred feet in diameter . He turned on the ships signal lights . Gently , cautiously , he worked down the very center of the very large bore .  It was perfectly straight . They went in for what seemed an indefinite distance . Presently the signal lights showed that the wall was smoothed . The bore grew smaller still . They went on and on .  Suddenly Keller grunted . He pointed to one of the six television screens which aimed out the length of the tunnel and showed the stars beyond .  Those stars were being blotted out . Something vast moved slowly and deliberately across the shaft they navigated . It closed the opening . Their retreat was blocked . The ship was shut in , in the center of a mountain of stone which floated perpetually in emptiness . Burke checked the ships forward motion , judging their speed by the side walls shown by the ships outside lights .  Very , very slowly , faint illumination appeared outside . In seconds they could see that the light came from long tubes of faint bluish light . The light changed . It grew stronger . It turned green and then yellowish and then became very bright , indeed .  Then nothing more took place . Nothing whatever . The five inside the ship waited more than an hour for some other development , but absolutely nothing happened .     Chapter 6   There was a tiny shock; in a minute , trivial contact of the ship with something outside it . Drifting within the now brightly lighted bore , it had touched the wall . There was no force to the impact .  Keller made an interested noise . When eyes turned to him , he pointed to a dial . A needle on that dial pointed just past the figure 30 . Burke grunted .  The devil! Weve been waiting for things to happen , and they already have! Its our move .  According to that needle , agreed Holmes , somebody has kindly put thirty point seven mercury inches of air-pressure around the ship outside . We can walk out and breathe , now .  If , said Burke , its air . It could be something else . Ill have to check it .  He got out the self-contained diving apparatus that had been brought along to serve as a strictly temporary space suit .  Ill try a cigarette-lighter . Maybe it will burn naturally . Maybe it will go out . It could make an explosion . But I doubt that very much .  Well hope , said Holmes , that the lighter burns .  Burke climbed into the diving suit , which had been designed for amateurs of undersea fishing to use in chilly waters . On Earth it would have been intolerably heavy , for a man moving about out of the ocean . But there was no weight here . If M-387 had a gravitational field at all , which in theory it had to have , it would be on the order of millionths of the pull of Earth .  Keller sat in the control-chair , watching the instruments and the outside television screens which showed the bore now reduced to fifty feet . Somehow the more distant parts of the tunnel looked hazy , as if there were a slight mist in whatever gas had been released in it . Sandy watched Burke pull on the helmet and close the face-plate . She grasped a hand-hold , her knuckles turning white . Pam nestled comfortably in a corner of the ceiling of the control-room . Holmes frowned as Burke went into the air-lock and closed the inner door .  His voice came immediately out of a speaker at the control-desk .  Im breathing canned air from the suit , he said curtly .  There were scrapings . The outer lock-door made noises . There was what seemed to be a horribly long wait . Then they heard Burkes voice again .  Ive tried it , he reported . The lighter burns when its next to the slightly opened door . Im opening wide now .  More noises from the air-lock .  It still burns . Repeat . The lighter burns all right . The tunnel is filled with air . Im going to crack my face-plate and see how it smells .  Silence , while Sandy went white . But a moment later Burke said crisply , It smells all right . Its lifeless and stuffy , but theres nothing in it with an odor . Hold on--I hear something!  A long minute , while the little ship floated eerily almost in contact with the walls about it . It turned slowly . Then there came brisk , brief fluting noises . They were familiar in kind . But this was a short message , of some fifteen or twenty seconds length , no more . It ended , was repeated , ended , was repeated , and went on with an effect of mechanical and parrot-like repetition .  Its good air , reported Burke . Im breathing normally . But it might have been stored for ages . Its stale . Do you hear what I do ?  Yes , said Sandy in a whisper to the control-room . Its a call . Its telling us to do something . Come back inside , Joe!  They heard the outer air-lock door closing and its locking-dogs engaging . The fluting noises ceased to be audible . The inner door swung wide . Burke came into the control-room , his helmet face-plate open . He wriggled out of the diving suit .  Something picked up the fact that wed entered . It closed a door behind us . Then it turned on lights for us . Then it let air into the entrance-lock . Now its telling us to do something .  The ship surged , ever so gently . Keller had turned on an infinitesimal trace of drive . The walls of the bore floated past on the television screens . There was mist in the air outside . It seemed to clear as the ship moved .  Keller made a gratified small sound . They could see the end of the tunnel . There was a platform there . Stairs went to it from the side of the bore . There was a door with rounded corners in the end wall . That wall was metal .  Keller carefully turned the ship until the stairway was in proper position for a landing , if there had been gravitation to make the stairs usable . Very , very gently , he lowered the ship upon the platform .  There was a singular tugging sensation which ceased , came again , ceased , and gradually built up to a perfectly normal feeling of weight . They stood upon the floor of the control-room with every physical sensation theyd felt during one-gravity acceleration on the way out here , and which theyd have felt if the ship were aground on Earth .  Artificial gravity! Whoever made this knew something! Burke said .  Pam swallowed and spoke with an apparent attempt at nonchalance .  Now what do we do ?  We--look for the people , said Sandy in a queer tone .  Theres nobody here , Sandy! Burke said irritably . Cant you see ? There cant be anybody here! Theyd have signaled us what to do if there had been! This is machinery working . We do something and it operates . But then it waits for us to do something else . Its like--like a self-service elevator!  We didnt come here for an elevator ride , said Sandy .  I came to find out whats here , said Burke , and why its signaling to Earth . Holmes , you stay here with the girls and Ill take a look outside .  Id like to mention , said Holmes drily , that we havent a weapon on this ship . When they shot rockets at us back on Earth , we didnt have even a pea-shooter to shoot back with . We havent now . I think the girls are as safe exploring as they are here . And besides , well all feel better if were together .  Im going! said Sandy defiantly .  Burke hesitated , then shrugged . He unlatched the devices which kept both doors to the air-lock from being open at the same time . It was not a completely cautious thing to do , but caution was impractical . The ship was imprisoned . It was incapable of defense . There was simply nothing sensible about precautions that couldnt prevent anything .  Burke threw open the outer lock door . One by one , the five of them climbed down to the platform so plainly designed for a ship of space--a small one--to land upon . Nothing happened . Their surroundings were completely uninformative . This landing-platform might have been built by any race on Earth or anywhere else , provided only that it used stairs .  Here goes , said Burke .  He went to the door with rounded corners . There was something like a handle at one side , about waist-high . He put his hand to it , tugged and twisted , and the door gave . It was not rusty , but it badly needed lubrication . Burke pulled it wide and stared unbelievingly beyond .  Before him there stretched a corridor which was not less than twenty feet high and just as wide . The long , glowing tubes of light that illuminated the ship-tunnel were here , too , fixed in the ceiling . The corridor reached away , straight and unbroken , until its end seemed a mere point in the distance . It looked about a full mile long . There were doorways in both its side walls , and they dwindled in the distance with a monotonous regularity until they , too , were mere vertical specks . One could not speak of the length of this corridor in feet or yards . It was a mile .  It was incredible . It was overwhelming . And it was empty . It shone in the glare of the light tubes which made a river of brilliance overhead . It seemed preposterous that so vast a construction should have no living thing in it . But it was absolutely vacant .  They stared down its length for long seconds . Then Burke seemed to shake himself .  Heres the parlor . Lets walk in , even if theres no welcoming committee .  His voice echoed . It rolled and reverberated and then diminished very slowly to nothing .  Burke strode forward with Sandy close to him . Pam stared blankly , and instinctively moved up to Holmes . Once they were through the door , the sensation was not that of adventure in a remote part of space , but of being in some strange and impossible monument on Earth . The feeling of weight , if not completely normal , was so near it as not to be noticed . They could have been in some previously unknown structure made by men , at home .  This corridor , though , was not built . It was excavated . Some process had been used which did not fracture the stone to be removed . The surface of the rock about them was smooth . In places it glittered . The doorways had been cut out , not constructed . They were of a size which made them seem designed for the use of men . The compartments to which they gave admission were similarly matter-of-fact . They were windowless , of course , but their strangeness lay in the fact that they were empty , as if to insist that all this ingenuity and labor had been abandoned thousands of years before . Yet from somewhere in the asteroid a call still went out urgently , filling the solar system with plaintive fluting sounds , begging whoever heard to come and do something which was direly necessary .  A long , long way down the gallery there were two specks . A quarter-mile from the entrance , they saw that one of the rooms contained a pile of metal ingots , neatly stacked and bound in place by still-glistening wire . At half a mile they came upon the things in the gallery itself . One was plainly a table with a single leg , made of metal . It was unrusted , but showed signs of use . The other was an object with a hollow top . In the hollow there were twisted , shriveled shreds of something unguessable .  If men had built this , said Burke , and again his voice echoed and rolled , that hollow thing would be a stool with a vanished cushion , and the table would be a desk .  Sandy said thoughtfully , If men had built this , thered be signs somewhere marking things . At least thered be some sort of numbers on these doorways!  Burke said nothing . They went on .  The gallery branched . A metal door closed off the divergent branch . Burke tugged at an apparent handle . It did not yield . They continued along the straight , open way .  They came to a larger-than-usual opening in the side wall . Inside it there were rows and rows and rows of metal spheres some ten feet in diameter . There must have been hundreds of them . Beside the door there was a tiny shelf , with a tinier box fastened to it . A long way farther , they came to what had appeared to be the end of this corridor . But it did not end . It slanted upward and turned and they found themselves in the same corridor on a different level , headed back in the direction from which they had come . Their footsteps echoed hollowly in the still-enormous emptiness . There were other closed doors . Burke tried some . Holmes tried others . They did not open . Keller moved raptly , gazing at this and that .  Everything was strange , but not strange enough to be frightening . One could have believed this place the work of men , except that this was beyond the ability of men to make . There must be miles of vacant rooms carved out of solid rock . They came upon some hundreds of yards of doorways , and in every room on which they opened , there were metal frames about the walls . Holmes said suddenly , If men had built this place , those could be bunks .  They came to another place where there was dust , and a group of six huge rooms communicating not only with the corridor but with each other . They found hollow metal things like cook pans . They found a hollow small object which could have been a drinking vessel . It was broken . It was of a size suitable for men .  If men built this , said Holmes again , these could be mess-halls . But I agree with Sandy that there should be signs .  Yet another closed door . It resisted their efforts to open it , just like the others . Keller put out his hand and thoughtfully touched the stone beside it . He looked astonished .  What ? asked Burke . He touched the stone as Keller had . It was bitterly , bitterly cold . The airs warm and the stones cold! Whats this ?  Keller wetted the tip of his finger and rubbed it on the rocky side wall . Instantly , frost appeared . But the air remained warm .  The gallery turned again , and again rose . The third-level passageway was shorter; barely half a mile in length . Here they passed door after door , all open , with each compartment containing a huge and somehow malevolent shape of metal . And beside each doorway there was a little shelf with a small box fastened to it .  These , said Holmes , could be guns , if there were any way for them to shoot anything . Just by the look of them Id say they were weapons .  Burke said abruptly , Keller , the stone being freezing cold while the airs warm means that this place has been heated up lately . Heats been poured into it . Within hours!  Keller considered . Then he shook his head .  Not heat . Warmed air .  Burke went scowling onward . He followed , actually , the only route that was open . Other ways were cut off by doors which refused to open . Sandy , beside him , noted the floor . It was stone like the walls and ceiling . But it was worn . There were slight inequalities in it , beginning a foot or so from the walls . Sandy envisioned thousands of feet moving about these resonant corridors for hundreds or thousands of years in order to wear away the solid stone in this fashion . She felt age about her--incredible age reaching back to time past imagining , while the occupants of this hollow world swarmed about its interior . Doing what ?  Burke considered other things . There were the ten-foot metal spheres , ranged by hundreds in what might be a magazine below . There were the squat and ugly metal monsters which seemed definitely menacing to somebody or something . There were the metal frameworks like bunks . There was no rust , here , which could be accounted for if Keller happened to be right and warmed air had been released lately in corridors which before--for ten thousand years or more--had contained only the vacuum of space . And there were those rooms which could be mess-halls .  These items were subject matter for thought . But if what they hinted at was true , there must be other specialized compartments elsewhere . There must be storerooms for food for those who managed the guns--if they were guns--and the spheres , and lived in the bunk-rooms and ate in the mess-halls . Thered be storerooms for equipment and supplies of all sorts . And again , if Keller were right about the air , there must be enormous pressure-tanks which had held the asteroids atmosphere under high pressure for millennia , only to warm it and release it within the hour so that those who came by ship could use it .  An old phrase occurred to Burke . A mystery wrapped in an enigma . It applied to these discoveries . Plainly the release of air had been done without the command of any living creature . There could be none here! As plainly , the signals from space had been begun without the interposition of life . The transmitter which still senselessly flung its message to Earth was a robot . The operation of the ship-lock , the warming of air , the lighting of the ship-lock and the corridors--all had been accomplished by machinery , obeying orders given to the transmitter first by some unguessable stimulus .  But why ? Other mysteries aside , there had plainly been meticulous preparation for the welcoming of a ship from space . No , not welcoming . Acceptance of a ship from space . Somebody had been expected to respond to those plaintive fluting noises which went wailing through the solar system . Who were those waited-for visitors expected to be ? What were they expected to do ? For that matter , what was the purpose of the asteroid itself ? What had it been built for ? At some time or another it must have contained thousands of inhabitants . What were they here for ? What became of them ? And when the asteroid was left--abandoned--what conceivable situation was to trigger the transmitter to send out urgent calls , and then a directional guiding-signal the instant the call was answered ? When Burkes ship came , the asteroid accepted it without question and carried out mechanical operations to make it possible for that ships crew to roam at will through it . What activated this mechanism of so many eons ago ?  The five newly-arrived humans , three men and two girls , trudged along the echoing gallery cut out of the asteroids heart . Murmurous sounds accompanied them . Once they came to a place where a whispering-gallery effect existed . They heard their footsteps repeated loudly as if the asteroid inhabitants were approaching invisibly , but no one came .  I dont like this! Pam said uneasily .  Then her own voice mocked her , and she realized what it was , and giggled nervously . That also was repeated , and sounded like something which seemed to sneer at them . It was unpleasant .  They came to the end of the gallery . There was a stair leading upward . There was nowhere else to go , so Burke started up , Sandy close behind him , and Holmes and Pam behind them . Keller brought up the rear . They climbed , and small noises began to be audible .  They were fluting sounds . They grew louder as the party from Earth went up and up . They reached a landing , and here also there was a metal door with rounded corners . Through it and from beyond it came the piping notes that Burke had heard in his dream some hundreds of times and that lately had come to Earth from emptiness . The sounds seemed to pause and to begin again , and once more to pause . It was not possible to tell whether they came from one source , speaking pathetically , or from two sources in conversation .  Sandy went utterly white and her eyes fixed upon Burke . He was nearly as pale , himself . He stopped . Here and now there was no trace of ribbony-leaved trees or the smell of green things , but only air which was stuffy and lifeless as if it had been confined for centuries . And there was no sunset sky with two moons in it , but only carved and seamless stone . Yet there were the familiar fluting sounds . . . .  Burke put his hand to the curiously-shaped handle of the door . It yielded . The door opened inward . Burke went in , his throat absurdly dry . Sandy followed him .  And again there was disappointment . Because there was no living creature here . The room was perhaps thirty feet long and as wide . There were many vision-screens in it , and some of them showed the stars outside with a precision of detail no earthly television could provide . The sun glowed as a small disk a third of its proper diameter . It was dimmer , too . The Milky Way showed clearly . And there were very many screens which showed utterly clear views of the surface of the asteroid , all broken , chaotic , riven rock and massy , unoxydized metal .  But there was no life . There were not even symbols of life . There were only machines . They noticed a large transparent disk some ten feet across . Specks of light glowed within its substance . Off at one side an angular metal arm held a small object very close to the disks surface , a third of the way from its edge . It did not touch the disk , but under it and in the disk there was a little group of bright-red specks which quivered and wavered . They were placed in a strict mathematical arrangement which very , very slowly changed so that it would be hours before it had completed a rotation and had exactly the same appearance again .  The flutings came from a tall metal cone on the floor . Another machine nearby held a round plate out toward the cone . Theres nobody here , said Sandy in a strange voice . Whatll we do now , Joe ?  This must be the transmitter , he murmured . The sound-record for the broadcasts must be in here , somehow . Its possible that this plate is a sort of microphone--  Keller , beaming , pointed to a round spot which quivered with an eerie luminescence . It glowed more brightly and dimmed according to the flutings . Burke said The devil! and the round spot flickered up very brightly for an instant .  Yes , said Burke . Its a mike . Its quite likely-- the round spot flared up and dimmed with the modulations of his voice--its quite likely that what I say goes into the broadcast to Earth .  The cone ceased to emit fluting noises . Burke said very steadily--and the spot flickered violently with the sounds--I think I am transmitting to Earth . If so , this is Joe Burke . I announce the arrival of my ship at Asteroid M-387 . The asteroid has been hollowed out and fitted with an air-lock which admitted our ship . It is a--a--  He hesitated , and Holmes said curtly , Its a fortress .  Yes , said Burke heavily . Its a fortress . There are weapons we havent had time to examine . There are barracks for a garrison of thousands . But there is no one here . It has been deserted , but not abandoned , because the transmitter was set up to send out a call when some occasion arose . It seems to have arisen . There is a big plate here which may be a star map , with a scale on which light-years may be represented by inches . I dont know . There are certain bright-red specks on it . They are moving . There is a machine to watch those specks . Apparently it actuated the transmitter to make it call to all the solar system .  Keller suddenly put his finger to his lips . Burke nodded and said curtly , Ill report further .  Keller flipped over an odd switch with something of a flourish--after which he looked embarrassed . The transmitter went dead .  Hes right , said Holmes . Back home they know were here , I suspect , and youve told enough to give them fits . I think wed better be careful what we say in the clear .  Burke nodded again . Therell be calls from Earth shortly and we can decide whether or not to use code then . Keller , can you trace the leads to this transmitter and find the receiver that picked up that West Virginia beam-signal and changed the first broadcast to the second ? It should be as sensitive as this transmitter is powerful .  Keller nodded confidently .  Itll take thirty-some minutes for that report of mine to reach Earth and an answer to get back , observed Burke , if everything works perfectly and the proper side of Earth is turned this way . I think we can be sure theres nobody but us in the fortress .  His sensations were peculiar . It was exciting to have found a fortress in space , of course . It was the sort of thing that might have satisfied a really dedicated scientist completely . Burke realized the importance of the discovery , but it was an impersonal accomplishment . It did not mean , to Burke , that hed carried out the purpose behind his coming here . This fortress was linked to a dream about a world with two moons in its sky and someone or something running breathlessly behind unearthly swaying foliage . But this place was not the place of that dream , nor did it fulfill it . Mystery remained , and frustration , and Burke was left in the state of mind of a savage who has found a treasure which means much to civilized men , but doesnt make him any happier because he doesnt want what civilized men can give him .  He grimaced and spoke without elation .  Lets go back to the ship and get a code message ready for Earth .  He led the way out of this room of many motionless but operating machines . The incredibly perfect vision-screen images still portrayed the cosmos outside with all the stars and the sun itself moving slowly across their plates . They saw sunshine and starlight shining on the broken , chaotic outer surface of the asteroid . Wavering , curiously writhing red specks on the ten-foot disk continued their crawling motion . Keller fairly glowed with enthusiasm as he began to investigate this apparatus .  They all went back to the ship , except for Keller . They retraced their way along the long and brilliantly lighted galleries . They descended ramps and went along more brilliantly lighted corridors . Then they came to the branch which had been blocked off by a door that would not open . It was open now . They could see along the new section for a long , long way . They passed places where other doors had been closed , but now were open . What they could see inside them was almost exclusively a repetition of what they saw outside of them . They passed the place where hundreds of ten-foot metal spheres waited for an unknown use . They passed the table with a single leg , and the compartment with many metal ingots stored in it .  Finally , they came to the door with rounded corners , went through it , and there was their ship with its air-lock doors open , waiting in the brightly lighted tunnel .  They went in , and the feeling was of complete anticlimax . They knew , of course , that they had made a discovery beside which all archæological discoveries on Earth were trivial . They had come upon operating machines which must be old beyond imagining , unrusted because preserved in emptiness , and infinitely superior to anything that men had ever made . They had come upon a mystery to tantalize every brain on Earth . The consequences of their coming to this place would re-make all of Earths future . But they were singularly unelated .  Ill make up a sort of report , said Burke heavily , of what we saw as we arrived , and our landing , and that sort of thing . Well get it in code and ready for transmission . We can use the asteroids transmitter .  Holmes scowled at the floor of the little ship .  Youll make a report , too , said Burke . You realized that this is a fortress . There cant be any doubt . It was built and put here to fight something . It wasnt built for fun . But I wonder who it was meant to do battle with , and why it was left by its garrison , and why they set up a transmitter to broadcast when something happened! Maybe it was to call the garrison back if they were ever needed . But thousands of years--You make a report on that!  Holmes nodded .  You might add , said Pam , shivering a little , that its a terribly creepy place .  What I dont understand , said Sandy , is why nothings labelled . Nothings marked . Whoever built it must have known how to write , in some fashion . A civilized race has to have written records to stay civilized! But I havent seen a symbol or a pointer or even a color used to give information .  She got out the papers on which she would code the reports as Burke and Holmes turned them over for transmission . She began to write out , carefully , the elaborate key to the coding . Almost reluctantly , Pam prepared to do the same with Holmes narrative of what hed seen .  But if enthusiasm was tempered in the ship , there was no such reserve in the United States . Burkes voice had cut into one of the space broadcasts which arrived every seventy-nine minutes . There had been the usual cryptic , plaintive piping noises , repeating for the thousandth time their meaningless message . Then a human voice said almost inaudibly ,  . . . ll we do now , Joe ? It was heard over an entire hemisphere , where satellite-tracking stations and radar telescopes listened to and recorded every broadcast from space .  It was a stupendous happening . Then Burkes voice came through the flutings . This must be the transmitter . The sound-record for the broadcasts must be in here , somehow . Its quite possible that this plate is a sort of microphone . . . . A few seconds later he was heard to say , The devil! And later still he addressed himself directly to his listeners on Earth .  Hed spoken the words eighteen and a fraction minutes before they arrived , though they traveled at the speed of light . Broadcast and ecstatically reported in the United States , they touched off a popular reaction as widespread as that triggered by the beginning of the signals themselves . Broadcasters abandoned all other subject matter . Announcers with lovely diction stated the facts and then expanded them into gibbering nonsense . Man had reached M-387 . Man had spoken to Earth across two hundred seventy million miles of emptiness . Man had taken possession of a fortress in space . Man now had an outpost , a stepping-stone toward the stars . Man had achieved . . . . Man had risen . . . . Man now took the first step toward his manifest destiny , which was to occupy and possess all the thousands of thousands of planets all the way to the galaxys rim .  But this was in the United States . Elsewhere , rejoicing was much less , especially after a prominent American politician was reported to have said that Americas leadership of Earth was not likely ever to be challenged again . A number of the smaller nations immediately protested in the United Nations . That august body was forced to put upon its agenda a full-scale discussion of U .S . space developments . Middle European nations charged that the purpose of America was to monopolize not only the practical means of traveling to other members of the solar system , but all natural and technical resources obtained by such journeyings . With a singular unanimity , the nations at the edge of the Russian bloc demanded that there should be equality of information on Earth . No nation should hold back scientific information . In fact , there was bitter denunciation of the use of code by the humans now on M-387 . It was demanded that they answer in the clear all scientific inquiries made by any government--in the clear so everybody could eavesdrop .  In effect , the United States rejoiced in and boasted of the achievements of some of its citizens who , after escaping attack by American guided missiles , had found a stepping-stone toward the stars . But the rest of the world jealously demanded that the United States reap no benefit from the fact . International tension , in fact , rose to a new high .  And Burke and the others laboriously gathered this bit of information and discovered the lack of that . They found incredible devices whose purpose or workings they could not understand . They found every possible evidence of a civilization beside which that of Earth was intolerably backward . But the civilization had abandoned the asteroid .  By the second day the mass of indigestible information had become alarming . They could marvel , but they could not understand . And not to understand was intolerable . They could comprehend that there was a device with red sparks in it which had made another device send a fluting , plaintive call to all the solar system . Nothing else was understandable . The purpose of the call remained a mystery .  But the communicators hummed with messages from Earth . It seemed that every radar telescope upon the planet had been furnished with a transmitter and that every one bombarded the asteroid with a tight beam carrying arguments , offers , expostulations and threats .  This ought to be funny , said Burke dourly . But it isnt . All we know is that weve found a fortress which was built to defend a civilization about which we know nothing except that it isnt in the solar system . We know an alarm went off , to call the fortress garrison back to duty , but the garrison didnt come . We did . Weve some evidence that a fighting fleet or something similar is headed this way and that it intends to smash this fortress and may include Earth . Youd think that that sort of news would calm them down , on Earth!  The microwave receiver was so jammed with messages that there was no communication at all . None could be understood when all arrived at once . Burke had to send a message to Earth in code , specifying a new and secret wavelength , before it became possible to have a two-way contact with Earth . But the messages continued to come out , every one clamoring for something else of benefit to itself alone .     Chapter 7   In the beginning there was nothing at all , and then things were created , and the wonder of created things was very great . When men became , they marveled at the richness and the beauty about them , and their lives were filled with astonishment at the myriads of things in the air and on the earth and in the sea . For many centuries they were busy taking note of all the created things that were . They forgot that there was such a condition as emptiness .  But there were six people in a certain solar system who really knew what emptiness amounted to . Five of them were in a fortress which was an asteroid and a mystery . One was in a small , crude object which floated steadily out from Earth . This ones name was Nikolai . The rest of it does not matter . He had been born in a small village in the Urals , and as a little boy he played games with mud and reeds and sticks and dogs and other little boys . As a growing youth he dutifully stuffed his head with things out of books , and some seemed to him rational and marvelous , and some did not make much sense but were believed by everybody . And who was he to go against the wise comrades who ran the government and protected the people from wars and famines and the schemes of villainous capitalists ?  As a young man he was considered promising . If he had been interested in such matters , he might have had a moderately successful career in politics , as politics was practised in his nation . But he liked things . Real things .  When he was a student in the university he kept a canary in his lodgings . He loved it very much . There was a girl , too , about whom he dreamed splendidly . But there was a need for school teachers in Bessarabia , and she went there to teach . She wept when she left him . After that Nikolai studied with something of desperation , trying to forget her because he could not have her .  He thought of such past events as he drifted outward from Earth . He was the passenger , he was the crew of the manned space-probe his government had prepared to go out and investigate strange signals coming from emptiness . He was a volunteer , of course . It was a great honor to be accepted , and for a while hed almost forgotten the girl who was teaching school in Bessarabia . But that was a long time ago , now . At first hed liked to remember the take-off , when brisk , matter-of-fact men tucked him in his acceleration-chair and left him , and he lay staring upward in dead silence--save for the ticking of an insanely emotionless clock--until there was a roar to end all roars and a shock to crush anything made of flesh and bones , and then a terrible , horrible feeling of weight that kept on and on until he lost consciousness .  He could remember all this , if he chose . He had a distinct recollection of coming back to life , and of struggling to send off the signal which would say that he had survived the take-off . There were telemetering devices which reported what information was desired about the bands and belts of deadly radiation which surrounded the planet Earth . But Nikolai reported by voice , because that was evidence that he had passed through those murderous places unharmed . And his probe went on and on outward , away from the Earth and the sun .  He received messages from Earth . Tinny voices assured him that his launching had gone well . His nation was proud of him . Enormous rewards awaited him on his return . Meanwhile--The tinny voices instructed him in what he was to say for them to record and broadcast to all the world in his honor .  He said it , with the Earth a small crescent-shaped bit of brightness behind him . He drifted on . The crescent which was Earth grew smaller and smaller as days went by . He took due care of the instruments of his space-vehicle . He made sure that the air apparatus behaved properly . He disposed of wastes . From time to time he reported , by voice , information which automatic devices had long since given in greater detail and with superior accuracy .  And he thought more and more about the girl--teaching school in Bessarabia--and his canary , which had died . Days went by . He was informed that it was time for him to make contact with a drone fuel-rocket sent on before him . He watched the instruments which would point out where it was .  He found it , and with small auxiliary rockets he made careful tiny blastings which guided his vehicle to contact with it . The complex machinery for refueling took effect . Presently he cast off the emptied drone , aimed very , very carefully and blasted outward once more . The shock was worse than that on Earth , and he knew nothing for a long , long time . He was horribly weak when he regained consciousness . He mentioned it in his reports . There was no comment on the fact in the replies he received from Earth .  He continued to float away from the sun . It became impossible to pick out Earth among the stars . The sun was smaller than he remembered . There was nothing to be seen anywhere but stars and more stars and the dwindling disk of the sun that used to rise and set but now remained stationary , shrinking .  So Nikolai came to know emptiness . There were points of light which were stars . They were illimitable distances away . In between was emptiness . He had no sensation of movement . Save that as days went by the sun grew smaller , there was no change in anything . All was emptiness . If his vehicle floated like this for ten thousand times ten thousand years , the stars would appear no nearer . If he got out and ran upon nothingness to get back to where he could see Earth again , he would have to run for centuries , and generations would die and nations fall before he caught the least glimmer of that thin crescent which was his home .  If he shouted , no man would ever hear , because emptiness does not carry sound . If he died , there was no earth into which his body could be lowered . If he lived , there was nowhere he could stand upright and breathe clean air and feel solidity beneath his feet . He had a destination , to be sure , but he did not really believe that he would ever reach it , nor did he imagine he would ever return . Now he dismissed it from his thoughts .  He found that he was feverish , and he mentioned it when the tinny voices talked urgently to him . He guessed , without emotion , that he had not passed through the deadly radiation-belts around Earth unburned . He had been assured that he would pass through them so swiftly that they would be quite harmless . Now he knew that this was a mistake . His body obeyed him only sluggishly . He was dying of deep-seated radiation burns . But he felt nothing .  Voices waked him to insist that he make contact with another fuel-drone . He exhausted himself as he dutifully obeyed commands . He was clumsy . He was feeble . But he managed a second refueling . And even as he performed the highly technical operation with seemingly detached and reluctant hands , he thought of a schoolteacher in Bessarabia .  Before he fired the new fuel which would send him onward at what would be more than escape velocity , he almost humorously--yet quite humorlessly--reviewed his life . He considered that he might have no later opportunity to do so . There were three things he had done which no man had done before him . He had loved a certain small canary , and he remembered it distinctly . He had loved a certain girl , and in his weakened and dying state he could see her much more clearly than the grubby interior of the space-probe . And the third thing--  He had to cast about in his mind to remember what it was . His hand poised upon the rocket-firing key , he debated . Ah , yes! The third thing was that he had learned what emptiness was .  He pressed the firing-key . And the space-probe spouted flames and went on . Before the fuel was exhausted it had reached a velocity so great that it would go on forever through interstellar space . It would never fall back toward the sun , not even after thousands of years .         *       *       *       *       *  The knowledge of emptiness possessed by the five in the asteroid was different . A totally empty room is intimidating . A vacant house is depressing . The two-mile-long asteroid , honeycombed with tunnels and corridors and galleries and rooms , was like a deserted city . Those who had left it had carefully stripped it of personal possessions , but theyd left weapons behind , ready to be manned and used . Theyd left a warning device to call them . The recall device was proof that the danger had not been destroyed and might return . And the plaintive call through all the solar system proved that it was returning .  There was irony in the fact that Earth had panicked when it seemed that intelligent non-human beings signaled from space , and that shrill disputes for advantage began instantly Burke reported no living monsters at the signals source . The fortress and its call meant more than the mere existence of aliens . It was proof that there were entities of space who needed to be fought . It proved the existence of fighting ships of space; of deadly war in emptiness; of creatures who crossed the void between star systems to conquer and to murder and destroy .  And such creatures were coming .  Burke ground his teeth . Earth had fusion bombs and rockets which could carry them for pitifully short distances on the cosmic scale . This fortress was incomparably more powerful than all of Earths armament put together . A fleet which dared to attack it must feel itself stronger still . What could Earth do against a fleet which dared attack this asteroid ?  And what could he and Holmes and Keller do against such a fleet , even with the fortress , when they did not yet understand a single one of its weapons ?  Burke worked himself to exhaustion , trying to unravel even the simplest principles of the fortress armament . There were globes which were , obviously , the long-range weapons of the garrison . They were stored in a launching-tube at the far back of the compartment . But Keller could not unravel the method of their control . There was no written matter in the fortress . None . A totally unknown language and an unfamiliar alphabet would prevent written matter from being useful , ordinarily , but in technical descriptions there are bound to be diagrams . Burke felt desperately that in even the most meaningless of scripts there would be diagrams which could be puzzled out . But there was nothing . The builders of the fortress could have been illiterate , for all the signs of writing that theyd left .  Keller continued to labor valiantly . But there was no clue to the operation of anything but the transmitter . That was understandable because one knew where the message went in , and where it came out for broadcast . With the apparatus before one , one could deduce how it operated . But no one could guess how weapons were controlled when he hadnt the least idea of what they did .  On the third night in the asteroid--the third night by ship-time , since there was neither day nor night in the great empty corridors of the fortress--Burke dreamed his dream again . It was perfectly familiar , from the trees with their trailing leaves , to the markings on the larger moon . He felt the anguished anxiety hed so often known before . He grasped the hand-weapon and knew that he was ready to fight anything imaginable for the person he feared for . He heard small fluting sounds behind him , and then he knew that someone ran breathlessly behind the swaying foliage just ahead . He felt such relief and exultation that his heart seemed about to burst . He gave a great shout and bounded to meet her--  He waked in the small ship in the entrance tunnel . All was silent . All was still . The lights in the control-compartment of the ship were turned to dim . There was no sound anywhere . The opened air-lock doors , both inner and outer , let in a fan-shaped streak of brightness which lay on the floor .  Burke lay quiet , still wrought up by the vivid emotions of the dream .  He heard a stirring in the compartment below , occupied by Sandy and Pam . Someone came very quietly up the ladder-like stairway . Burke blinked in the semi-darkness . He saw that it was Sandy . She crossed the compartment to the air-lock . Very quietly , she closed the outer door and then the inner . She fastened them .  Burke said , sitting up , Whyd you do that , Sandy ?  She started violently , and turned .  Pam cant sleep , she said in a low tone . She says the fortress is creepy . She feels that theres something hiding in it , something deadly and frightening . When you leave the air-lock open , shes afraid . So I closed it .  Holmes and Keller are out , said Burke . Kellers trying to trace down power-leads from the instrument-room to whatever power-source warms and lights everything . We cant lock him out .  Sandy obediently opened the air-lock doors again . She turned toward the ladder leading downward .  Sandy , said Burke unhappily , I know Im acting like a fool .  Youre doing all right , said Sandy . She paused at the top of the ladder . Finding this-- she waved her hand about her--ought to put your name in the history books . Of course youll be much disliked by people who intended to invent space travel themselves . But youre doing all right .  Im not thinking of that , said Burke . Im thinking of you . I was going to ask you to marry me . I didnt . If we live through this , will you ?  Sandy regarded him carefully in the dim light of the ships interior , most of which came through the air-lock doors .  There are some conditions , she said evenly . I wont play second fiddle to an imaginary somebody behind a veil of dreamed-of leaves . I dont want to make conditions , Joe . But I couldnt stand your feeling that maybe in marrying me youd give up your chance of finding her--whatever or whoever she is .  But I wouldnt feel that way! protested Burke .  Id believe you did , said Sandy . And it would amount to the same thing . I think I made a mistake in coming along in the ship , Joe . If I werent along you might have missed me . You might even-- she grimaced--you might even have dreamed about me . But here I am . And I cant compete with somebody in a dream . I wont even try . I--I cant imagine marrying anybody else , but if I do get married I want to be the only girl my guy dreams about!  She turned again to the ladder . Then said abruptly , You didnt ask why Pam feels creepy , or where . Theres a place up on the second gallery where theres a door thats still locked . Pam gets the shivers when she goes by it . I dont . The whole place is creepy , to me .  She went down the ladder . Minutes later Holmes and Keller arrived .  Holmes said curtly , The machinery in the transmitter-room reached a change-point just now . Those red dots in that plastic plate apparently started the transmitter in the first place . When its calls were answered it changed the broadcast , adding a directional signal . Just before we started out from Earth the red sparks passed another place and changed the broadcast again . Now theyve passed a third place . We were there when the machinery shifted all around on a signal from that thing which hovers close to the red sparks and watches them . The transmitter probably blasted out at four or five times its original volume . There must have been a hundred thousand kilowatts in it , at least . It looks serious . Whatever those red sparks represent must be close .  Keller nodded in agreement , frowning , then he and Holmes wearily prepared to turn in . But Burke was upset . He knew he wouldnt be able to sleep .  Pam gets the creeps when she passes a certain locked door up on the second gallery . I never noticed it , but Im going to get that door open . We got to look into every compartment of this thing! Theres bound to be something informative somewhere! Close the air-lock behind me so Pam can sleep .  He went out . Behind him , Holmes looked at Keller .  Funny! he said drily . Were all scared . I feel uneasy all the time , without knowing why . But if hes as scared as I am , why doesnt he worry about going places alone ?  The same question occurred to Burke . The atmosphere of the brightly lighted halls was ominous and secretive . A man alone in a vast empty building would feel queer even in broad daylight with sunshine and other humans to be seen out of any window . But in this monstrous complex of tunnels and rooms carved out of solid stone , with uncountable millions of miles of pure emptiness without , the feeling of loneliness was incredible . He reflected wryly that a dog would be a comforting companion to have on such a journey as his .  He went down the long gallery with doors on either side . Past the room with the piled metal ingots . Past the door through which one saw hundreds of ten-foot metal globes . Up a ramp . Past the rooms where something like bunks must once have stood against the walls . A long way along this corridor . Emptiness , emptiness , emptiness . Innumerable echoings of his footsteps on the stone .  Three times he stopped at doors that had swung shut , but none was fully closed . All yielded readily . Then he came to the door Sandy had spoken about . He worked the handle repeatedly . It was firmly shut . He kicked the door and with a loud click it swung open .  There were lights inside this room , as everywhere else they had explored . But it was nearly impossible to see any distance . This was an extremely long room , and it contained racks of metal which reached from floor to ceiling . Each rack was a series of shallow metal troughs , and in each trough there was a row of crumbly black metal cubes , very systematically arranged . Each side was about three inches square , and they were dull black , not glistening at all . They filled the racks completely . There were narrow aisles between the rows of racks , through which Burke could make his way easily enough , but which a more portly man might have found inconvenient .  He stared at a trough , and was stunned . He picked up one of the cubes , and immediately recognized the object in his hand . It was a dull-black , smudgy cube exactly like the one his uncle had brought back from the Cro-Magnon cave in France . He knew that if he dropped this object--found two hundred seventy million miles from the other one--it would split into thousands of tissue-thin , shiny pieces .  He did drop it . Deliberately . And it shattered into layers which lay like films of mica on the floor .  For no clearly understandable reason , Burke found that his flesh crawled . He had to force himself to stay in this room with so many thousands of the enigmatic cubes . There had been a cube of this kind on Earth . The one hed known as a child had belonged to a Cro-Magnon tribesman ten thousand , twenty thousand , how many years ago ? And it could only have come from this asteroid . Which meant--  Presently he made his way back to the spaceship . He carried one of the cubes , rather gingerly . He meant to show it to Sandy . But the implications were startling .  Members of the garrison of this fortress , thousands of years gone by , had visited Earth . One of them , doubtless , had carried that other cube . Why ? When the garrison abandoned the asteroid they left these cubes behind . They left behind intricate machinery to call them back . They left squat machines and ten-foot globes which must be weapons . They left nothing that would be useful in the place to which they had removed . But theyd left these cubes , hundreds of thousands of them .  The cube , then , could be anything . It could be impersonal , like equipment for the fortress that would be useless elsewhere . The fortress equipment was designed to deal out death . Were the cubes ? No . Burke had owned one without damage . When that cube split into glistening , tissue-thin plates , no one was injured . To be sure , there was his dream . But the cube wasnt a weapon . Whatever else it might be , it was not dangerous .  He went into the spaceship and for no reason whatever firmly locked both air-lock doors . Holmes and Keller were asleep . There was no sound from the lower compartment occupied by Sandy and Pam .  Burke put the black object on the control-desk . The single cube on Earth had been meaningless . The museum which joyfully accepted Cro-Magnon artifacts from his uncle had dismissed it as of no importance . It was fit only to be given to an eleven-year-old boy . But a roomful of such cubes couldnt be without meaning!  He dismissed this newest mystery with an almost violent effort of his will . It was a mystery . Yet there was no intention to have the fortress seem a mystery to whoever answered its call to space . He could guess that the signals were notification of some emergency which needed to be met . The automatic apparatus of the ship-lock was set to aid those who came in response to the call . But everything presupposed that those who came would know why they came .  Burke didnt . The thing must be simple , an explanation not yet thought of . But there was nowhere to start to think about it! His recurrent dream ? No . That was as mysterious as the rest .  Burke was very , very lonely and depressed . He could look for no help in solving the mystery . Earth was now past the point of conjunction with M-387 , and moved nearly a million miles a day along its orbit , with nearly half of them away from the fortress . At the most hopeful estimate , it would be three months or later before an emergency space fleet of replicas of his own ship could lift off from Earth for here .  And Burke was reasonably sure that the red sparks would have reached the center of the disk in much less time than that . If it were in some fashion like a radar , making a map of the surroundings of the asteroid , the observers place would be in the middle . In that event , whatever the red sparks represented would reach the fortress before more ships came out from Earth .  He sat with his chin on his chest , wearily debating the impossibility of meeting a situation in which all humanity might well be involved . His achievement of space travel provided no sense of triumph , and the discovery of the abandoned fortress produced no elation . Not when a desperate emergency requiring a non-existent garrison to report for duty was so probable . Burke sat in the control-chair and could find no encouragement in any of his thoughts . . . .         *       *       *       *       *  He heard a trumpet-call and was on his feet , buckling familiar equipment about him . There were other figures all around in this bunkroom , similarly equipping themselves . Some grumbled . There was a rush for the doorway and he found himself one of a line of trotting figures which swung sharply out the door and went swiftly down one of the high-ceilinged corridors . The faces he saw were hardbitten and resentful . They moved , but out of habit , not choice . There were other lines of men in motion . Some rushed in the same direction . Others ran stolidly into branching corridors and were lost to sight . Up a ramp , with the pounding of innumerable feet filling his ears with echoed sound . Suddenly there were fewer men before him . Some had darted through a doorway to the right . More vanished . He was at the head of his line . He turned into the doorway next beyond , and saw a squat and menacing object there . He swung up its side and seated himself . He dropped a helmet over his head and saw empty space with millions of unwinking stars beyond it . He waited . He was not Burke . He was someone else who happened to be the pointer , the aimer , of the weapon he sat astride . This might be a drill , but it could be action .  A voice spoke inside his helmet . The words were utterly strange , but he understood them . He tested the give of this lever and the response of that . He spoke crisply , militarily , in words that somehow meant this--a word missing--was ready for action at its highest rate of fire .  Again he waited , his eyes examining the emptiness he saw from within his helmet . A star winked . He snatched at a lever and centered it , snapping sharp , bitten-off words . The voice in his helmet said , Flam! He jerked the firing-lever and all space was blotted out for seconds by flaming light . Then the light faded and far , far away among the stars something burned horribly , spouting fire . It blew up .  Yet again he waited . He doggedly watched the stars , because the Enemy had some way to prevent detection by regular instruments , and only the barest flicker of one among myriad light-specks could reveal the presence of an Enemy craft .  A long time later the voice in his helmet spoke again , and he relaxed , and lifted the helmet . He nodded to the others of the crew of this weapon . Then a trumpet blew again , and he dismounted leisurely from the saddle of the ungainly thing hed fired , and he and his companions waited while long lines of men filed stolidly past the doorway . They were on the way back to the bunk-rooms . They did not look well-fed . His turn came . His crew filed out into the corridor , now filled with men moving in a bored but disciplined fashion . He heard somebody say that it was an Enemy scout , trying some new device to get close to the fortress . Eight weapons had fired on it at the same instant , his among them . Whatever the new device was , the Enemy had found it didnt work . But he knew that it neednt have been a real Enemy , but just a drill . Nobody knew when supposed action was real . There was much suspicion that there was no real action . There was always the possibility of real action , though . Of course . The Enemy had been the Enemy for thousands of years . A century or ten or a hundred of quietude would not mean the Enemy had given up . . . .         *       *       *       *       *  Then Burke found himself staring at the quietly glowing monitor-lights of his own ships control-board . He was himself again . He remembered opening his eyes . Hed dozed , and hed dreamed , and now he was awake . And he knew with absolute certainty that what hed dreamed came from the black cube hed brought back from the previously locked-up room . But there was a difference between this dream and the one hed had for so many years . He could not name the difference , but he knew it . This was not an emotion-packed , illusory experience which would haunt him forever . This was an experience like the most vivid of books . It was something he would remember , but he would need to think about it if he were to remember it fully .  He sat stiffly still , going over and over this new memory , until he heard someone moving about in the compartment below .  Sandy ?  Yes , said Sandy downstairs . What is it ?  I opened the door that bothered Pam , said Burke . Suddenly the implications of what had just occurred began to hit him . This was the clue hed needed . Now he knew--many things . I found out what the fortress is for . I suspect I know what the signals were intended to do .  Silence for a moment . Then Sandys voice . Im coming right up .  In minutes she ascended the stairs .  What is it , Joe ?  He waved his hand , with some grimness , at the small black object on the control-desk .  I found this and some thousands of others behind that creepy door . I suspect that it accounts for the absence of signs and symbols . It contains information . I got it . You get it by dozing near one of these things . I did . I dreamed .  Sandy looked at him anxiously .  No , he told her . No twin moons or waving foliage . I dreamed I was a member of the garrison . I went through a training drill . I know how to operate those big machines on the second level of the corridor , now . Theyre weapons . I know how to use them .  Sandys uneasiness visibly increased .  These black cubes are--lesson-givers . Theyre subliminal instructors . Pam is more sensitive to such stuff than the rest of us . It didnt affect me until I dozed . Then I found myself instructed by going through an experience in the form of a dream . These cubes contain records of experiences . You have those experiences . You dream them . You learn .  Then he said abruptly , I understand my recurrent dream now , I think . When I was eleven years old I had a cube like this . Dont ask me how it got into a Cro-Magnon cave! But I had it . One day it dropped and split into a million leaves of shiny stuff . One got away under my bed , close up under my pillow . When I slept I dreamed about a place with two moons and strange trees and--all the rest .  Sandy said , groping , Do you mean it was magnetized in some fashion , and when you slept you were affected by it so you dreamed something--predetermined ?  Exactly , said Burke grimly . The predetermined thing in this particular cube is the way to operate those machines Holmes said were weapons . Then he said more grimly , I think were going to have to accept the idea that this cube is an instruction device to teach the garrison without their having to learn to read or write or think . Theyd have only to dream .  Sandy looked from him to the small black cube .  Then we can find out--  Ive found it out , said Burke . I guessed before , but now I know . There is an Enemy this fortress was built to fight . There is a war thats lasted for thousands of years . The Enemy has spaceships and strange weapons and is absolutely implacable . It has to be found . And the signals from space were calls to the garrison of this fortress to come back and fight it . But there isnt any garrison any more . We answered instead . The Enemy comes from hundreds or thousands of light-years away , and he tries desperately to smash the defenses of this fortress and others , and when he succeeds there will be massacre and atrocity and death to celebrate his victory . Hes on the way now . And when he comes-- Burkes voice grew harsh . When he comes he wont stop with trying to smash this place . The people of Earth are the Enemys enemies , too . Because the garrison was a garrison of men!     Chapter 8   I dont believe it , said Holmes flatly .  Burke shrugged . He found that he was tense all over , so he took some pains to appear wholly calm .  It isnt reasonable! insisted Holmes . It doesnt make sense!  The question , observed Burke , isnt whether it makes sense , but whether its fact . According to the last word from Earth , theyre still insisting that the ships drive is against all reason . But were here . And speaking of reason , would the average person look at this place and say blandly , Ah , yes! A fortress in space . To be sure! Would they ? Is this place reasonable ?  Holmes grinned .  Ill go along with you there , he agreed . It isnt . But you say its garrison was men . Look here! Have you seen a place before where men lived without writings in its public places ? They tell me the ancient Egyptians wrote their names on the Sphinx and the Pyramids . Nowadays theyre scrawled in phone booths and on benches . Its the instinct of men to autograph their surroundings . But theres not a line of written matter in this place! Thats not like men!  Again , said Burke , the question isnt of normality , but of fact .  Then Ill try it , said Holmes skeptically . How does it work ?  I dont know . But put a cube about a yard from your head , and doze off . I think youll have an odd dream . I did . I think the information youll get in your dream will check with what you find around you . Some of it you wont have known before , but youll find its true .  This , said Holmes , I will have to see . Which cube do I try it with , or do I use all of them ?  Theres apparently no way to tell what any of them contains , said Burke . I went back to the storeroom and brought a dozen of them . Take any one and put the others some distance away--maybe outside the ship . Im going to talk to Keller . Hell make a lot of use of this discovery .  Holmes picked up a cube .  Ill try it , he said cheerfully . I go to sleep , perchance to dream . Right! See you later .  Burke moved toward the ships air-lock .  Pam and I have some housekeeping to do , Sandy said .  Burke nodded abstractedly . He left the ship and headed along the mile-long corridor with the turn at the end , a second level and another turn , and then the flight of steps to the instrument-room . As he walked , the sound of his footsteps echoed and reëchoed .  Behind him , Holmes set a cube in a suitable position and curled up on one of the side-wall bunks in the upper compartment of the spaceship .  Well go downstairs , said Sandy .  Pam parted her lips to speak , and did not . They disappeared down the stair to the lower room . Then Sandy came back and picked up the extra cubes .  Joe said to move them , she explained .  She disappeared again . Holmes settled himself comfortably . He was one of those fortunate people who are able to relax at will . Actually , in his work he normally did his thinking while on his feet , moving about his yacht-building plant or else sailing one of his own boats . He simply was not a sit-down thinker . Sitting , he could doze at almost any time he pleased , and for a yachtsman it was a useful ability . He could go for days on snatched catnaps when necessary . Conversely he could catnap practically at will .  He yawned once or twice and settled down confidently . In five minutes or less  . . .         *       *       *       *       *  He wriggled down into an opening barely large enough to admit his body . The top clamped and sealed overhead . He fitted his feet into their proper stirrup-like holders and fixed his hands on the controls . There was violent acceleration and he shot away and ahead . Behind him the jagged shape of the fortress loomed . He swung his tiny ship . He drove fiercely for the tiny rings of red glow which centered themselves in the sighting-screen before him . He drove and drove , while the fortress dwindled to a dot and then vanished .  On either side of his ship a ten-foot steel globe clung . He checked them over , tense with the realization that he must very soon be within the practical timing-range of the new Enemy solid missiles . He made minute adjustments in the settings of the globes .  He released them together . They went swinging madly away at the end of a hair-thin wire which would sustain the tons of stress that centrifugal force gave the spheres . They spiraled toward darkness with its background of innumerable stars . The Enemy would be puzzled , this time! Theyd developed missile-weapons with computing sights . In their last attack , five hundred years before , the Enemy had been defeated by the self-driving globes that had an utterly incredible acceleration . It was reported from the Cathor sector that in this current attack they had missile-weapons with a muzzle-velocity of hundreds of miles per second , which could actually anticipate a globe with a hundred-sixty-gravity drive . They could fire a solid shot to meet it and knock it down , because of some incredible computer-system which was able to calculate a globes trajectory and meet it in space . They were smart , the Enemy!  The two globes went spinning toward the Enemy . Linked together , they spun round and round and no conceivable computer could calculate the path of either one so a projectile could hit . They did not travel in a straight line , as a trajectory in space should be . Whirling as they did around a common center of gravity , with the plane of their circling at a sharp angle to their line of flight , it was not possible to range them for gunfire . Their progress was in a series of curves , each at a different distance , which no mere calculator could solve without direction . A radar could not pick up the data a computer would need . One or the other globe might be hit , but it was far from likely .  The pilot of the one-man ship saw the blue-white flame of a hit . He flung his ship about and sped back toward the fortress . The Enemy would beat this trick , in time . Four thousand years before theyd almost won , when they invaded the Old Nation . They were getting bolder now . There was a time when a sound beating sent them back beyond the Coal-sack to lick their wounds for two thousand years or better . Lately they came more often . Thered been a raid in force only five hundred years back , and only fifteen before that  . . .         *       *       *       *       *  Holmes , obviously , had the odd dream Burke had prophesied . But Burke was up in the instrument-room by then . Keller gazed absorbedly at a vision-plate . It showed a section of the exterior surface of the asteroid--harsh , naked rock , with pitiless sunlight showing the grain and structure of the rock-crystals . Where there was shadow , the blackness was absolute . As Burke entered , Keller turned a knob . The image changed to a picture of a compartment inside the fortress . It was a part of the maze of rooms and galleries that none of the newcomers had visited . Panels and bus-bars and things which were plainly switches covered its walls . It was a power-distribution center . Keller turned the knob back , and the view of the outside of the asteroid returned .  Keller turned and blinked at Burke , and then said happily , Look!  He went to another vision-screen with an image of another part of the outer surface . He turned that knob , and the image dissolved into another . This was a gigantic room , lighted like more familiar places . In its center there was an enormous , gigantic machine . There were domes of metal , with great rods of silvery stuff reaching across emptiness between them . There were stairs by which one could climb to this part and that . Judging by the steps and the size of the light-tubes , the machine was the size of a four-storey house . And on the floor there were smaller machines , all motionless and all cryptic .  Keller said with conviction , Power!  Burke stared . Keller recovered the original view and went to still other plates . In succession , as he turned the knobs , Burke saw compartment after compartment . There was one quite as huge as the one containing the power-generating machine . It contained hemispheres bolted ten feet above the floor on many columns . There was a network of bus-bars , it seemed , overlying everything , and there were smaller devices on the floor below it .  Gravity! said Keller with conviction .  Good enough , said Burke . Weve found something too , which may be useful with those machines . If we can--  Keller held up his hand and went to one special screen . When he changed the image , the new one was totally unlike any of the others . This was a close-up . It showed a clumsy , strictly improvised and definitely cobbled metal case against a wall . It had been made by inept hands . It was remarkable to see such indifferent workmanship here . But the really remarkable thing was that the face of the box contained an inscription , burned into the metal as if by a torch . The symbols had no meaning to Burke , of course . But this was an inscription in a written language .  Keller rubbed his hands , beaming .  It could be a message for somebody whod come later , said Burke . Its hard to think of it being anything else . But it wasnt placed for us to find . It should have been set up beside the ship-lock we were expected to come in by and did come in by .  Well see , said Keller zestfully . Come on!  Burke followed him . Keller seemed somehow to know the way . They went all the way back to the ship-lock , passed it , and then Keller dived off to the right , down an unsuspected ramp . There were galleries running in every direction here , crossing each other and opening upon an indefinite number of what must have been storerooms . Presently Keller pointed .  There was the case against the wall . It faced a wide corridor . It did not belong here . It was totally unlike any other artifact they had seen , because it seemed to have been made totally without skill . Yet there was an inscription--and the making of written records had appeared to be a skill the former occupants of the asteroid had not possessed . Keller very zestfully essayed to open it . He failed .  Burke said , Well have to use tools to get it open .  Somebody made it , said Keller , just before the garrison went away . They made it here!  Quite likely , agreed Burke . Well get at it presently . Now listen , Keller! I came along because a message might be useful . I think Holmes has found out something , though what it may be I cant guess . Come along with me . Thereve been developments and I want to hold a council of war . And I think I do mean war!  He led the way back toward the ship . When they arrived , Holmes was awake and growling because of Burkes absence .  You win , he told Burke . I had a dream , and it wasnt a dream . I know something about those metal globes . Theyve got drives in them , and they can accelerate to a hundred and sixty gees , and I dont think Ill ride one .  Wryly , he told Burke what hed experienced .  Im not too much surprised , said Burke . Ive managed two cube-experiences myself . I figure that these cubes trained men to operate things , without training their brains in anything else . Theyd make illiterates into skilled men in a particular line , so anybody could do the work a highly trained man would otherwise be needed for . In one of my two cube-dreams I was a gun-pointer on one of those machines up on the third level . In the second cube-dream I was a rocket-pilot .  No rockets in my cube , protested Holmes .  Different period , said Burke . Maybe , anyhow . In my dream we were using rockets to fight with , and the war was close . The enemy had taken some planets off Kandu--wherever that is!--and the situation was bad . We went out of here in rockets and fought all over the sky . But then there were supplies coming from home , and fresh fighting men turning up . He stopped abruptly . Howd they come ? I dont know . But I know they didnt come in spaceships . They just came , and they were new men and we veterans patronized them . The devil! Holmes , you say the globes have a hundred-sixty-gee drive! Nobodyd use rockets if drives like that were known!  To stay in the party , Sandy said suddenly , with something like defiance , I tried a cube , too . And I was a sort of supply-officer . I had the experience of being responsible for supply and being short of everything and improvising this and that and the other to keep things up to fighting standard . It wasnt easy . The men grumbled , and we lacked everything . There was no fighting in my time , and there hadnt been for centuries . But we knew the Enemy hadnt given up and we had to be ready , generation after generation , even when nothing happened . And we knew that any minute the Enemy might throw something unexpected , some new weapon , at us .  History-cubes , said Keller interestedly . Different periods . Right ?  Dammit , yes! said Burke . Weve got accounts of past times and finished battles , but we need to know whos coming and what to do about it! Maybe the rocket-dream was earliest in time . But how could a race with nothing better than rockets ever get here ? And how could they supply the building of a place like this ?  There was no answer . Facts ought to fit together . When they dont , they are useless .  Weve got snatches of information , said Burke . But we dont know who built this fort , or why , except that there was a war that lasted thousands of years , with pauses for centuries between battles . He waved a hand irritably . The Enemy tries to think up new weapons . They do . They try them . So far , theyve been countered . But were not prepared to fight a new weapon . Maybe the fort is set to battle old ones , but we dont know how to use it even for that! Weve got to--  I think-- began Keller .  Id give plenty for a service manual on the probably useless weapons we do have , said Burke angrily . Incidentally , Keller just found what may be an explanation of how and why this place was abandoned .  Keller said suddenly , Where would service manuals be ?  He moved , almost running , toward the air-lock . Burke started to swear , and stopped .  A service-and-repair manual , he snapped , would be near the equipment it described . How many little shelves with boxes on them have we seen ? Theyre just the right size to hold cubes! And where are they ? Next to those fighting machines next to the door of the room where the ten-foot globes are! Theres a shelf of them in the instrument-room! Lets find out how to fight with this misbegotten shell of a space-fort! Therell be no help coming to us , but if the Enemys held off for thousands of years while this civilization fell apart , we might as well try to hold it together for a few minutes or seconds longer! Lets go get some real instruction-cubes!  Keller was already gone . The others followed . Once they saw Keller in the far , far distance , hastening toward the instrument-room . Behind him , after almost running down the long corridor , Burke swung into the room where hundreds of ten-foot metal globes waited for the fortress to be remanned and to go into action again . Inside the door he found the remembered shelf , with two small boxes fastened to it . He pulled down one box and opened it . There was a black cube inside it . He thrust it upon Holmes .  Here! he said feverishly . Find out how those globes work! Find out whats in them , how they drive!  He ran . To the end of the corridor and up the ramp and past the supposed bunk-rooms and mess-halls . Up to the level where the ugly metal machines stood , each in its separate cubicle . There were little shelves inside each door . Each shelf contained a single box . Burke took one , two , and then stopped short .  Theyll be practically alike , he muttered . No need .  He put one back . And then he felt almost insanely angry . One would need at least to be able to doze , to make use of the detailed , vivid , and utterly convincing material contained in the black cubes . And how could any man doze or sleep for the purpose of learning such desperately needed data ? Hed need almost not to want the information to be able to sleep to get it!  Sandy and Pam overtook him as he stood in harried frustration with a black cube in his hands .  Listen to me , Joe , said Sandy . Weve all taken chances , but if you get recurrent dreams from every cube you doze near--  When that happened to me , snapped Burke , I was eleven years old and had one moment only . And that dream wasnt affected by the others in the cubes that came after it . And anyhow , no matter what happens to Holmes and me , we have to get these things ready for use! I dont know what well use them against . I dont know whether theyll be any use at all . But Ive got to try to use them , so Ive got to try to find out how!  Sandy opened her mouth to speak again .  Im going off to fret myself to sleep , added Burke . Holmes will be trying it too . And Keller .  I dont think its necessary , said Sandy .  Why ?  You found a sort of library of cubes . How useful would they be if one had to doze off to read them ? How handy would a manual about repairing a weapon be , if somebody had to take a nap to get instructions ? It wouldnt make sense!  Go on! said Burke impatiently .  Why not look in the library ? asked Sandy . As a quartermaster officer , I think I knew that there was a reading-device for the cubes , like a projector for microfilm . It might have been taken away , but also--  Come along! snapped Burke . If thats so , its everything! And it ought to be so!  They hastened to the vast , low-ceilinged room which was filled with racks of black cubes . They were stacked in their places . At the far corner they found a desk and a cabinet . In the cabinet they found two objects like metal skull-caps , with clamps atop them . A cube would fit between the clamps . Burke feverishly sat a cube in position and put the skull-cap on his head . His expression was strange . After an instant he took it off and reversed the cube . He put it on . His face cleared . He lifted it off .  I had it on backwards the first time , he said curtly . This is better than dreaming the stuff . This lets you examine things in detail . You know youre receiving something . You dont think youre actually experiencing . Well get this other reading-machine to Keller , so he can understand the equipment in the instrument-room . Holmes will have to wait .  Sandy said , I can use him . Doesnt it occur to you , Joe , that weve only partly explored the top half of the fortress ? Weve only looked at whats between us and the instrument-room . There are all the stores--there were stores! And the generators down below . I can lead the way there now!  What do you know about the weapons ? demanded Burke .  Nothing , said Sandy . But I know something about the morale of the garrison . When grumbling began , discipline tightened up . And that worked for the men , but the women--  Women! said Pam incredulously .  They were an experiment , Sandy told her , to see if they would content men on duty in an outpost . Itd been going on for only a few hundred years . It didnt seem to work too well . They wanted supplies that werent exactly military , and at the time the cube I used was made , there was trouble getting even military things!  Burke said impatiently , Ill get one of these things to Keller . Thats the most important thing . Tell Holmes not to try to sleep . Take him down to look over the supplies , if there are any . Id guess that the garrison took most of them along . I doubt theres much left that we could use .  He made his way out of the cube-library and vanished .  Pam said uncomfortably , Joe dreamed about a woman and is no good to you , in consequence . If there were women in this garrison , using the cubes might make anybody--  Sandy tensed her lips .  I dont think Joe is thinking about his old dream . Something deadlys on the way here . His minds on that . I suspect all three of the men are concentrating on it . Theyre in no mood for romance .  Dont you think Ive noticed ? Pam said gloomily . But Im coming with you when you show him the storerooms!  The him was obviously Holmes , whose attention had been so much taken up by the problems the fortress presented that Pam felt pushed much farther on the side lines than she liked . It was one thing to be present to watch and help and cheer on a man who planned to do something remarkable . But it was less satisfying when he became so absorbed that he didnt notice being watched , and couldnt be helped , and didnt need to be cheered on . Pam was disgruntled .  Then , for a considerable number of hours , absurdly trivial activities seemed to occupy all the people in the asteroid . Burke and Keller sat in the thirty by thirty-foot instrument-room , each wearing a small metal half-cap with a black cube held atop it between a pair of clamps . Their expressions were absorbed and intent , while they seemed attired for a childrens halloween party . Now and again one of them exchanged one cube for another . About them there was a multiplicity of television screens , each screen presenting a picture of infinitely perfect quality . Every square foot of the outside of the asteroid could be seen on one or another of the screens . Then , besides , there were banks of screens which showed every square degree of the sky , with every star of every magnitude represented so that one could use a magnifying glass upon the screen to discover finer detail .  Once , during the hours when Burke and Keller were sitting quite still , Keller reached over and threw a switch . Nothing happened . Everything went on exactly as it had done before . He shook his head . And much later he went to one of the star-image screens . He moved an inconspicuous knob in a special fashion , and the star-image expanded and expanded until what had been a second of arc or less filled all the screens surface . The effect of an incredibly powerful telescope was obtained by the movement of one control . Keller restored the knob to its original place and the image returned to its former scale . These were the only actions which took place in the instrument-room .  In the lower part of the asteroid , not much more occurred . The entrance to the power and storage areas was not hidden . It simply had not been entered . Sandy and Holmes and Pam went gingerly down a corridor with doors on either side , and then down a ramp , and then into huge caverns filled with monstrous metal things . There was no sign of any motion anywhere , but gigantic power-leads led from the machines to massive switchboards , whose switches were thrown by relays operated from somewhere else .  Then there were other caverns which must have contained many varieties of stores . There were great cases , broken open and emptied . There were bins with only dust at their bottoms . There were shelves containing things which might have been textiles , but which crumbled at a touch . Some thousands of years in an absolute vacuum would have evaporated any substance giving any degree of flexibility . These objects were useless . There was a great room with a singular hundred-foot-high machine in it , but there was no vibration or sound to indicate that it was in operation . This , Sandy said decisively , was the artificial-gravity generator . She did not know how it worked . It would have been indiscreet to experiment .  She led the way through relatively small corridors to areas in which there were very many small compartments . These had been for foodstuffs . But they were empty . They had been emptied when the asteroid was abandoned .  Then they came to the crudely fashioned case with the cryptic symbols on its front .  This is the thing Joe mentioned , said Sandy . They had writing . Theyd have to , to be civilized . But this is the only writing weve seen . Whyd they write it ?  To tell somebody something theyd miss , otherwise , Pam said .  Whod come down here ? Why not put it at the ship-lock where people could be expected to come ?  Holmes grunted . Asking questions like that gets nowhere . Its like asking how the garrison was supplied . Theres no answer . Or how it left .  Sandy said in a surprised voice , as if saying something she hadnt realized she knew . There were service ships . They serviced the television eyes on the outside , and they drilled at launching missiles , and so on . They were modified fighting ships , made over after ships didnt fight any more .  She hesitated , then went on .  Its odd that I didnt think of telling Joe this! Some of the food supply came from Earth at the time my cube was made . As a quartermaster officer , I was authorized to allow hunting on Earth in case of need . So the serviceships went to Earth and came back with mammoths tied to the outside of their hulls . They had to be re-hydrated , though . Frozen though they were , they dried out in the long trip through vacuum from Earth .  Then she shivered a little .  Pam looked at her strangely . Holmes raised his eyebrows . Hed had one experience of training-cubes . Sandyd had quite another . Holmes felt that instinctive slight resentment a man feels when he lacks a position of authority in the presence of a woman .  In my time--in the cubes time--there was even a hunting camp on Earth . Otherwise there simply wouldnt be enough to eat! Women were clamoring to be sent to Earth to help with the food supply . To be sent to hunt for food was a reward for exemplary service .  Which is interesting , observed Holmes , but irrelevant . How was the asteroid normally supplied ? How did the garrison leave ? Where did it come from ? Where did it go ? Maybe the answers in this box . If it is , he added , itll be in the same language as the inscription , and we cant read it .  Archaeologists on Earth would have been enraptured by any part of the fortress , but anything which promised to explain as much as Holmes had guessed the case could , would be a treasure past any price .  But the five people in the asteroid had much more immediate and much more urgent problems to think of . They went on a little farther and came to a storeroom which had been filled with something , but now held only the remains of packing-cases . They looked ready to crumble if touched .  There used to be weapons stored here , Sandy said . Hand-weapons . Not for the defense of the fortress , but for the--discipline police . For the men who kept the others obedient to orders .  Id be glad to have one operating pea-shooter , said Holmes .  Pam wrinkled her nose suddenly . Shed noticed something .  I think-- she began , I think--  Holmes kicked at a shape which once was probably a case of wood or something similar . It collapsed into impalpable dust . It had dried out to absolute desiccation . It was stripped of every molecule which could be extracted by a total vacuum in thousands of years . It was brittle past imagining .  The collapse did not end with the object kicked . It spread . One case bulged as the support of another failed . The bulged case disintegrated . Its particles pressed on another . The dissolution spread fanwise until nothing remained but a carpeting of infinitely fine brown stuff . In one place , however , solid objects remained under the covering .  Holmes waded through the powder to the solid things . He brought them up . A case of hand-weapons had collapsed , but the weapons themselves kept their shape . They had transparent plastic barrels with curiously formed metal parts inside them .  These might be looked into , said Holmes .  He stuffed his pockets . The hand-weapons had barrels and handgrips and triggers . They were made to shoot , somehow .  I think-- began Pam again .  Dont , growled Holmes . Maybe Sandy remembers when this place was different , but Ive had enough of it as it is . Lets go back to the ship and some fresh air .  But thats what--  Holmes turned away . Like the rest , hed accepted great age , mentally , as a part of the nature of the fortress . But the collapse of emptied shipping-cases because they were touched was a shock . Where such decay existed , one could not hope to find anything useful for a modern emergency . He vanished .  Pam was indignant . She turned to Sandy .  I wanted to say that I smelled fresh air , she protested . And he acts like that!  Sandy was not listening . She frowned .  He could lose his way down here , she said shortly . Wed better keep him in sight . I remember the way from my dream .  They followed Holmes , who did make his way back to the upper levels and ultimately to the ship without guidance . But Pam was intensely indignant .  We could have gotten lost down there! she said angrily when they were back in familiar territory . And he wouldnt have cared! And I did smell fresh air! Not very fresh , but fresher than the aged and dried-out stuff were breathing now!  You couldnt , said Sandy practically . There simply couldnt be any , except in the ship where the hydroponic wall-gardens keep it fresh .  But I did! insisted Pam .  Sandy shrugged . They went into the ship , which Holmes had already reached and where he sat gloomily beside a black cube . He would have to sleep to get anything from it . There were only two of the freakish-seeming metal caps which made the cubes intelligible to a man awake , and Burke and Keller were using them . Holmes felt offended .  Sandy looked at a clock and began to prepare a meal . Pam , brooding , helped her .  Burke and Keller came back to the ship together . Keller looked pale . Burke seemed utterly grim .  Theres some stuff to be coded and sent back to Earth , he told Sandy . Kellers got it written out . We know how to work the instruments up above , now . My brains reeling a little , but I think Ill stay sane . Keller takes it in stride . And we know the trick the Enemy has .  Sandy put out plates for five .  What is it ?  Gravity , said Burke , evenly . Artificial gravity . We dont know how to make it , but the people who built this fortress did , and the Enemy does . So theyve made artificial-gravity fields to give their ships the seeming mass of suns , and theyve set them in close orbits around each other . Theyll come spinning into this solar system . What will happen when objects with the mass of suns--artificial or otherwise--come riding through between our sun and its planets ? Therell be tidal stresses to crack the planets and let out their internal fires . Therell be no stability left in the sun . Maybe itll be a low-grade nova when theyve gone , surrounded by trash that once was worlds . Anyhow therell be no humans left! And then the Enemy will go driving on toward the other solar systems that the builders of this fortress own . They cant conquer anything with a weapon like that , but they can surely destroy!  Keller nodded distressedly . He gave Pam a number of sheets of paper , filled with his neat handwriting .  He said sorrowfully , For Earth . In code .  Sandy served the meal she had prepared .  Its a matter of days , said Burke curtly . Not weeks . Just days .  He picked up a fork and began his meal .  So , he said after a moment , with a sort of unnatural calm , weve got to get the thing licked fast . Up in the instrument-room there are some theory-cubes--lectures on theories with which the operators of the room were probably required to be familiar . They were intended to figure out what the Enemy might come up with , so it could at least be reported before the fortress was destroyed . The trick of sun-gravity fields was suggested as possible , but it seemed preposterously difficult . Apparently , it was . It took the Enemy some thousands of years to get it . But theyve got it , all right!  How do you know ? demanded Holmes .  The disk with the red sparks in it , said Burke , is a detector of gravity-fields . It sees by gravity , which is not radiation . Kellers sending instructions back to Earth telling how to make such detectors .  He busied himself with his food once more . After a moment he spoke again .  Were going to try to get some help , he observed . At least well try to find out if theres any help to be had . I think theres a chance . There was a civilization which built this fortress . Something happened to it . Perhaps it simply collapsed , like Rome and Greece and Egypt and Babylonia back on Earth . But on Earth when an old civilization died a new , young one rose in its place . If the one that built this fort collapsed , maybe a new one has risen in its stead . If so , it will need to defend itself against the Enemy just like the old culture did . It might prefer to do its fighting here , instead of in its own land . I think we may be able to contact it .  Howll you look for them ?  Burke shrugged .  Ive some faint hope of a few directions in that sealed-up metal case with the inscription on it . Im going to take some tools and break into it . Its a gamble , but theres nothing to lose .  He ate briskly , with a good appetite . Sandy was very silent .  Pam said abruptly , We saw that case . And I smelled fresh air there . Not pure air like here in the ship , but not dead air like the air everywhere else .  Near a power generator , Pam , thered be some ozone , Holmes said patiently . It makes a lot of difference .  It wasnt ozone , said Pam firmly . It was fresh air . Not canned air . Fresh!  Holmes looked at Burke .  Did you or Keller find out how the airs refreshed here ? Did anybody throw a switch for air apparatus ?  Keller said mildly , Apparatus , no . Air exchange , yes . I threw switches also for communication with base . Also emergency communication . Also dire emergency . Nothing happened .  You see , Pam ? said Holmes . It was ozone that made the air smell fresh .  Sandy was wholly silent until the meal was over . Then Holmes went moodily off with Keller , to use the cube-reading devices in the instrument-room and try to find , against all apparent probability , some clue or some communication which would enable something useful to be done . Holmes was trying hard to believe that things were not as bad as Burke announced , and not nearly so desperate that they had to try to find the descendants of a long-vanished civilization for a chance to offer resistance to the Enemy .  Keller said confidentially , just before they reached the instrument-room , Burkes an optimist .  And at that moment , back in the little plastic spaceship , Burke was saying to Sandy , You can come along if you like . There are a couple of things to be looked into . And if you want to come , Pam--  But Pam touched the papers Keller had given her and said reservedly , Ill code and send this stuff . Go ahead , Sandy .  Sandy rose . She followed Burke out of the ship . She was acutely aware that this was the first time since they had entered the ship that she and Burke could speak to each other when nobody could overhear . Theyd spoken twice when the others were presumably asleep . But this was the first time theyd been alone .  When theyd passed through the door with the rounded corners , they were completely isolated . Overhead , brilliant light-tubes reached a full mile down the gallery in one direction , and half as far in the other . The vast corridor contained nothing to make a sound but themselves .  Its this way , said Burke .  Sandy knew the way as well as he did , or better , but she accepted his direction . Their footsteps echoed and reëchoed , so that they were accompanied by countless reflections of heel-clicks along with the normal rustling and whispering sounds of walking .  They went a full quarter-mile from the ship-lock door , and came to a very large arched opening which gave entrance to a corridor slanting downward .  Supplies came up this ramp , said Sandy .  It was a statement which should have been startling , but Burke nodded .  Sandy went on , carefully , That cube about a supply-officers duties was pretty explicit . Things were getting difficult .  Burke did not seem to hear . They went on and on . They came to the place where Keller had turned aside . Burke silently indicated the turning . They moved along this other gallery .  Joe , said Sandy pleadingly . Is it really so bad ?  Strictly speaking , I dont see a chance . But thats just the way it looks now . There must be something that can be done . The trick is to find it . Meantime , why panic ?  You--act queer , protested Sandy .  I feel queer , he said . I know various ways to approach problems . None of them apply to this one . You see , it isnt really our problem . Were innocent bystanders , without information about the situation that apparently will kill us and everybody back on Earth . If we knew more about the situation , we might find some part of it that could be tackled , changed . There may be something in this case--perhaps a message left by the garrison for the people who sent them here . I cant see why itd be placed here , though .  He slowed , looking down one cross-gallery after another .  Here it is .  Theyd come to the clumsily-made case with the inscription on it . It was placed against the wall of a corridor , facing the length of another gallery which came from the side at this point . A little distance down the other passage , the line of doors was broken by an archway which gave upon a hewed-out compartment . The opening was wide enough to show a fragment of a metal floor . There was no sign of any contents . Other compartments nearby were empty . The placing of the inscribed box was inexplicable . But the inscription was sharply clear .  Maybe , suggested Sandy forlornly , it says something like Explosives! Danger!  Not likely , said Burke .  Hed examined the box before . Hed brought along a tool suited to the job of opening it . He set to work , then stopped .  Sandy , he said abruptly , I think the gravity-generators a couple of corridors in that direction . Will you look and see if there are any tools there that might be better than this ? Just look for a place where tools might be stored . If you find something , call me .  She went obediently down the lighted , excavated corridor . She reached the vast cavern . Here there were myriad tube-lights glowing in the ceiling--and the gravity machine . It was gigantic . It was six storeys high and completely mysterious .  She looked with careful intentness for a place where tools might have been kept by the machines attendants .  She saw movement out of the corner of her eye , but when she turned there was nothing . There could be no movement in the fortress unless by machinery or one of the five humans whod come so recently . The asteroid had been airless for ten thousand years . It was unthinkable that anything alive , even a microbe , could have survived . So Sandy did not think of a living thing as having made the movement . But movement there had been .  She stared . There were totally motionless machines all about . None of them showed any sign of stirring . Sandy swallowed the ache in her throat and it returned instantly . She moved , to look where the movement had been . She glanced at each machine in turn . One might have made some automatic adjustment . Shed tell Burke .  She passed a fifteen-foot-high assembly of insulators and bright metal , connected overhead to other cryptic things by heavy silvery bars . She passed a cylinder with dials in its sides .  She saw movement again . In a different place . She spun around to look .  Something half the height of a man , with bird-legs and feet and swollen plumage and a head with an oversized beak which was pure caricature--something alive and frightened fled from her . It waddled in ridiculous , panicky haste . It flapped useless stumps of wings . It fled in terrified silence . It vanished .  The first thing that occurred to Sandy was that Burke wouldnt believe her if she told him .     Chapter 9   Burke found her , rooted to the spot . He had a small metal box in his hand . He didnt notice her pallor nor that she trembled .  I may have something , he said with careful calm . The case had this in it . Theres a black cube in the box . The case seems to have been made to hold and call attention to this cube . Ill take it up to the instrument-room and use a reader on it .  He led the way . Sandy followed , her throat dry . She knew , of course , that he was under almost intolerable emotional strain . Hed brought her along to be with her for a few moments , but he was so tense that he could think of nothing personal to say . Now it was not possible for him to talk of anything at all .  Yet Sandy realized that even under the stress that pressed upon him , hed asked her to go look for tools in the gravity-machine room because shed spoken of possible danger in the opening of the case . Hed gotten her away while he opened it .  When they reached the ship-lock he said briefly , I want to hurry , Sandy . Wait for me in the ship ?  She nodded , and went to the small spacecraft which had brought them all from Earth .  When she saw Pam , inside , she said shakily , Is--anybody else here ?  No , said Pam . Why ?  Sandy sat down and shivered .  I think , she said through chattering teeth , I think Im going to have hysterics . L-listen , Pam! I--I saw something alive! It was like a bird this high and big as a--There arent any birds like that! There cant be anything alive here but us! But I saw it! And it saw me and ran away!  Pam stared and asked questions , at first soothing ones . But presently she was saying indignantly , I do believe it! Thats near the place where I smelled fresh air!  Of course , fresh air in the asteroid , two hundred and seventy million miles from Earth , was as impossible as what Sandy had seen .  Holmes came in presently , depressed and tired . Hed been filling his mind with the contents of black cubes . He knew how cooking was done in the kitchens of the fortress , some eons since . He knew how to prepare for inspection of the asteroid by a high-ranking officer . He was fully conversant with the bugle-calls once used in the fortress in the place of a public-address loud-speaker system . But hed found no hint of how the fortress received its supplies , nor how the air was freshened , nor how reinforcements of men used to reach the asteroid . He was discouraged and vexed and weary .  Sandy , said Pam challengingly , saw a live bird , bigger than a goose , in the gravity-machine room .  Holmes shrugged .  Kellers fidgeting , he observed , because he thinks hes seen movements in the vision-plates that show different inside views of this thing . But he isnt sure that hes seen anything move . Maybe were all going out of our minds .  Then Joes closest , said Pam darkly . He worries about Sandy!  And very reasonably , said Holmes tiredly . Pam , this business of figuring that theres something deadly on the way and nothing to do about it--its got me down!  He slumped in a chair . Pam frowned at him . Sandy sat perfectly still , her hands clenched .  Burke came back twenty minutes later . His expression was studiedly calm .  Ive found out where the garrison went , he said matter-of-factly . Im afraid we cant get any help from them . Or anybody else .  Sandy looked at him mutely . He was completely self-controlled , and he did not look like a man resolutely refusing to despair , but Sandy knew him . To her it seemed that his eyes had sunk a little in his head .  Apparently theres nobody left on the world the garrison came from , said Burke in the tone of someone saying perfectly commonplace things , so they didnt go back there and theres no use in our trying to make a contact with that world . This was an outpost fortress , you know . It was reached from somewhere far away , and carved out and armed to fight an enemy that didnt attack it for itself , but to get at the world or worlds that made it .  He continued with immoderate calm , I believe the home world of that civilization has two moons in its sky and something off at the horizon that looks like a hill , but isnt .  But--  The garrison left , explained Burke , because it was abandoned . It was left behind to stand off the Enemy , and the civilization it belonged to moved away . It was left without supplies , without equipment , without hope . It was left behind even without training to face abandonment , because its members had been trained by black cubes and only knew how to do their own highly special jobs by rote . They were just ordinary soldiers , like the Roman detachments left behind when the legions marched south from Hadrians Wall and sailed for Gaul . So when there was nothing left for them to do but leave their post or starve--because they couldnt follow the civilization that had abandoned them--they left . The cube in the box was a message they set up for their former rulers and fellow-citizens if they ever returned . Its not a pretty message!  Sandy swallowed .  Whered they go ? What happened to them ?  They went to Earth , said Burke tonelessly . By twos and fives and dozens , in the service ships that came out with meat , and took back passengers . The service ships had been assigned to bring out what meat the hunting-parties could kill . They took back men who were fighters and ready to face mammoths or sabre tooth tigers or anything else . Just the same , they left a transmitter to call them back if the Enemy ever came again . But it didnt come in their lifetimes , and their descendants forgot . But the transmitter remembered . It called to them . And--we were the ones to answer!  Sandy hesitated a moment .  But if the garrison went to Earth , she said dubiously , what became of them ? There arent any traces--  Were traces , said Burke . They were our ancestors of ten or twenty thousand years ago . They couldnt build a civilization . They were fighting men! Could the Romans left behind at Hadrians Wall keep up the culture of Rome ? Of course not! The garrison went to Earth and turned savage , and their childrens childrens children built up a new civilization . And for here and for now , were it . Weve got to face the Enemy and drive him back .  He stopped , and said in a tone that was almost completely steady and held no hint of despair , Its going to be quite a job . But its an emergency . Weve got to manage it somehow .  There was also an emergency on Earth , not simplified as in space by having somebody like Burke accept the burden of meeting it . The emergency stemmed from the fact that despite the best efforts of the air arm of the United States , Burke and the others had gotten out to space . Theyd reached the asteroid M-387 . Naturally . The United States thereupon took credit for this most creditable achievement . Inevitably . And it was instantly and frantically denounced for suspected space-imperialism , space-monopoly , and intended space-exploitation .  But when Kellers painstaking instructions for the building of gravity-field detectors reached Earth , these suspicions seemed less plausible . The United States passed on the instructions . The basic principle was so new that nobody could claim it , but it was so simple that many men felt a wholesome shame that they had not thought of it before . Nobody could question a natural law which was so obvious once it was stated . And the building of the device required next to no time at all .  Within days then , where the asteroid had a single ten-foot instrument , the United States had a ten-foot , a thirty-foot and a sixty-foot gravity-field detector available to qualified researchers . The new instruments gave data such as no astronomer had ever hoped for before . The thirty-foot disk , tuned for short range , pictured every gravitational field in the solar system . A previously unguessed-at Saturnian moon , hidden in the outer ring , turned up . All the asteroids could be located at one instant . The mystery of the inadequate mass of Pluto was solved within hours of turning on the thirty-foot device .  When the sixty-foot instrument went on , scaled to take in half a hundred light-years of space , the solar system was a dot on it . But four dark stars , one with planets , and twenty-odd planetary systems were mapped within a day . On that same day , though , a query went back to Keller . What , said the query , was the meaning of certain crawling , bright-red specks in mathematically exact relationship to each other , which were visibly in motion and much closer to Earth than Alpha Centaurus ? Alpha Centaurus had always been considered the closest of all stars to Earth . Under magnification the bright-red sparks wove and interwove their paths as if about a common center of gravity . If such a thing were not impossible , it would be guessed that they were suns so close together as to revolve about one another within hours . Even more preposterously , they moved through space at a rate which was a multiple of the speed of light . Thirty light-speeds , of course , could not be . And the direction of their motion seemed to be directly toward the glowings which represented the solar system containing Earth . All this was plainly absurd . But what was the cause of this erroneous report from the new device ?  Keller wrote out very neatly , The instrument here shows the same phenomenon . Its appearance much farther away triggered the transmitter here to send the first signals to Earth . Data suggests red dots represent artificial gravity-fields strong enough to warp space and produce new spatial constants including higher speed for light , hence possible higher speed for spacecraft carrying artificial gravity generators . Request evaluation this possibility .  Pam coded it and sent it to Earth . And presently , on Earth , astronomers looked at each other helplessly . Because Keller had stated the only possible explanation . Objects like real suns , if so close together , would tear each other to bits and fuse in flaming novas . Moreover , the pattern of motion of the red-spark-producing objects could not have come into being of itself . It was artificial . There was a group of Things in motion toward Earths solar system . They would arrive within so many days . They were millions of miles apart , but their gravity-fields were so strong that they orbited each other within hours . If they had gravity-fields , they had mass , which could be as artificial as their gravity . And , whirling about each other in the maddest of dances , ten suns passing through the human solar system could leave nothing but debris behind them .  Oddly enough , the ships that made those gravity-fields might be so small as to be beyond the power of a telescope to detect at a few thousand miles . The destruction of all the solar planets and the sun itself might be accomplished by motes . They would not need to use power for destruction . Gravitation is not expended any more than magnetism , when something is attracted by it . The artificial gravity-fields would only need to be built up . They had been . Once created , they could exist forever without need for added power , just as the sun and planets do not expend power for their mutual attraction , and as the Earth parts with no energy to keep its moon a captive .  The newspapers did not publish this news . But , very quietly , every civilized government on Earth got instructions for the making of a gravity-field detector . Most had them built . And then for the first time in human history there was an actual and desperately honest attempt to poll all human knowledge and all human resources for a common human end . For once , no eminent figure assumed the undignified pose involved in standing on ones dignity . For once , the public remained unworried and undisturbed while the heads of states aged visibly .  Naturally some of the people in the secret frantically demanded that the five in the fortress solve the problem all the science of Earth could not even attack . Incredible lists of required information items went out to Burke and Keller and Holmes . Keller read the lists calmly and tried to answer the questions that seemed to make sense . Holmes doggedly spent all his time experiencing cubes in the hope that by sheer accident he might come upon something useful . Pam , scowling , coded and decoded without pause . And Sandy looked anxiously at Burke .  Im going to ask you to do something for me , she said . When we went down to the Lower Levels , I thought I saw something moving . Something alive .  Nerves , said Burke . There couldnt be anything alive in this place . Not after so many years without air .  I know , acknowledged Sandy . I know its ridiculous . But Pams felt creepy , too , as if there were something deadly somewhere in the rooms weve never been in .  Burke moved his head impatiently . Well ?  Holmes found some hand-weapons , said Sandy . They dont work , of course . Will you fix one for Pam and one for me so that they do ? She paused and added , Of course it doesnt matter whether were frightened or not , considering . It doesnt even matter whether there is something alive . It doesnt matter if were killed . But it would be pleasant not to feel defenseless .  Burke shrugged . Ill fix them .  She put three of the transparent-barreled weapons before him and said , Im going up to the instrument-room and help Pam with her coding .  She went out . Burke took the three hand-weapons and looked at them without interest . But in a technician of any sort there is always some response to a technical problem . A trivial thing like a hand-weapon out of order could hold Burkes attention simply because it did not refer to the coming disaster .  He loosened the hand-grip plates and looked at the completely simple devices inside the weapons . There was a tiny battery , of course . In thousands of years its electrolyte had evaporated . Burke replaced it from the water stores of the ship . He did the same to the other two weapons . Then , curious , he stepped out of the ships air-lock and aimed at the ship-lock wall . He pressed the trigger . There was a snapping sound and a fragment of rock fell . He tried the others . They fired something . It was not a bullet . The barrels of the weapons , on inspection , were not hollow . They were solid . The weapons fired a thrust , a push , an immaterial blow which was concentrated on a tiny spot . They punched , with nothing solid to do the punching .  Probably punch a hole right through a man , said Burke , reflectively .  He took the three weapons and went toward the instrument-room . On the way , his mind went automatically back to the coming destruction . It was completely arbitrary . The Enemy had no reason to destroy the human race in this solar system . Men , here , had lost all recollection of their origin and assuredly all memory of enmities known before memory began . If any tradition remained of the fortress , even , it would be hidden in tales of a Golden Age before Pandora was , or of an Age of Innocence when all things came without effort . Those stories were changed out of all semblance to their foundations , of course , as ever-more-ignorant and ever-more-unsophisticated generations retold them . Perhaps the Golden Age was a garbled memory of a time when machines performed tasks for men--before the machines wore out and could not be replaced without other machines to make them . Perhaps the slow development of tools , with which men did things that machines formerly did for them , blurred the accounts of times when men did not need to use tools . Even the everywhere-present traditions of a long , long journey in a boat--the flood legends--might be the last trace of grand-sires yarns about a journey to Earth . It would have been modified by successive generations who could not imagine a journey through emptiness , and therefore devised a flood as a more scientific and reasonable explanation for myths plainly overlaid with fantasy and superstition .  Burke went into the instrument-room as Sandy was asking , But how did they ? We havent found any ship-lock except the one we came in by! And if a ship cant travel faster than light without wrapping artificial mass about itself  . . .  Holmes had taken off his helmet He said doggedly , Theres nothing about ships in the cubes . Anyhow , the nearest other sun is four light-years away . Nobodyd try to carry all the food a whole colony would need from as far away as that! If theyd used ships for supply , thered have been hydroponic gardens all over the place to ease the load the ships had to carry! There was some other way to get stuff here!  Whatever it was , it didnt bring meat from Earth . That was hauled out , fastened to the outside of service-boats .  Another thing , Holmes said . There were thousands of people in the garrison , here . How did the air get renewed ? Nobodys found any mention of air-purifying apparatus in the cubes . Theres been no sign of any! An emergency air-supply , yes . It was let loose when we came into the ship-lock . But theres no regular provision for purifying the air and putting oxygen into it and breaking down the CO{2}!  Wont anyone believe I smelled fresh air yesterday ? Pam asked plaintively .  No one commented . It could not be believed . Burke handed Sandy one of the weapons . He gave Pam a second .  They work very much like the ship-drive , which was developed from them . A battery in the handle energizes them so they use the heat they contain to make a lethal punch without a kick-back . Theyll get pretty cold after a dozen or so shots .  He sat down and Holmes went on almost angrily , The garrison had to get food here . It didnt come in ships . They had to purify the air . Theyve nothing to do it with! How did they manage ?  Keller smiled faintly . He pointed to a control on the wall .  If that worked , we could ask . It is supposed to be communication with base . It is turned on . Nothing happens .  Do you know what Im thinking ? demanded Holmes . Im thinking of a matter-transmitter! Its been pointed out before that well never reach the stars in spaceships limited to one light-speed . What good would be voyages that lasted ten , twenty , or fifty years each way ? But if there could be matter-transmitters--  Keller said gently , Transmitters , no . Transposers , yes .  It was a familiar enough distinction . To break down an object into electric charges and reconstitute it at some distant place would be a self-defeating operation . It could have no actual value . To transmit a hundred and fifty pounds of electric energy--the weight of a man converted into current--would require the mightiest of bus-bars for a conductor , and months of time if it was not to burn out from overload . The actual transmission of mass as electric energy would be absurd . But if an object could simply be transposed from one place to another; if it could be translated from place to place; if it could undergo substitution of surroundings . . . . That would be a different matter! Transposition would be instantaneous . Translation would require no time . Substitution of position--a man who was here this instant would be there the next--would have no temporal aspect . Such a development would make anything possible . A ship might undertake a voyage to last a century . If a matter-transposer were a part of it , it could be supplied with fuel and air and foodstuffs on its voyage . Its crew could be relieved and exchanged whenever it was desired . And when it made a planet-fall a hundred years and more from home , why , home would still be just around the transposer . With matter-transposition an interstellar civilization could arise and thrive , even though limited to the speed of light for its ships . But a culture spread over hundreds of light-years would be unthinkable without something permitting instant communication between its parts .  All right! said Holmes doggedly . Call them transposers! This fortress had to be supplied . Weve found no sign that ships were used to supply it . It needed to have its air renewed and refreshed . Weve found no sign of anything but emergency stores of air in case some unknown air-supply system failed . Whats the matter with looking for a matter-transposer ?  Burke said , In a way , a telephone system transposes sound-waves from one place to another . Sound-waves arent carried along wires . Theyre here , and then suddenly theyre there . But there has to be a sending and receiving station at each end . When the fortress here was cut off from home it could be that its supply-system broke down .  Its air-system didnt , said Holmes . It hadnt used up its emergency air-supply . Were breathing it!  Anyhow we could try to find even a broken-down transposer , said Sandy .  You try , said Burke . Kellers been looking for something for me in the cubes . Ill stay here and help him look .  Sandy examined the weapon hed given her .  Pam says shes smelled fresh air , down below where there cant be any . Mr . Keller thought he saw movements in the inside vision-plates , where there cant be any . I still believe I saw something alive in the gravity-machine room , where such a thing is impossible . Were going to look , Pam and I .  Holmes lumbered to his feet .  Ill come , too . And Ill guarantee to defend you against anything that has survived the ten thousand years or so that this place was without air . My heads tired , after all those cubes .  He led the way . Burke watched as the two girls followed him and closed the door behind them .  What have you found , Keller ?  A cube about globes , said Keller . Very interesting .  Nothing on communication with base ?  Keller shook his head .  Burke said evenly , I figured out three chances for us--all slim ones . The first was to find the garrison when the radio summons didnt and get it or its descendants to help . I found the garrison--on Earth . No help there . The second chance was finding the civilization that had built this fortress . It looks like its collapsed . Theres been time for a new civilization to get started , but its run away . The third chance is the slimmest of all . Its hooking together something to fight with .  Keller reached out over the array of cubes that had been experienced by Holmes and himself while using the helmets from the cube-library . One cube had been set aside . Keller put it in place on the extra helmet and handed it to Burke .  Try it , said Keller .  Burke put the helmet on his head .         *       *       *       *       *  He was in this same instrument-room , but he wore a uniform and he sat at an instrument-board . He knew that there were drone service-boats perhaps ten thousand miles out , perhaps a hundred . Theyd been fitted out to make a mock attack on the fortress . Counter-tactics men devised them . There was reason for worry . Three times , now , drones pretending to be Enemy ships had dodged past the screen of globes set out to prevent just such an evasion . Once , one of the drones had gloatingly touched the stone of the fortress outer surface . This was triumph for the counter-tactics crew , but it was proof that an Enemy ship could have wiped out the fortress and all its garrison a hundred times over .  Burke sweated . There was a speck with a yellow ring about it . It was a globe , poised and ready to dart in any conceivable direction if an Enemy detection-device ranged it . The globes did not go seeking an Enemy . They placed themselves where they would be sought . They set themselves up as targets . But when a radar-pulse touched them , they flung themselves at its source , their reflex chooser-circuits pouring incredible power into a beam of the same characteristics as the radar-touch . That beam , of course , paralyzed or burned out the Enemy device necessarily tuned to it . And the globes plunged at the thing which had found them . They accelerated at a hundred and sixty gravities and mere high explosive would be wasted if they carried it . Nothing could stand their impact . Nothing!  But in drills three drones had dodged them . The counter-tactics men understood the drones , of course , as it was hoped the Enemy did not . But it should not be possible to get to the fortress! If the fortress was vulnerable , so was the Empire . If the Empire was vulnerable , the Enemy would wreck its worlds , blast its cities , exterminate its population and only foulness would remain in the Galaxy .  On the monitor-board a light flashed . A line of green light darted across the screen . It was the path of a globe hurtling toward something that had touched it with a radar-frequency signal . The acceleration of the globe was breathtaking . It seemed to explode toward its target .  But this globe hit nothing . It went on and on . . . . A second globe sprang . It also struck nothing . It went away to illimitable emptiness . Its path exactly crossed that of the first . A third and fourth and fifth . . . . Each one flung itself ferociously at the source of some trickle of radiation . Their trails crossed at exactly the same spot . But there was nothing there . . . .  Burke suddenly flung up a row of switches , inactivating the remaining globes under his control . Five had flung themselves away , darting at something which radiated but did not exist . Something which was not solid . Which was not a drone ship impersonating an Enemy . Theyd attacked an illusion . . . .  At the control-board . Burke clenched his fist and struck angrily at the flat surface before him . An illusion! Of course!  Cunningly , he made adjustments . He had five globes left . He chose one and changed the setting of its reflex chooser-circuit . It would ignore radar frequencies now . It would pick up only stray radiation--induction frequencies from a drone ship with its drive on .  The globes light flashed . A train of green fire appeared . A burst of flame . A hit! The drone was destroyed . He swiftly changed the setting of the reflex circuits of the rest . Two! Three! Three drones blasted in twice as many seconds .  He mopped his forehead . This was only a drill , but when the Enemy came it would be the solution of such problems that would determine the survival of the fortress and the destruction of the Enemy .  He reported his success crisply .         *       *       *       *       *  Burke took off the helmet .  Keller said mildly , What did he do ?  Burke considered .  The drone , faking to be an enemy , had dumped something out into space . Metal powder , perhaps . It made a cloud in emptiness . Then the drone drew off and threw a radar-beam on the cloud of metal particles . The beam bounced in all directions . When a globe picked it up , it shot for the phony metal-powder target . It went right through and off into space . Other globes fell for the same trick . When they were all gone , the drones could have come right up to the fort .  He was almost interested . Hed felt , at least , the sweating earnestness of an unknown member of this garrison , dead some thousands of years , as he tried to make a good showing in a battle drill .  So he changed the reflex circuits , Burke added . He stopped his globes from homing on radar frequencies . He made them home on frequencies that wouldnt bounce . Then he said in surprise , But they didnt hit , at that! The drones blew up before the globes got to them! They were exploding from the burning-out of all their equipment before the globes got there!  Keller nodded . He said sorrowfully , So clever , our ancestors . But not clever enough!  Of our chances , said Burke , or what I think are chances , the least promising seems to be the idea of trying to hook something together to fight with . He considered , and then smiled very faintly . You saw movements you couldnt identify in the vision-plates ? Sandy says she saw something alive . I wonder if something besides us answered the space-call and got into the fortress by a different way , and has been hiding out , afraid of us .  Keller shook his head .  I dont believe it either , admitted Burke . It seems crazy . But it might be true . It might . Im scraping the bottom of the barrel for solutions to our problem .  Keller shook his head again . Burke shrugged and went out of the instrument-room . He went down the stairs and the first long corridor , and past the long rows of emplacements in which were set the hunkering metal monsters hed cube-dreamed of using , but which would be of no conceivable use against speeding , whirling , artificial-gravity fields with the pull and the mass of suns .  He reached the last long gallery on which the ship-lock opened . He saw the broad white ribbon of many strands of light , reaching away seemingly without limit . And he saw a tiny figure running toward him . It was Sandy . She staggered as she ran . She had already run past endurance , but she kept desperately on . Burke broke into a run himself .  When he met her , she gasped , Pam! She--vanished--down below! We were--looking , and Pam cried out . We ran to her . Gone! And we--heard noises! Noises! Holmes is searching now . She--screamed , Joe!  Burke swung her behind him .  Tell Keller , he commanded harshly . Youve got that hand-weapon ? Hold on to it! Bring Keller! Well all search! Hurry!  He broke into a dead run .  It might have seemed ironic that he should rush to help Sandys sister in whatever disaster had befallen her when they were facing the end of the whole solar system . In cold blood , it couldnt be considered to matter . But Burke ran .  He panted when he plunged down the ramp to the lower portions of the asteroid . He reached the huge cavern in which the motionless power-generator towered storeys high toward a light-laced ceiling .  Holmes! he shouted , and ran on . Holmes!  Hed been no farther than this , before , but he went on into tunnels with only double lines of light-tubes overhead , and he shouted and heard his own voice reverberating in a manner which seemed pure mockery . But as he ran he continued to shout .  And presently Holmes shouted in return . There was a process of untangling innumerable echoes , and ultimately they met . Holmes was deathly white . He carried something unbelievable in his hands .  Here! he growled . I found this . I cornered it . I killed it! What is it ? Did things like this catch Pam ?  Only a man beside himself could have asked such a question . Holmes carried the corpse of a bird with mottled curly feathers . Hed wrung its neck . He suddenly flung it aside .  Wheres Pam ? he demanded fiercely . What the hells happened to her ? Ill kill anything in creation thats tried to hurt her!  Burke snapped questions . Inane ones . Where had Pam been last ? Where were Holmes and Sandy when they missed her ? When she cried out ?  Holmes tried to show him . But this part of the asteroid was a maze of corridors with uncountable doorways opening into innumerable compartments . Some of these compartments were not wholly empty , but neither Burke nor Holmes bothered to examine machine-parts or stacks of cases that would crumble to dust at a touch . They searched like crazy men , calling to Pam .  Keller and Sandy arrived . Theyd passed the corpse of the bird Holmes had killed , and Keller was strangely white-faced . Sandy panted , Did you find her ? Have you found any sign ?  But she knew the answer . They hadnt found Pam . Holmes was haggard , desperate , filled with a murderous fury against whatever unnameable thing had taken Pam away .  Here! snapped Burke . Lets get some system into this! Heres the case with the message-cube . Its our marker . We start from here! Ill follow this cross corridor and the next one . You three take the next three corridors going parallel . One each! Look in every doorway . When we reach the next cross-corridor well compare notes and make another marker .  He went along the way hed chosen , looking in every door . Cryptic masses of metal in one compartment . A heap of dust in another . Empty . Empty . A pile of metal furniture . Another empty . Still another .  Holmes appeared , his hands clenching and unclenching . Sandy turned up , struggling for self-control .  Wheres Keller ?  I heard him call out , said Sandy breathlessly . I thought hed found something and I hurried--  He did not come . They shouted . They searched . Keller had disappeared . They found the mark theyd started from and retraced their steps . Burke heard Holmes swear startledly , but there were so many echoes he could not catch words .  Sandy met Burke . Holmes did not . He did not answer shouts . He was gone .  We stay together , said Burke in an icy voice . Weve both got hand-weapons . Keep yours ready to fire . Ive got mine . Whatever out of hell is loose in this place , well kill it or it will kill us , and then--  He did not finish . They stayed close together , with Burke in the lead .  Well look in each doorway , he insisted . Keep that pistol ready . Dont shoot the others if you see them , but shoot anything else!  Y-yes , said Sandy . She swallowed .  It was nerve-racking . Burke regarded each doorway as a possible ambush . He investigated each one first , making sure that the compartment inside it was wholly empty . There was one extra-large archway to an extra-large compartment , halfway between their starting point and the next cross-corridor . It was obviously empty , though there was a large metal plate on the floor . But it was lighted . Nothing could lurk in there .  Burke inspected the compartment beyond , and the one beyond that .  He thought he heard Sandy gasp . He whirled , gun ready .  Sandy was gone .     Chapter 10   The star Sol was as bright as Sirius , but no brighter because it was nearly half a light-year away and of course could not compare in intrinsic brightness with that farther giant sun . The Milky Way glowed coldly . All the stars shone without any wavering in their light , from the brightest to the faintest tinted dot . The universe was round . There were stars above and below and before and behind and to the right and left . There was nothing which was solid , and nothing which was opaque . There were only infinitely remote , unwinking motes of light , but there were thousands of millions of them . Everywhere there were infinitesimal shinings of red and blue and yellow and green; of all the colors that could be imagined . Yet all the starlight from all the cosmos added up to no more than darkness . The whitest of objects would not shine except faintly , dimly , feebly . There was no warmth . This was deep space , frigid beyond imagining; desolate beyond thinking; empty . It was nothingness spread out in the light of many stars .  In such cold and darkness it would seem that nothing could be , and there was nothing to be seen . But now and again a pattern of stars quivered a little . It contracted a trace and then returned to its original appearance . The disturbance of the star-patterns moved , as a disturbance , in vast curved courses . They were like isolated ripplings in space .  There seemed no cause for these ripplings . But there were powerful gravitational fields in the void , so powerful as to warp space and bend the starlight passing through them . These gravity-fields moved with an incredible speed . There were ten of them , circling in a complex pattern which was spread out as an invisible unit which moved faster than the light their space-twisting violence distorted .  They seemed absolutely undetectable , because even such minute light-ripplings as they made were left behind them . The ten ships which created these monstrous force-fields were unbelievably small . They were no larger than cargo ships on the oceans of one planet in the solar system toward which they sped . They were less than dust particles in infinity . They would travel for only a few more days , now , and then would flash through the solar system which was their target . They should reach its outermost planet--four light-hours away--and within eight minutes more swing mockingly past and through the inner worlds and the sun . They would cross the plane of the ecliptic at nearly a right angle , and they should leave the planets and the yellow star Sol in flaming self-destruction behind them . Then they would flee onward , faster than the chaos they created could follow .  The living creatures on the world to be destroyed would have no warning . One instant everything would be as it had always been . The next , the ground would rise and froth out flames , and more than two thousand million human beings would hardly know that anything had occurred before they were destroyed .  There was no purpose to be served by notifying the world that it was to die . The rulers of the nations had decided that it was kinder to let men and women look at each other and rejoice , thinking they had all their lives before them . It was kinder that children should be let play valorously , and babies wail and instantly be tended . It was better for humanity to move unknowing under blue and sunshine-filled skies than that they should gaze despairingly up at white clouds , or in still deeper horror at the shining night stars from which devastation would presently come .  In the one place where there was foreknowledge , no attention at all was paid to the coming doom . Burke went raging about brightly lighted corridors , shouting horrible things . He cried out to Sandy to answer him , and defied whatever might have seized her to dare to face him . He challenged the cold stone walls . He raged up and down the gallery in which she had vanished , and feverishly explored beyond it , and returned to the place where she had disappeared , and pounded on solid rock to see if there could be some secret doorway through which she had been abducted . It seemed that his heart must stop for pure anguish . He knew such an agony of frustration as he had never known before .  Presently method developed in his searching . Whatever had happened , it must have been close to the tall archway with the large metal plate in its floor and the brilliant lights overhead . Sandy could not have been more than twenty feet from him when she was seized . When he heard her gasp , he was at this spot . Exactly this spot . Hed whirled , and she was gone . She could not have been farther than the door beyond the archway , or else the one facing it . He went into the most probable one . It was a perfectly commonplace storage-room . Hed seen hundreds of them . It was empty . He examined it with a desperate intentness . His hands shook . His whole body was taut . He moved jerkily .  Nothing . He crossed the corridor and examined the room opposite . There was a bit of dust in one corner . He bent stiffly and fingered it . Nothing . He came out , and there was the tall archway , brightly lighted . The other compartments had no light-tubes . Being for storage only , they would not need to be lighted except to be filled and emptied of whatever they should contain . But the archway was very brilliantly lighted .  He went into it , his hand-weapon shaking with the tension in him . There was the metal plate on the floor . It was large--yards in extent . He began a circuit of the walls . Halfway around , he realized that the walls were masonry . Not native rock , like every other place in the fortress . This wall had been made! He stared about . On the opposite wall there was a small thing with a handle on it , to be moved up or down . It was a round metal disk with a handle , set in the masonry .  He flung himself across the room to examine it . He was filled with terror for Sandy , which would turn into more-than-murderous fury if he found her harmed . The metal floor-plate lay between . He stepped obliviously on the plate . . . .  The universe dissolved around him . The brightly lit masonry wall became vague and misty . Simultaneously quite other things appeared mistily , then solidified .  He was abruptly in the open air , with a collapsed and ruined structure about and behind him . This was not emptiness , but the surface of a world . Over his head there was a sunset sky . Before him there was grass , and beyond that a horizon , and to his left there was collapsed stonework and far off ahead there was a hill which he knew was not a natural hill at all . There was a moon in the sky , a half-moon with markings that he remembered . There were trees , too , and they were trees with long , ribbony leaves such as never grew on Earth .  He stood frozen for long instants , and a second , smaller moon came up rapidly over the horizon and traveled swiftly across the sky . It was jagged and irregular in shape .  Then flutings came from somewhere to his rear . They were utterly familiar sounds . They had distinctive pitch , which varied from one to another , and they were of different durations like half-notes and quarter-notes in music . And they had a plaintive quality which could have been termed elfin .  All this was so completely known to him that it should have been shocking , but he was in such an agony of fear for Sandy that he could not react to it . His terror for her was breath-stopping . He held his weapon ready in his hand . He tried to call her name , but he could not speak .  The long , ribbony leaves of the trees waved to and fro in a gentle breeze . And then Burke saw a figure running behind the swaying foliage . He knew who it was . The relief was almost greater pain than his terror had been . It was such an emotion as Burke had experienced only feebly , even in his recurrent dream . He gave a great shout and bounded forward to meet Sandy , crying out again as he ran .  Then he had his arms about her , and she clung to him with that remarkable ability women have to adapt themselves to circumstances theyve been hoping for , even when they come unexpectedly . He kissed her feverishly , panting incoherent things about the fear hed felt , holding her fast .  Presently somebody tugged at his elbow . It was Holmes . He said drily , I know how you feel , Burke . I acted the same way just now . But there are things to be looked into . Itll be dark soon and we dont know how long night lasts here . Have you a match ?  Pam regarded the two of them with a peculiar glint of humor in her eyes . Keller was there too , still shaken by an experience which for him had no emotional catharsis attached .  Burke partly released Sandy and fumbled for his cigarette lighter . He felt singularly foolish , but Sandy showed no trace of embarrassment .  There was a matter-transposer , she said , and we found it , and we all came through it .  Keller said awkwardly , I turned on the communicator to base . It must have been a matter-transposer . I thought , in the instrument-room , that it was only a communicator .  Holmes moved away . He came back bearing broken sticks , which were limbs fallen from untended trees . He piled them and went back for more . In minutes he had a tiny fire and a big pile of branches to keep it up , but he went back for still more .  It works both ways , observed Sandy . Or something does! There must be another metal plate here to go to the fortress . That huge , crazy bird I saw in the gravity-generator room must have come from here . He probably stepped on the plate because it was brightly lighted and--  Youve got your pistol ? demanded Burke .  The sunset sky was darkening . The larger , seemingly stationary moon floated ever-so-slightly nearer to the zenith . The small and jagged moon had gone on out of sight .  I have , said Sandy . Pam gave hers to Holmes . But thats all right . There wont be savages . Over there , beyond the trees , theres a metal railing , impossibly old and corroded . But no savage would leave metal alone . I dont think theres anybody here but us .  Burke stared at something far away that looked like a hill .  Theres a building , or the ruins of one . No lights . No smoke . Savages would occupy it . Were alone , all right! I wonder where ? We could be anywhere within a hundred or five hundred light-years from Earth .  Then , said Sandy comfortably , we should be safe from the Enemy .  No , said Burke . If the Enemy has an unbeatable weapon , destroying one solar system wont be enough . Theyll smash every one that humanity ever used . Which includes this one . Theyll be here eventually . Not at once , but later . Theyll come!  He looked at the small fire . There were curious , familiar fragrances in the air . Over to the west the sun sank in a completely orthodox glory of red and gold . The larger moon swam serenely in the sky .  Im afraid , said Pam , that we wont eat tonight unless we can get back to the fortress and the ship . I guess were farther from our dinners than most people ever get . Did you say five hundred light-years ?  Ask Keller , grunted Burke . Ive got to think .  Far off in the new night there was something like a birdsong , though it might come from anything at all . Much nearer there were peculiarly maternal clucking noises . They sounded as if they might come from a bird with a caricature of a bill and stumpy , useless wings . There was a baying noise , very far away indeed , and Burke remembered that the ancestry of dogs on Earth was as much a mystery as the first appearance of mankind . There were no wild ancestors of either race . Perhaps there had been dogs with the garrison of the fortress , which might be five hundred light-years away , in one sense , but could not be more than a few yards , in another .  Holmes squatted by the fire and built it up to brightness . Keller came back to the circle of flickering light . His forehead was creased .  The constellations , he said unhappily . Theyre gone!  Which would mean , Burke told him absently , that were more than forty light-years from home . Theyd all be changed at that distance .  Holmes seated himself beside Pam . They had reached an obvious understanding . Burkes eyes wandered in their direction . Holmes began to speak in a low tone , and Pam smiled at him . Burke jerked his head to stare at Sandy .  I think I forgot something . Should I ask you again to marry me ? Or do I take it for granted that you will ?--if we live through this ? He didnt wait for her answer . Things have changed , Sandy , he said gruffly . Mostly me . Ive gotten rid of an obsession and acquired a fixation--on you .  There , said Sandy warmly , there speaks my Joseph! Yes , Ill marry you . And we will live through this! Youll figure something out , Joe . I dont know how , but you will!  Yes-s-s , said Burke slowly . Somehow I feel that Ive got something tucked away in my head that should apply . I need to get it out and look it over . I dont know what it is or where it came from , but Ive got something . . . .  He stared into the fire , Sandy nestled confidently against him . She put her hand in his . The wind blew warm and softly through the trees . Presently Holmes replenished the fire .  Burke looked up with a start as Sandy said , Ive thought of something , Joe! Do you remember that dream of yours ? I know what it was!  What ?  It came from a black cube , said Sandy , which was a cube that somebody from the garrison took to Earth . And what kind of cube would they take ? They wouldnt take drill-instruction cubes! They wouldnt take cubes telling them how to service the weapons or operate the globes or whatever else the fortress has! Do you know what theyd take ?  He shook his head .  Novels , said Sandy . Fiction stories . Adventure tales . To--experience on long winter evenings or even asleep by a campfire . They were fighting men , Joe , those ancestors of ours . They wouldnt care about science , but theyd like a good , lusty love story or a mystery or whatever was the equivalent of a Western twenty thousand years ago . You got hold of a page in a love story , Joe!  Probably , he growled . But if I ever dream it again Ill know whos behind those waving branches . You . Then , surprised , he said , There were flutings when I came through the matter-transposer . Theyve stopped .  They sounded when I came through , too . And when Pam and Holmes and Keller came . Do you know what I think they are ? Sandy smiled up at him . You have arrived on the planet Sanda . Surface-travel facilities to the left , banking service and baggage to the right , tourist accommodations and information straight ahead . We may never know , Joe , but it could be that!  He made an inarticulate sound and stared at the fire again . She fell silent . Soon Keller was dozing . Holmes strode away and came back dragging leafy branches . He made a crude lean-to for Pam , to reflect back the warmth of the fire upon her . She curled up , smiled at him , and went confidently to sleep . A long time later Sandy found herself yawning . She slipped her fingers from Burkes hand and settled down beside Pam .  Burke seemed not to notice . He was busy . He thought very carefully , running through the information hed received from the black cubes . He carefully refrained from thinking of the desperate necessity for a solution to the problem of the Enemy . If it was to be solved , it would be by a mind working without strain , just as a word that eludes the memory is best recalled when one no longer struggles to remember it .  Twice during the darkness Holmes regarded the blackness about them with suspicion , his hand on the small weapon Pam had passed to him . But nothing happened . There were sounds like bird calls , and songs like those of insects , and wind in the trees . But there was nothing else .  When gray first showed in the east , Burke shook himself . The jagged small moon rose hurriedly and floated across the sky .  Holmes , said Burke reflectively . I think Ive got what we want . You know how artificial gravitys made , what the circuit is like .  To anybody but Holmes and Keller , the comment would have seemed idiotic . It would have seemed insane even to them , not too long before . But Holmes nodded .  Yes . Of course . Why ?  Theres a chooser-circuit in the globes , said Burke carefully , that picks up radiation from an Enemy ship , and multiplies it enormously and beams it back . The circuit that made the radiation to begin with has to be resonant to it , as the globe burns it out while dashing down its own beam .  Naturally , said Holmes . What about it ?  The point is , said Burke , that one could treat a suddenly increasing gravity-field as radiation . Not a stationary one , of course . But one that increased , fast . Like the gravity-fields of the Enemy ships , moving faster than light toward our sun .  Hmmmm , said Holmes . Yes . That could be done . But hitting something thats traveling faster than light--  Theyre traveling in a straight line , said Burke , except for orbiting around each other every few hours . Theres no faster-than-light angular velocity; just straight-line velocity . And with the artificial mass theyve got , they couldnt conceivably dodge . If we got some globes tricked up to throw a beam of gravity-field back at the Enemy ships , there might be resonance , and theres a chance that one might hit , too .  Holmes considered .  It might take half an hour to change the circuit , he observed . Maybe less . Thered be no way in the world to test them . But they might work . Wed want a lot of them on the job , though , to give the idea a fair chance .  Burke stood up , creaking a little from long immobility .  Lets hunt for the way back to the fortress , he said . There is a way . At least two crazy birds were marching around in the fortress corridors .  Holmes nodded again . They began a search . Matter transposed from the fortress--specifically , the five of them--came out in a nearly three-walled alcove in the side of what had once been a magnificent building . Now it was filled with the trunks and stalks of trees and vines which grew out of every window-opening . There were other , similar alcoves , as if other matter-transposers to other outposts or other worlds had been centered here . They were looking for one that a plump , ridiculous bird might blunder into among the broken stones .  They found a metal plate partly arched-over by fallen stones in the very next alcove . They hauled at the tumbled rock . Presently the way was clear .  Come along! called Burke . Weve got a job to do! You girls want to fix breakfast and we want to get to work . Weve a few hundred light-years to cross before we can have our coffee .  Somehow he felt no doubt whatever . The five of them walked onto the corroded metal plate together , and the sky faded and ghosts of tube-lights appeared and became brilliant , and they stepped off the plate into a corridor one section removed from the sending-transposer which had translated them all , successively , to wherever they had been .  And everything proceeded matter-of-factly . The three men went to the room where metal globes by hundreds waited for the defenders of the fortress to make use of them . They were completely practical , those globes . There were even small footholds sunk into their curving sides so a man could climb to their tops and inspect or change the apparatus within .  On the way , Burke explained to Keller . The globes were designed to be targets , and targets they would remain . Theyd be set out in the path of the coming Enemy ships , which could not vary their courses . Their circuits would be changed to treat the suddenly increasing gravitational fields as radiation , so that they would first project back a monstrous field of the same energy , and then dive down it to presumed collision with the ships . There was a distinct possibility that if enough globes could be gotten out in space , that at the least they might hit one enemy ship and so wreck the closely orbited grouping . From that reasonable first possibility , the chances grew slimmer , but the results to be hoped for increased .  Keller nodded , brightly . Hed used the reading helmets more than anybody else . He understood . Moreover , his mind was trained to work in just this field .  When they reached the room of the many spheres he gestured for Burke and Holmes to wait . He climbed the footholds of one globe , deftly removed its top , and looked inside . The conductors were three-inch bars of pure silver . He reached in and did this and that . He climbed down and motioned for Burke and Holmes to look .  It took them long seconds to realize what hed done . But with his knowledge of what could be done , once he was told what was needed , hed made exactly three new contacts and the globe was transformed to Burkes new specifications .  Instead of days required to modify the circuits , the three of them had a hundred of the huge round weapons changed over within an hour . Then Keller went up to the instrument-room and painstakingly studied the launching system . He began the launchings while Holmes and Burke completed the change-over task . They joined him in the instrument-room when the last of the metal spheres rose a foot from the stony floor of the magazine and went lurching unsteadily over to the breech of the launching-tube they hadnt noticed before .  Three hundred , said Keller in a pleased tone , later . All going out at full acceleration to meet the Enemy . And there are six observer-globes in the lot .  Observers , said Burke grimly . Thats right . We cant observe anything because the information would come back at the speed of light . But if we lose , the Enemy will arrive before we can know weve lost .  Keller shook his head reproachfully .  Oh , no! Oh , no! I just understood . There are transposers of electric energy , too . Very tiny . In the observers .  Burke stared . But it was only logical . If matter could be transposed instead of transmitted between distant places , assuredly miniature energy-transposers were not impossible . The energy would no more travel than transposed matter would move . It would be transposed . The fortress would see what the observer-globes saw , at the instant they saw it , no matter what the distance!  Keller glanced at the ten-foot disk with its many small lights and the writhing bright-red sparks which were the Enemy gravity-ships . There was something like a scale of distances understood , now . The red sparks had been not far from the disks edge when the first space call went out to Earth . They were nearer the center when the spaceship arrived here . They were very , very near the center now .  Five days , said Burke in a hard voice . Where will the globes meet them ?  Theyre using full acceleration , Keller reminded him gently . One hundred sixty gravities .  A mile a second acceleration , said Burke . Somehow he was not astonished . In an hour , thirty-six hundred miles per second . In ten hours , thirty-six thousand miles per second . If they hit at that speed , theyd smash a moon! Theyll cover half a billion miles in ten hours--but thats not enough! Its only a fifth of the way to Pluto! They wont be halfway to Uranus!  Theyll have fifty-six hours , said Keller . The need to communicate clearly made him almost articulate . Not on the plane of the ecliptic . Their course is along the line of the suns axis . Meeting , seven times Plutos distance . Twenty billion miles . Two days and a half . If they miss well know .  Holmes growled , If they miss , what then ?  I stay here , said Keller , mildly . I wont outlive everybody . Id be lonely . Then he gave a quick , embarrassed smile . Breakfast must be ready . We can do nothing but wait .  But waiting was not easy .  On the first day there came a flood of messages from Earth . Why had they cut off communication ? Answer! Answer! Answer! What could be done about the Enemy ships ? What could be done to save lives ? If a few spaceships could be completed and take off before the solar system shattered , would the asteroid be shattered too ? Could a few dozen survivors of Earth hope to make their way to the asteroid and survive there ? Should the coming doom be revealed to the world ?  The last question showed that the authorities of Earth were rattled . It was not a matter for Burke or Keller or Holmes to decide . They transmitted , in careful code , an exact description of the sending of the globes to try to intercept the Enemy gravity-ships . But it was not possible for people with no experiential knowledge of artificial gravity to believe that anything so massive as a sun could be destroyed by hurling a mere ten-foot missile at it!  Then there came a sudden revulsion of feeling on Earth . The truth was too horrible to believe , so it was resolved not to believe it . And therefore prominent persons broke into public print , denouncing Burke for having predicted the end of the world from his safe refuge in Asteroid M-387 . They explained elaborately how he must be not only wrong but maliciously wrong .  But these denunciations were the first knowledge the public had possessed of the thing denounced . Some people instantly panicked because some people infallibly believe the worst , at all times . Some shared the indignation of the eminent characters who denounced Burke . Some were bewildered and many unstable persons vehemently urged everybody to do this or that in order to be saved . Get-rich-artists sold tickets in non-existent spacecraft they claimed had secretly been built in anticipation of the disaster . They would accept only paper currency in small bills . What value paper money would have after the destruction of Earth was not explained , but people paid it . Astronomers swore quite truthfully that no telescope gave any sign of the alleged sun-sized masses en route to destroy Earth . Government officials heroically lied in their throats to reassure the populace because , after all , one didnt want the half-civilized part of educated nations to run mad during Earths probable last few days .  And Burke and the others looked at the images sent back by the observer-globes traveling with the rest . The cosmos looked to the observer-globes just about the way it did from the fortress . There were innumerable specks of light of innumerable tints and colors . There was darkness . There was cold . And there was emptiness . The globe-fleet drove on away from the sun and from that flat plane near which all the planets revolve . Every second the spheres pace increased by one mile per second . Ten hours after Keller released them , they had covered five hundred eighty-eight thousand thousand miles and the sun still showed as a perceptible disk . Twenty hours out , the globes had traveled two billion six hundred million miles and the sun was the brightest star the observers could note . Thirty hours out , and the squadron of ten-foot globes had traveled five billion eight hundred thirty-odd million miles and the sun was no longer an outstanding figure in the universe .  Houses looked fine-drawn , now , and Pam was fidgety . Keller appeared to be wholly normal . And Sandy was conspicuously calm .  Ill be glad when this is over , she said at dinner in the ship in the lock-tunnel . I dont think any of you realize what this fortress and the matter-transposer and the planet it took us to--I dont believe any of you realize what such things can mean to people .  Burke waited . She smiled at him and said briskly , Theres a vacant planet for people to move to . People occupied it once . They can do it again . Once it had a terrific civilization . This fortress was just one of its outposts . There were plenty of other forts and other planets , and the people had sciences away ahead of ours . And all those worlds , tamed and ready , are waiting right now for us to come and use them .  Holmes said , Yes ? What happened to the people who lived on them ?  If you ask me , said Sandy confidentially , I think they went the way of Greece and Rome . I think they got so civilized that they got soft . They built forts instead of fighting fleets . They stopped thinking of conquests and begrudged even thinking of defenses , though they had to , after a fashion . But they thought of things like the Rhine forts of the Romans , and Hadrians Wall . Like the Great Wall of China , and the Maginot Line in France . When men build forts and dont build fighting fleets , theyre on the way down .  Burke said nothing . Holmes waited for more .  Its my belief , said Sandy , that many , many centuries ago the people who built this fort sent a spaceship off somewhere with a matter-transposer on board . They replaced its crew while it traveled on and on , and they gave it supplies , and refreshed its air , and finally it arrived somewhere at the other side of the Galaxy . And then the people here set up a matter-transposer and they all moved through it to the new , peaceful , lovely world theyd found . All except the garrison that was left behind . The Enemy would never find them there! And I think they smashed the matter-transposer that might have let the Enemy follow them--or the garrison of this fort , for that matter! And I think that away beyond the Milky Way there are the descendents of those people . Theyre soft , and pretty , and useless , and theyve likely let their knowledge die , and there probably arent very many of them left . And I think its good riddance!  Pam said , If we beat the Enemy therell be no excuse for wars on Earth . Therell be worlds enough to take all the surplus population anybody can imagine . Therell be riches for everybody . Joe , what do you think the human race will do for you if , on top of finding new worlds for everybody , you cap it by defeating the Enemy with the globes ?  I think , said Burke , that most people will dislike me very much . Ill be in the history books , but Ill be in small print . People who can realize theyre obligated will resent it , and those who cant will think I got famous in a disreputable fashion . In fact , if we go back to Earth , Ill probably have to fight to keep from going bankrupt . If I manage to get enough money for a living , itll be by having somebody ghost-write a book for me about our journey here .  Keller interrupted mildly , Its nearly time . We should watch .  Holmes stood up jerkily . Pam and Sandy rose almost reluctantly .  They went out of the ship and through the metal door with rounded corners . They went along the long corridor with the seeming river of light-tubes in its ceiling . They passed the doorway of the great room which had held the globes . It looked singularly empty , now .  On the next level they passed the mess-halls and bunk-rooms , and on the third the batteries of grisly weapons which could hurl enormous charges of electricity at a chosen target , if the target could be ranged . They went on up into the instrument-room by the final flight of stairs .  They settled down there . That is , they did not leave . But far too much depended on the next hour or less for anybody to be truly still in either mind or body . Holmes paced jerkily back and forth , his eyes on the vision-screens that now relayed what the observer-globes with the globe-fleet saw .  For a long time they gazed at the emptiness of deepest space . The picture was of an all-encompassing wall of tiny flecks of light . They did not move . They did not change . They did not waver . The observer-globes reported from nothingness , and they reported nothing .  Except one item . There were fewer red specks of light and more blue ones . There were some which were distinctly violet . The globes had attained a velocity so close to the speed of light that no available added power could have pushed them the last fraction of one per cent faster . But they had no monstrous mass-fields to change the constants of space and let them travel more swiftly . The Enemy ships did . But there was no sign of them . There could be none except on such a detector as the instrument-room had in its ten-foot transparent disk .  Time passed , and passed . And passed . Finally , Burke broke the silence .  Of course the globes dont have to make direct hits . We hope! If they multiply the gravity-field that hits them and shoot it back hard enough , it ought to burn out the gravity-generators in the ships .  There was no answer . Pam watched the screens and bit nervously at her nails .  Seconds went by . Minutes . Tens of minutes . . . .  I fear , said Keller with some difficulty , that something is wrong . Perhaps I erred in adjusting the globes--  If he had made a mistake , of course , the globe-fleet would be useless . It wouldnt stop the Enemy . It wouldnt do anything , and in a very short time the sun and all its planets would erupt with insensate violence , and all the solar system would shatter itself to burning bits--and the Enemy fleet would be speeding away faster than exploding matter could possibly follow it .  Then , without warning , a tiny bluish line streaked across one of the screens . A second . A third-fourth-fifth-twentieth-fiftieth--The screens came alive with flashing streaks of blue-green light .  Then something blew . A sphere of violet light appeared on one of the screens . Instantly , it was followed by others with such rapidity that it was impossible to tell which followed which . But there were ten of them .  The silence in the instrument-room was absolute . Burke tried vainly to imagine what had actually happened . The Enemy fleet had been traveling at thirty times the speed of light , which was only possible because of its artificial mass which changed the properties of space to permit it . And then the generators and maintainers of that artificial mass blew out . The ships stopped--so suddenly , so instantly , so absolutely that a millionth part of a second would have been a thousand times longer than the needed interval .  The energy of that enormous speed had to be dissipated . The ships exploded as nothing had ever exploded before . Even a super-nova would not detonate with such violence . The substance of the Enemy ships destroyed itself not merely by degenerating to raw atoms , but by the atoms destroying themselves . And not merely did the atoms fly apart , but the neutrons and protons and electrons of which they were composed ceased to exist . Nothing was left but pure energy--violet light . And it vanished .  Then there was nothing at all . What was left of the globe-fleet went hurtling uselessly onward through space . It would go on and on and on . It would reach the edge of the galaxy and go on , and perhaps in thousands of millions of years some one or two or a dozen of the surviving spheres might penetrate some star-cloud millions of millions of light-years away .  In a pleased voice , Keller said , I think everything is all right now .  And Sandy went all to pieces . She clung to Burke , weeping uncontrollably , holding herself close to him while she sobbed .  On Earth , of course , there was no such eccentric jubilation . It was observed that crawling red sparks in the gravity-field detectors winked out . As hours and days went by , it was noticed that the solar system continued to exist , and that people stayed alive . It became evident that some part of the terror some people had felt was baseless . And naturally there was much resentment against Burke because he had caused so many people so much agitation .  Within two weeks a fleet of small plastic ships hurtled upward from the vicinity of Earths north magnetic pole and presently steadied on course toward the fortress asteroid . Burke was informed severely that he should prepare to receive the scientists they carried . He would be expected to coöperate fully in their investigations .  He grinned when Pam handed him the written sheet .  Its outrageous! snapped Sandy . Its ridiculous! They ought to get down on their knees to you , Joe , to thank you for what youve done!  Burke shook his head .  I dont think Id like that . Neither would you . Well make out , Sandy . Therell be a colony started on that world the matter-transposer links us to . It might be fun living there . What say ?  Sandy grumbled . But she looked at him with soft eyes .  Id rather be mixed up with--what you might call pioneers , said Burke , than people with reputations to defend and announced theories that are going to turn out to be all wrong . The research in this fortress and on that planet will make some red faces , on Earth . And theres another thing .  What ? asked Sandy .  This war weve inherited without doing anything to deserve it , said Burke . In fact , the Enemy . We havent the least idea what theyre like or anything at all about them except that they go off somewhere and spend a few thousand years cooking up something lethal to throw at us . They tired out our ancestors . If theyd only known it , they won the war by default . Our ancestors moved away to let the Enemy have its own way about this part of the galaxy , anyhow . And judging by past performances , the Enemy will just stew somewhere until they think of something more dangerous than artificial sun-masses riding through our solar systems .  Well ? she demanded . Whats to be done about that ?  With the right sort of people around , said Burke meditatively , we could do a little contriving of our own . And we could get a ship ready and think about looking them up and pinning their ears back in their own bailiwick , instead of waiting for them to take pot-shots at us .  Sandy nodded gravely . She was a woman . She hadnt the faintest idea of ever letting Burke take off into space again if she could help it--unless , perhaps , for one occasion when she would show herself off in a veil and a train , gloating .  But it had taken the Enemy a very long time to concoct this last method of attack . When the time came to take the offensive against them , at least a few centuries would have passed . Five or six , anyhow . So Sandy did not protest against an idea that wouldnt result in action for some hundreds of years . Argument about Burkes share in such an enterprise could wait .  So Sandy kissed him .         *       *       *       *       *   . . .if you enjoyed THE WAILING ASTEROID be sure not to miss   TWISTS IN TIME  by Murray Leinster T389 35¢  Here are six strange and startling stories , calculated to entrance science-fiction lovers .

With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs , serene in their assurance of their empire over matter .  It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same .  No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger , or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable .  It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days .  At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars , perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise .  Yet across the gulf of space , minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish , intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic , regarded this earth with envious eyes , and slowly and surely drew their plans against us .  And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment .  The planet Mars , I scarcely need remind the reader , revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140 ,000 ,000 miles , and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world . It must be , if the nebular hypothesis has any truth , older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten , life upon its surface must have begun its course .  The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin .  It has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence .  Yet so vain is man , and so blinded by his vanity , that no writer , up to the very end of the nineteenth century , expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed there far , or indeed at all , beyond its earthly level .  Nor was it generally understood that since Mars is older than our earth , with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter from the sun , it necessarily follows that it is not only more distant from times beginning but nearer its end .  The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed with our neighbour .  Its physical condition is still largely a mystery , but we know now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter .  Its air is much more attenuated than ours , its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface , and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones .  That last stage of exhaustion , which to us is still incredibly remote , has become a present-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars .  The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects , enlarged their powers , and hardened their hearts .  And looking across space with instruments , and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of , they see , at its nearest distance only 35 ,000 ,000 of miles sunward of them , a morning star of hope , our own warmer planet , green with vegetation and grey with water , with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility , with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow , navy-crowded seas .  And we men , the creatures who inhabit this earth , must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us .  The intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence , and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars .  Their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life , but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals .  To carry warfare sunward is , indeed , their only escape from the destruction that , generation after generation , creeps upon them .  And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought , not only upon animals , such as the vanished bison and the dodo , but upon its inferior races .  The Tasmanians , in spite of their human likeness , were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants , in the space of fifty years .  Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit ?  The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing subtlety--their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of ours--and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh perfect unanimity .  Had our instruments permitted it , we might have seen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century .  Men like Schiaparelli watched the red planet--it is odd , by-the-bye , that for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war--but failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so well .  All that time the Martians must have been getting ready .  During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated part of the disk , first at the Lick Observatory , then by Perrotin of Nice , and then by other observers .  English readers heard of it first in the issue of Nature dated August 2 .  I am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun , in the vast pit sunk into their planet , from which their shots were fired at us .  Peculiar markings , as yet unexplained , were seen near the site of that outbreak during the next two oppositions .  The storm burst upon us six years ago now .  As Mars approached opposition , Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon the planet .  It had occurred towards midnight of the twelfth; and the spectroscope , to which he had at once resorted , indicated a mass of flaming gas , chiefly hydrogen , moving with an enormous velocity towards this earth .  This jet of fire had become invisible about a quarter past twelve .  He compared it to a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet , as flaming gases rushed out of a gun .  A singularly appropriate phrase it proved .  Yet the next day there was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the Daily Telegraph , and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest dangers that ever threatened the human race . I might not have heard of the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy , the well-known astronomer , at Ottershaw .  He was immensely excited at the news , and in the excess of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet .  In spite of all that has happened since , I still remember that vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory , the shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner , the steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope , the little slit in the roof--an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it . Ogilvy moved about , invisible but audible .  Looking through the telescope , one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field .  It seemed such a little thing , so bright and small and still , faintly marked with transverse stripes , and slightly flattened from the perfect round .  But so little it was , so silvery warm--a pins-head of light! It was as if it quivered , but really this was the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view .  As I watched , the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to advance and recede , but that was simply that my eye was tired .  Forty millions of miles it was from us--more than forty millions of miles of void .  Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims .  Near it in the field , I remember , were three faint points of light , three telescopic stars infinitely remote , and all around it was the unfathomable darkness of empty space .  You know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night .  In a telescope it seems far profounder .  And invisible to me because it was so remote and small , flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible distance , drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles , came the Thing they were sending us , the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth .  I never dreamed of it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring missile .  That night , too , there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet .  I saw it .  A reddish flash at the edge , the slightest projection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I told Ogilvy and he took my place .  The night was warm and I was thirsty , and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the darkness , to the little table where the siphon stood , while Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us .  That night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth from Mars , just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first one .  I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness , with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes .  I wished I had a light to smoke by , little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I had seen and all that it would presently bring me .  Ogilvy watched till one , and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his house .  Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people , sleeping in peace .  He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars , and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were signalling us .  His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet , or that a huge volcanic explosion was in progress .  He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets .  The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one , he said .  Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after about midnight , and again the night after; and so for ten nights , a flame each night .  Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth has attempted to explain .  It may be the gases of the firing caused the Martians inconvenience .  Dense clouds of smoke or dust , visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey , fluctuating patches , spread through the clearness of the planets atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features .  Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last , and popular notes appeared here , there , and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon Mars .  The seriocomic periodical Punch , I remember , made a happy use of it in the political cartoon .  And , all unsuspected , those missiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward , rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space , hour by hour and day by day , nearer and nearer . It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that , with that swift fate hanging over us , men could go about their petty concerns as they did .  I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days . People in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers .  For my own part , I was much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle , and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed .  One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10 ,000 ,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife .  It was starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her , and pointed out Mars , a bright dot of light creeping zenithward , towards which so many telescopes were pointed .  It was a warm night .  Coming home , a party of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing music .  There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the people went to bed .  From the railway station in the distance came the sound of shunting trains , ringing and rumbling , softened almost into melody by the distance .  My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red , green , and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the sky .  It seemed so safe and tranquil .    CHAPTER TWO  THE FALLING STAR   Then came the night of the first falling star .  It was seen early in the morning , rushing over Winchester eastward , a line of flame high in the atmosphere .  Hundreds must have seen it , and taken it for an ordinary falling star .  Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds .  Denning , our greatest authority on meteorites , stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles .  It seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him .  I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved in those days to look up at the night sky) , I saw nothing of it . Yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space must have fallen while I was sitting there , visible to me had I only looked up as it passed .  Some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound .  I myself heard nothing of that .  Many people in Berkshire , Surrey , and Middlesex must have seen the fall of it , and , at most , have thought that another meteorite had descended . No one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night .  But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy , who had seen the shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common between Horsell , Ottershaw , and Woking , rose early with the idea of finding it .  Find it he did , soon after dawn , and not far from the sand pits .  An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the projectile , and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction over the heath , forming heaps visible a mile and a half away .  The heather was on fire eastward , and a thin blue smoke rose against the dawn .  The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand , amidst the scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its descent .  The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder , caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured incrustation .  It had a diameter of about thirty yards .  He approached the mass , surprised at the size and more so at the shape , since most meteorites are rounded more or less completely .  It was , however , still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach .  A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow .  He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for itself , staring at its strange appearance , astonished chiefly at its unusual shape and colour , and dimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its arrival .  The early morning was wonderfully still , and the sun , just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge , was already warm .  He did not remember hearing any birds that morning , there was certainly no breeze stirring , and the only sounds were the faint movements from within the cindery cylinder .  He was all alone on the common .  Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker , the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite , was falling off the circular edge of the end .  It was dropping off in flakes and raining down upon the sand .  A large piece suddenly came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth .  For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant , and , although the heat was excessive , he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to see the Thing more clearly .  He fancied even then that the cooling of the body might account for this , but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder .  And then he perceived that , very slowly , the circular top of the cylinder was rotating on its body .  It was such a gradual movement that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the circumference .  Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated , until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so .  Then the thing came upon him in a flash .  The cylinder was artificial--hollow--with an end that screwed out! Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!  Good heavens! said Ogilvy .  Theres a man in it--men in it! Half roasted to death!  Trying to escape!  At once , with a quick mental leap , he linked the Thing with the flash upon Mars .  The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn .  But luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands on the still-glowing metal .  At that he stood irresolute for a moment , then turned , scrambled out of the pit , and set off running wildly into Woking .  The time then must have been somewhere about six oclock . He met a waggoner and tried to make him understand , but the tale he told and his appearance were so wild--his hat had fallen off in the pit--that the man simply drove on .  He was equally unsuccessful with the potman who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell Bridge .  The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to shut him into the taproom .  That sobered him a little; and when he saw Henderson , the London journalist , in his garden , he called over the palings and made himself understood .  Henderson , he called , you saw that shooting star last night ?  Well ? said Henderson .  Its out on Horsell Common now .  Good Lord! said Henderson .  Fallen meteorite!  Thats good .  But its something more than a meteorite .  Its a cylinder--an artificial cylinder , man!  And theres something inside .  Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand .  Whats that ? he said .  He was deaf in one ear .  Ogilvy told him all that he had seen .  Henderson was a minute or so taking it in .  Then he dropped his spade , snatched up his jacket , and came out into the road .  The two men hurried back at once to the common , and found the cylinder still lying in the same position .  But now the sounds inside had ceased , and a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder .  Air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin , sizzling sound .  They listened , rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick , and , meeting with no response , they both concluded the man or men inside must be insensible or dead .  Of course the two were quite unable to do anything .  They shouted consolation and promises , and went off back to the town again to get help .  One can imagine them , covered with sand , excited and disordered , running up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows .  Henderson went into the railway station at once , in order to telegraph the news to London .  The newspaper articles had prepared mens minds for the reception of the idea .  By eight oclock a number of boys and unemployed men had already started for the common to see the dead men from Mars .  That was the form the story took .  I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a quarter to nine when I went out to get my Daily Chronicle .  I was naturally startled , and lost no time in going out and across the Ottershaw bridge to the sand pits .    CHAPTER THREE  ON HORSELL COMMON   I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge hole in which the cylinder lay .  I have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk , embedded in the ground .  The turf and gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion .  No doubt its impact had caused a flash of fire .  Henderson and Ogilvy were not there .  I think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present , and had gone away to breakfast at Hendersons house .  There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit , with their feet dangling , and amusing themselves--until I stopped them--by throwing stones at the giant mass .  After I had spoken to them about it , they began playing at touch in and out of the group of bystanders .  Among these were a couple of cyclists , a jobbing gardener I employed sometimes , a girl carrying a baby , Gregg the butcher and his little boy , and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to hang about the railway station .  There was very little talking .  Few of the common people in England had anything but the vaguest astronomical ideas in those days .  Most of them were staring quietly at the big table like end of the cylinder , which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had left it .  I fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate bulk . Some went away while I was there , and other people came .  I clambered into the pit and fancied I heard a faint movement under my feet .  The top had certainly ceased to rotate .  It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of this object was at all evident to me .  At the first glance it was really no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road .  Not so much so , indeed .  It looked like a rusty gas float .  It required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the grey scale of the Thing was no common oxide , that the yellowish-white metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue .  Extra-terrestrial had no meaning for most of the onlookers .  At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come from the planet Mars , but I judged it improbable that it contained any living creature .  I thought the unscrewing might be automatic .  In spite of Ogilvy , I still believed that there were men in Mars .  My mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript , on the difficulties in translation that might arise , whether we should find coins and models in it , and so forth . Yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea .  I felt an impatience to see it opened .  About eleven , as nothing seemed happening , I walked back , full of such thought , to my home in Maybury . But I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract investigations .  In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much .  The early editions of the evening papers had startled London with enormous headlines:    A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS .    REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING ,  and so forth .  In addition , Ogilvys wire to the Astronomical Exchange had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms .  There were half a dozen flies or more from the Woking station standing in the road by the sand pits , a basket-chaise from Chobham , and a rather lordly carriage .  Besides that , there was quite a heap of bicycles .  In addition , a large number of people must have walked , in spite of the heat of the day , from Woking and Chertsey , so that there was altogether quite a considerable crowd--one or two gaily dressed ladies among the others .  It was glaringly hot , not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind , and the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees .  The burning heather had been extinguished , but the level ground towards Ottershaw was blackened as far as one could see , and still giving off vertical streamers of smoke .  An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham Road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green apples and ginger beer .  Going to the edge of the pit , I found it occupied by a group of about half a dozen men--Henderson , Ogilvy , and a tall , fair-haired man that I afterwards learned was Stent , the Astronomer Royal , with several workmen wielding spades and pickaxes .  Stent was giving directions in a clear , high-pitched voice .  He was standing on the cylinder , which was now evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and streaming with perspiration , and something seemed to have irritated him .  A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered , though its lower end was still embedded .  As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the staring crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down , and asked me if I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton , the lord of the manor .  The growing crowd , he said , was becoming a serious impediment to their excavations , especially the boys .  They wanted a light railing put up , and help to keep the people back .  He told me that a faint stirring was occasionally still audible within the case , but that the workmen had failed to unscrew the top , as it afforded no grip to them . The case appeared to be enormously thick , and it was possible that the faint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior .  I was very glad to do as he asked , and so become one of the privileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure .  I failed to find Lord Hilton at his house , but I was told he was expected from London by the six oclock train from Waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter past five , I went home , had some tea , and walked up to the station to waylay him .    CHAPTER FOUR  THE CYLINDER OPENS   When I returned to the common the sun was setting .  Scattered groups were hurrying from the direction of Woking , and one or two persons were returning .  The crowd about the pit had increased , and stood out black against the lemon yellow of the sky--a couple of hundred people , perhaps .  There were raised voices , and some sort of struggle appeared to be going on about the pit .  Strange imaginings passed through my mind .  As I drew nearer I heard Stents voice:  Keep back!  Keep back!  A boy came running towards me .  Its a-movin , he said to me as he passed; a-screwin and a-screwin out .  I dont like it .  Im a-goin ome , I am .  I went on to the crowd .  There were really , I should think , two or three hundred people elbowing and jostling one another , the one or two ladies there being by no means the least active .  Hes fallen in the pit! cried some one .  Keep back! said several .  The crowd swayed a little , and I elbowed my way through .  Every one seemed greatly excited .  I heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit .  I say! said Ogilvy; help keep these idiots back .  We dont know whats in the confounded thing , you know!  I saw a young man , a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was , standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again . The crowd had pushed him in .  The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within .  Nearly two feet of shining screw projected .  Somebody blundered against me , and I narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw .  I turned , and as I did so the screw must have come out , for the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion .  I stuck my elbow into the person behind me , and turned my head towards the Thing again .  For a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black . I had the sunset in my eyes .  I think everyone expected to see a man emerge--possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men , but in all essentials a man .  I know I did .  But , looking , I presently saw something stirring within the shadow: greyish billowy movements , one above another , and then two luminous disks--like eyes .  Then something resembling a little grey snake , about the thickness of a walking stick , coiled up out of the writhing middle , and wriggled in the air towards me--and then another .  A sudden chill came over me .  There was a loud shriek from a woman behind .  I half turned , keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still , from which other tentacles were now projecting , and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit .  I saw astonishment giving place to horror on the faces of the people about me .  I heard inarticulate exclamations on all sides .  There was a general movement backwards . I saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit .  I found myself alone , and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off , Stent among them .  I looked again at the cylinder , and ungovernable terror gripped me .  I stood petrified and staring .  A big greyish rounded bulk , the size , perhaps , of a bear , was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder .  As it bulged up and caught the light , it glistened like wet leather .  Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly .  The mass that framed them , the head of the thing , was rounded , and had , one might say , a face .  There was a mouth under the eyes , the lipless brim of which quivered and panted , and dropped saliva .  The whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively .  A lank tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder , another swayed in the air .  Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance .  The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its pointed upper lip , the absence of brow ridges , the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip , the incessant quivering of this mouth , the Gorgon groups of tentacles , the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere , the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth--above all , the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes--were at once vital , intense , inhuman , crippled and monstrous .  There was something fungoid in the oily brown skin , something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty .  Even at this first encounter , this first glimpse , I was overcome with disgust and dread .  Suddenly the monster vanished .  It had toppled over the brim of the cylinder and fallen into the pit , with a thud like the fall of a great mass of leather .  I heard it give a peculiar thick cry , and forthwith another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the aperture .  I turned and , running madly , made for the first group of trees , perhaps a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling , for I could not avert my face from these things .  There , among some young pine trees and furze bushes , I stopped , panting , and waited further developments .  The common round the sand pits was dotted with people , standing like myself in a half-fascinated terror , staring at these creatures , or rather at the heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay .  And then , with a renewed horror , I saw a round , black object bobbing up and down on the edge of the pit .  It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in , but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun .  Now he got his shoulder and knee up , and again he seemed to slip back until only his head was visible .  Suddenly he vanished , and I could have fancied a faint shriek had reached me .  I had a momentary impulse to go back and help him that my fears overruled .  Everything was then quite invisible , hidden by the deep pit and the heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made .  Anyone coming along the road from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at the sight--a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more standing in a great irregular circle , in ditches , behind bushes , behind gates and hedges , saying little to one another and that in short , excited shouts , and staring , staring hard at a few heaps of sand .  The barrow of ginger beer stood , a queer derelict , black against the burning sky , and in the sand pits was a row of deserted vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground .    CHAPTER FIVE  THE HEAT-RAY   After the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the cylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet , a kind of fascination paralysed my actions .  I remained standing knee-deep in the heather , staring at the mound that hid them .  I was a battleground of fear and curiosity .  I did not dare to go back towards the pit , but I felt a passionate longing to peer into it .  I began walking , therefore , in a big curve , seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand heaps that hid these new-comers to our earth .  Once a leash of thin black whips , like the arms of an octopus , flashed across the sunset and was immediately withdrawn , and afterwards a thin rod rose up , joint by joint , bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling motion .  What could be going on there ?  Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups--one a little crowd towards Woking , the other a knot of people in the direction of Chobham .  Evidently they shared my mental conflict . There were few near me .  One man I approached--he was , I perceived , a neighbour of mine , though I did not know his name--and accosted . But it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation .  What ugly brutes! he said .  Good God!  What ugly brutes!  He repeated this over and over again .  Did you see a man in the pit ? I said; but he made no answer to that .  We became silent , and stood watching for a time side by side , deriving , I fancy , a certain comfort in one anothers company .  Then I shifted my position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more of elevation and when I looked for him presently he was walking towards Woking .  The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened .  The crowd far away on the left , towards Woking , seemed to grow , and I heard now a faint murmur from it .  The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed .  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit .  It was this , as much as anything , that gave people courage , and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence .  At any rate , as the dusk came on a slow , intermittent movement upon the sand pits began , a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken .  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance , stop , watch , and advance again , spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns .  I , too , on my side began to move towards the pit .  Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits , and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels .  I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples .  And then , within thirty yards of the pit , advancing from the direction of Horsell , I noted a little black knot of men , the foremost of whom was waving a white flag .  This was the Deputation .  There had been a hasty consultation , and since the Martians were evidently , in spite of their repulsive forms , intelligent creatures , it had been resolved to show them , by approaching them with signals , that we too were intelligent .  Flutter , flutter , went the flag , first to the right , then to the left .  It was too far for me to recognise anyone there , but afterwards I learned that Ogilvy , Stent , and Henderson were with others in this attempt at communication .  This little group had in its advance dragged inward , so to speak , the circumference of the now almost complete circle of people , and a number of dim black figures followed it at discreet distances .  Suddenly there was a flash of light , and a quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs , which drove up , one after the other , straight into the still air .  This smoke (or flame , perhaps , would be the better word for it) was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown common towards Chertsey , set with black pine trees , seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs arose , and to remain the darker after their dispersal .  At the same time a faint hissing sound became audible .  Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at its apex , arrested by these phenomena , a little knot of small vertical black shapes upon the black ground .  As the green smoke arose , their faces flashed out pallid green , and faded again as it vanished . Then slowly the hissing passed into a humming , into a long , loud , droning noise .  Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit , and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it .  Forthwith flashes of actual flame , a bright glare leaping from one to another , sprang from the scattered group of men .  It was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame .  It was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire .  Then , by the light of their own destruction , I saw them staggering and falling , and their supporters turning to run .  I stood staring , not as yet realising that this was death leaping from man to man in that little distant crowd .  All I felt was that it was something very strange .  An almost noiseless and blinding flash of light , and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft of heat passed over them , pine trees burst into fire , and every dry furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames .  And far away towards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden buildings suddenly set alight .  It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily , this flaming death , this invisible , inevitable sword of heat .  I perceived it coming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched , and was too astounded and stupefied to stir .  I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled .  Then it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the Martians , and all along a curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled . Something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out on the common .  Forth-with the hissing and humming ceased , and the black , dome-like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit .  All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless , dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light .  Had that death swept through a full circle , it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise .  But it passed and spared me , and left the night about me suddenly dark and unfamiliar .  The undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness , except where its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early night .  It was dark , and suddenly void of men .  Overhead the stars were mustering , and in the west the sky was still a pale , bright , almost greenish blue .  The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Horsell came out sharp and black against the western afterglow .  The Martians and their appliances were altogether invisible , save for that thin mast upon which their restless mirror wobbled .  Patches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and glowed still , and the houses towards Woking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of the evening air .  Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment .  The little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out of existence , and the stillness of the evening , so it seemed to me , had scarcely been broken .  It came to me that I was upon this dark common , helpless , unprotected , and alone .  Suddenly , like a thing falling upon me from without , came--fear .  With an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through the heather .  The fear I felt was no rational fear , but a panic terror not only of the Martians , but of the dusk and stillness all about me .  Such an extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping silently as a child might do .  Once I had turned , I did not dare to look back .  I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being played with , that presently , when I was upon the very verge of safety , this mysterious death--as swift as the passage of light--would leap after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down .    CHAPTER SIX  THE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROAD   It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so swiftly and so silently .  Many think that in some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute non-conductivity .  This intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose , by means of a polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition , much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light .  But no one has absolutely proved these details .  However it is done , it is certain that a beam of heat is the essence of the matter .  Heat , and invisible , instead of visible , light .  Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch , lead runs like water , it softens iron , cracks and melts glass , and when it falls upon water , incontinently that explodes into steam .  That night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the pit , charred and distorted beyond recognition , and all night long the common from Horsell to Maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze .  The news of the massacre probably reached Chobham , Woking , and Ottershaw about the same time .  In Woking the shops had closed when the tragedy happened , and a number of people , shop people and so forth , attracted by the stories they had heard , were walking over the Horsell Bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon the common .  You may imagine the young people brushed up after the labours of the day , and making this novelty , as they would make any novelty , the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivial flirtation .  You may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road in the gloaming .  .  .  .  As yet , of course , few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder had opened , though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the post office with a special wire to an evening paper .  As these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open , they found little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning mirror over the sand pits , and the newcomers were , no doubt , soon infected by the excitement of the occasion .  By half past eight , when the Deputation was destroyed , there may have been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place , besides those who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer . There were three policemen too , one of whom was mounted , doing their best , under instructions from Stent , to keep the people back and deter them from approaching the cylinder .  There was some booing from those more thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an occasion for noise and horse-play .  Stent and Ogilvy , anticipating some possibilities of a collision , had telegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians emerged , for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange creatures from violence .  After that they returned to lead that ill-fated advance .  The description of their death , as it was seen by the crowd , tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three puffs of green smoke , the deep humming note , and the flashes of flame .  But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine .  Only the fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the Heat-Ray saved them .  Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a few yards higher , none could have lived to tell the tale .  They saw the flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand , as it were , lit the bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight .  Then , with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit , the beam swung close over their heads , lighting the tops of the beech trees that line the road , and splitting the bricks , smashing the windows , firing the window frames , and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner .  In the sudden thud , hiss , and glare of the igniting trees , the panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some moments .  Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road , and single leaves like puffs of flame .  Hats and dresses caught fire .  Then came a crying from the common .  There were shrieks and shouts , and suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with his hands clasped over his head , screaming .  Theyre coming! a woman shrieked , and incontinently everyone was turning and pushing at those behind , in order to clear their way to Woking again .  They must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep . Where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd jammed , and a desperate struggle occurred .  All that crowd did not escape; three persons at least , two women and a little boy , were crushed and trampled there , and left to die amid the terror and the darkness .    CHAPTER SEVEN  HOW I REACHED HOME   For my own part , I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather .  All about me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; that pitiless sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro , flourishing overhead before it descended and smote me out of life .  I came into the road between the crossroads and Horsell , and ran along this to the crossroads .  At last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the violence of my emotion and of my flight , and I staggered and fell by the wayside . That was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks .  I fell and lay still .  I must have remained there some time .  I sat up , strangely perplexed .  For a moment , perhaps , I could not clearly understand how I came there .  My terror had fallen from me like a garment .  My hat had gone , and my collar had burst away from its fastener .  A few minutes before , there had only been three real things before me--the immensity of the night and space and nature , my own feebleness and anguish , and the near approach of death .  Now it was as if something turned over , and the point of view altered abruptly .  There was no sensible transition from one state of mind to the other .  I was immediately the self of every day again--a decent , ordinary citizen .  The silent common , the impulse of my flight , the starting flames , were as if they had been in a dream .  I asked myself had these latter things indeed happened ?  I could not credit it .  I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge .  My mind was blank wonder .  My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their strength .  I dare say I staggered drunkenly .  A head rose over the arch , and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared .  Beside him ran a little boy .  He passed me , wishing me good night .  I was minded to speak to him , but did not .  I answered his greeting with a meaningless mumble and went on over the bridge .  Over the Maybury arch a train , a billowing tumult of white , firelit smoke , and a long caterpillar of lighted windows , went flying south--clatter , clatter , clap , rap , and it had gone .  A dim group of people talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little row of gables that was called Oriental Terrace .  It was all so real and so familiar .  And that behind me!  It was frantic , fantastic! Such things , I told myself , could not be .  Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods .  I do not know how far my experience is common .  At times I suffer from the strangest sense of detachment from myself and the world about me; I seem to watch it all from the outside , from somewhere inconceivably remote , out of time , out of space , out of the stress and tragedy of it all .  This feeling was very strong upon me that night .  Here was another side to my dream .  But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the swift death flying yonder , not two miles away .  There was a noise of business from the gasworks , and the electric lamps were all alight .  I stopped at the group of people .  What news from the common ? said I .  There were two men and a woman at the gate .  Eh ? said one of the men , turning .  What news from the common ? I said .  Aint yer just been there ? asked the men .  People seem fair silly about the common , said the woman over the gate .  Whats it all abart ?  Havent you heard of the men from Mars ? said I; the creatures from Mars ?  Quite enough , said the woman over the gate .  Thenks; and all three of them laughed .  I felt foolish and angry .  I tried and found I could not tell them what I had seen .  They laughed again at my broken sentences .  Youll hear more yet , I said , and went on to my home .  I startled my wife at the doorway , so haggard was I .  I went into the dining room , sat down , drank some wine , and so soon as I could collect myself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen .  The dinner , which was a cold one , had already been served , and remained neglected on the table while I told my story .  There is one thing , I said , to allay the fears I had aroused; they are the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl .  They may keep the pit and kill people who come near them , but they cannot get out of it .  .  .  .  But the horror of them!  Dont , dear! said my wife , knitting her brows and putting her hand on mine .  Poor Ogilvy! I said .  To think he may be lying dead there!  My wife at least did not find my experience incredible .  When I saw how deadly white her face was , I ceased abruptly .  They may come here , she said again and again .  I pressed her to take wine , and tried to reassure her .  They can scarcely move , I said .  I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy had told me of the impossibility of the Martians establishing themselves on the earth .  In particular I laid stress on the gravitational difficulty .  On the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is on the surface of Mars .  A Martian , therefore , would weigh three times more than on Mars , albeit his muscular strength would be the same .  His own body would be a cope of lead to him .  That , indeed , was the general opinion .  Both The Times and the Daily Telegraph , for instance , insisted on it the next morning , and both overlooked , just as I did , two obvious modifying influences .  The atmosphere of the earth , we now know , contains far more oxygen or far less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars . The invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their bodies .  And , in the second place , we all overlooked the fact that such mechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch .  But I did not consider these points at the time , and so my reasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders .  With wine and food , the confidence of my own table , and the necessity of reassuring my wife , I grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure .  They have done a foolish thing , said I , fingering my wineglass . They are dangerous because , no doubt , they are mad with terror . Perhaps they expected to find no living things--certainly no intelligent living things .  A shell in the pit said I , if the worst comes to the worst will kill them all .  The intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my perceptive powers in a state of erethism .  I remember that dinner table with extraordinary vividness even now .  My dear wifes sweet anxious face peering at me from under the pink lamp shade , the white cloth with its silver and glass table furniture--for in those days even philosophical writers had many little luxuries--the crimson-purple wine in my glass , are photographically distinct .  At the end of it I sat , tempering nuts with a cigarette , regretting Ogilvys rashness , and denouncing the shortsighted timidity of the Martians .  So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it in his nest , and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless sailors in want of animal food .  We will peck them to death tomorrow , my dear .  I did not know it , but that was the last civilised dinner I was to eat for very many strange and terrible days .    CHAPTER EIGHT  FRIDAY NIGHT   The most extraordinary thing to my mind , of all the strange and wonderful things that happened upon that Friday , was the dovetailing of the commonplace habits of our social order with the first beginnings of the series of events that was to topple that social order headlong .  If on Friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the Woking sand pits , I doubt if you would have had one human being outside it , unless it were some relation of Stent or of the three or four cyclists or London people lying dead on the common , whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the new-comers .  Many people had heard of the cylinder , of course , and talked about it in their leisure , but it certainly did not make the sensation that an ultimatum to Germany would have done .  In London that night poor Hendersons telegram describing the gradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard , and his evening paper , after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no reply--the man was killed--decided not to print a special edition .  Even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were inert .  I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to whom I spoke .  All over the district people were dining and supping; working men were gardening after the labours of the day , children were being put to bed , young people were wandering through the lanes love-making , students sat over their books .  Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets , a novel and dominant topic in the public-houses , and here and there a messenger , or even an eye-witness of the later occurrences , caused a whirl of excitement , a shouting , and a running to and fro; but for the most part the daily routine of working , eating , drinking , sleeping , went on as it had done for countless years--as though no planet Mars existed in the sky .  Even at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was the case .  In Woking junction , until a late hour , trains were stopping and going on , others were shunting on the sidings , passengers were alighting and waiting , and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way .  A boy from the town , trenching on Smiths monopoly , was selling papers with the afternoons news .  The ringing impact of trucks , the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction , mingled with their shouts of Men from Mars!  Excited men came into the station about nine oclock with incredible tidings , and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might have done .  People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows , and saw only a rare , flickering , vanishing spark dance up from the direction of Horsell , a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving across the stars , and thought that nothing more serious than a heath fire was happening .  It was only round the edge of the common that any disturbance was perceptible .  There were half a dozen villas burning on the Woking border .  There were lights in all the houses on the common side of the three villages , and the people there kept awake till dawn .  A curious crowd lingered restlessly , people coming and going but the crowd remaining , both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges .  One or two adventurous souls , it was afterwards found , went into the darkness and crawled quite near the Martians; but they never returned , for now and again a light-ray , like the beam of a warships searchlight swept the common , and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow .  Save for such , that big area of common was silent and desolate , and the charred bodies lay about on it all night under the stars , and all the next day .  A noise of hammering from the pit was heard by many people .  So you have the state of things on Friday night .  In the centre , sticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart , was this cylinder .  But the poison was scarcely working yet .  Around it was a patch of silent common , smouldering in places , and with a few dark , dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there . Here and there was a burning bush or tree .  Beyond was a fringe of excitement , and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not crept as yet .  In the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed as it had flowed for immemorial years .  The fever of war that would presently clog vein and artery , deaden nerve and destroy brain , had still to develop .  All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring , sleepless , indefatigable , at work upon the machines they were making ready , and ever and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the starlit sky .  About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell , and deployed along the edge of the common to form a cordon .  Later a second company marched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of the common .  Several officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on the common earlier in the day , and one , Major Eden , was reported to be missing .  The colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge and was busy questioning the crowd at midnight .  The military authorities were certainly alive to the seriousness of the business .  About eleven , the next mornings papers were able to say , a squadron of hussars , two Maxims , and about four hundred men of the Cardigan regiment started from Aldershot .  A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road , Woking , saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest .  It had a greenish colour , and caused a silent brightness like summer lightning .  This was the second cylinder .    CHAPTER NINE  THE FIGHTING BEGINS   Saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense .  It was a day of lassitude too , hot and close , with , I am told , a rapidly fluctuating barometer .  I had slept but little , though my wife had succeeded in sleeping , and I rose early .  I went into my garden before breakfast and stood listening , but towards the common there was nothing stirring but a lark .  The milkman came as usual .  I heard the rattle of his chariot and I went round to the side gate to ask the latest news .  He told me that during the night the Martians had been surrounded by troops , and that guns were expected .  Then--a familiar , reassuring note--I heard a train running towards Woking .  They arent to be killed , said the milkman , if that can possibly be avoided .  I saw my neighbour gardening , chatted with him for a time , and then strolled in to breakfast .  It was a most unexceptional morning .  My neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to destroy the Martians during the day .  Its a pity they make themselves so unapproachable , he said .  It would be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might learn a thing or two .  He came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries , for his gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic .  At the same time he told me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet Golf Links .  They say , said he , that theres another of those blessed things fallen there--number two .  But ones enough , surely .  This lotll cost the insurance people a pretty penny before everythings settled .  He laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this .  The woods , he said , were still burning , and pointed out a haze of smoke to me .  They will be hot under foot for days , on account of the thick soil of pine needles and turf , he said , and then grew serious over poor Ogilvy .  After breakfast , instead of working , I decided to walk down towards the common .  Under the railway bridge I found a group of soldiers--sappers , I think , men in small round caps , dirty red jackets unbuttoned , and showing their blue shirts , dark trousers , and boots coming to the calf .  They told me no one was allowed over the canal , and , looking along the road towards the bridge , I saw one of the Cardigan men standing sentinel there .  I talked with these soldiers for a time; I told them of my sight of the Martians on the previous evening .  None of them had seen the Martians , and they had but the vaguest ideas of them , so that they plied me with questions .  They said that they did not know who had authorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute had arisen at the Horse Guards . The ordinary sapper is a great deal better educated than the common soldier , and they discussed the peculiar conditions of the possible fight with some acuteness .  I described the Heat-Ray to them , and they began to argue among themselves .  Crawl up under cover and rush em , say I , said one .  Get aht! said another .  Whats cover against this ere eat ? Sticks to cook yer!  What we got to do is to go as near as the groundll let us , and then drive a trench .  Blow yer trenches!  You always want trenches; you ought to ha been born a rabbit Snippy .  Aint they got any necks , then ? said a third , abruptly--a little , contemplative , dark man , smoking a pipe .  I repeated my description .  Octopuses , said he , thats what I calls em .  Talk about fishers of men--fighters of fish it is this time!  It aint no murder killing beasts like that , said the first speaker .  Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish em ? said the little dark man .  You carn tell what they might do .  Wheres your shells ? said the first speaker .  There aint no time .  Do it in a rush , thats my tip , and do it at once .  So they discussed it .  After a while I left them , and went on to the railway station to get as many morning papers as I could .  But I will not weary the reader with a description of that long morning and of the longer afternoon .  I did not succeed in getting a glimpse of the common , for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were in the hands of the military authorities .  The soldiers I addressed didnt know anything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy .  I found people in the town quite secure again in the presence of the military , and I heard for the first time from Marshall , the tobacconist , that his son was among the dead on the common .  The soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of Horsell lock up and leave their houses .  I got back to lunch about two , very tired for , as I have said , the day was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took a cold bath in the afternoon .  About half past four I went up to the railway station to get an evening paper , for the morning papers had contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent , Henderson , Ogilvy , and the others .  But there was little I didnt know .  The Martians did not show an inch of themselves .  They seemed busy in their pit , and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous streamer of smoke .  Apparently they were busy getting ready for a struggle .  Fresh attempts have been made to signal , but without success , was the stereotyped formula of the papers .  A sapper told me it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole .  The Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the lowing of a cow .  I must confess the sight of all this armament , all this preparation , greatly excited me .  My imagination became belligerent , and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came back .  It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at that time .  They seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs .  About three oclock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals from Chertsey or Addlestone .  I learned that the smouldering pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled , in the hope of destroying that object before it opened .  It was only about five , however , that a field gun reached Chobham for use against the first body of Martians .  About six in the evening , as I sat at tea with my wife in the summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon us , I heard a muffled detonation from the common , and immediately after a gust of firing .  Close on the heels of that came a violent rattling crash , quite close to us , that shook the ground; and , starting out upon the lawn , I saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst into smoky red flame , and the tower of the little church beside it slide down into ruin .  The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished , and the roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been at work upon it .  One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it , flew , and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window .  I and my wife stood amazed .  Then I realised that the crest of Maybury Hill must be within range of the Martians Heat-Ray now that the college was cleared out of the way .  At that I gripped my wifes arm , and without ceremony ran her out into the road .  Then I fetched out the servant , telling her I would go upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for .  We cant possibly stay here , I said; and as I spoke the firing reopened for a moment upon the common .  But where are we to go ? said my wife in terror .  I thought perplexed .  Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead .  Leatherhead! I shouted above the sudden noise .  She looked away from me downhill .  The people were coming out of their houses , astonished .  How are we to get to Leatherhead ? she said .  Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge; three galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College; two others dismounted , and began running from house to house .  The sun , shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees , seemed blood red , and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything .  Stop here , said I; you are safe here; and I started off at once for the Spotted Dog , for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart . I ran , for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the hill would be moving .  I found him in his bar , quite unaware of what was going on behind his house .  A man stood with his back to me , talking to him .  I must have a pound , said the landlord , and Ive no one to drive it .  Ill give you two , said I , over the strangers shoulder .  What for ?  And Ill bring it back by midnight , I said .  Lord! said the landlord; whats the hurry ?  Im selling my bit of a pig .  Two pounds , and you bring it back ?  Whats going on now ?  I explained hastily that I had to leave my home , and so secured the dog cart .  At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the landlord should leave his .  I took care to have the cart there and then , drove it off down the road , and , leaving it in charge of my wife and servant , rushed into my house and packed a few valuables , such plate as we had , and so forth .  The beech trees below the house were burning while I did this , and the palings up the road glowed red . While I was occupied in this way , one of the dismounted hussars came running up .  He was going from house to house , warning people to leave .  He was going on as I came out of my front door , lugging my treasures , done up in a tablecloth .  I shouted after him:  What news ?  He turned , stared , bawled something about crawling out in a thing like a dish cover , and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest . A sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a moment .  I ran to my neighbours door and rapped to satisfy myself of what I already knew , that his wife had gone to London with him and had locked up their house .  I went in again , according to my promise , to get my servants box , lugged it out , clapped it beside her on the tail of the dog cart , and then caught the reins and jumped up into the drivers seat beside my wife .  In another moment we were clear of the smoke and noise , and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill towards Old Woking .  In front was a quiet sunny landscape , a wheat field ahead on either side of the road , and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign .  I saw the doctors cart ahead of me .  At the bottom of the hill I turned my head to look at the hillside I was leaving .  Thick streamers of black smoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air , and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward .  The smoke already extended far away to the east and west--to the Byfleet pine woods eastward , and to Woking on the west .  The road was dotted with people running towards us .  And very faint now , but very distinct through the hot , quiet air , one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that was presently stilled , and an intermittent cracking of rifles . Apparently the Martians were setting fire to everything within range of their Heat-Ray .  I am not an expert driver , and I had immediately to turn my attention to the horse .  When I looked back again the second hill had hidden the black smoke .  I slashed the horse with the whip , and gave him a loose rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that quivering tumult .  I overtook and passed the doctor between Woking and Send .    CHAPTER TEN  IN THE STORM   Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill .  The scent of hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford , and the hedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses . The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began , leaving the evening very peaceful and still .  We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine oclock , and the horse had an hours rest while I took supper with my cousins and commended my wife to their care .  My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive , and seemed oppressed with forebodings of evil .  I talked to her reassuringly , pointing out that the Martians were tied to the Pit by sheer heaviness , and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in monosyllables .  Had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper , she would , I think , have urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night .  Would that I had!  Her face , I remember , was very white as we parted .  For my own part , I had been feverishly excited all day .  Something very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community had got into my blood , and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I had to return to Maybury that night .  I was even afraid that that last fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from Mars .  I can best express my state of mind by saying that I wanted to be in at the death .  It was nearly eleven when I started to return .  The night was unexpectedly dark; to me , walking out of the lighted passage of my cousins house , it seemed indeed black , and it was as hot and close as the day .  Overhead the clouds were driving fast , albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us .  My cousins man lit both lamps .  Happily , I knew the road intimately .  My wife stood in the light of the doorway , and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart .  Then abruptly she turned and went in , leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good hap .  I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wifes fears , but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians .  At that time I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evenings fighting .  I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated the conflict .  As I came through Ockham (for that was the way I returned , and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western horizon a blood-red glow , which as I drew nearer , crept slowly up the sky .  The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there with masses of black and red smoke .  Ripley Street was deserted , and except for a lighted window or so the village showed not a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an accident at the corner of the road to Pyrford , where a knot of people stood with their backs to me .  They said nothing to me as I passed .  I do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill , nor do I know if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping securely , or deserted and empty , or harassed and watching against the terror of the night .  From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the Wey , and the red glare was hidden from me .  As I ascended the little hill beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view again , and the trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was upon me .  Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church behind me , and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill , with its tree-tops and roofs black and sharp against the red .  Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and showed the distant woods towards Addlestone .  I felt a tug at the reins .  I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread of green fire , suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the field to my left .  It was the third falling star!  Close on its apparition , and blindingly violet by contrast , danced out the first lightning of the gathering storm , and the thunder burst like a rocket overhead .  The horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted .  A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill , and down this we clattered .  Once the lightning had begun , it went on in as rapid a succession of flashes as I have ever seen .  The thunderclaps , treading one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling accompaniment , sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric machine than the usual detonating reverberations .  The flickering light was blinding and confusing , and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as I drove down the slope .  At first I regarded little but the road before me , and then abruptly my attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill .  At first I took it for the wet roof of a house , but one flash following another showed it to be in swift rolling movement .  It was an elusive vision--a moment of bewildering darkness , and then , in a flash like daylight , the red masses of the Orphanage near the crest of the hill , the green tops of the pine trees , and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright .  And this Thing I saw!  How can I describe it ?  A monstrous tripod , higher than many houses , striding over the young pine trees , and smashing them aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal , striding now across the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it , and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder .  A flash , and it came out vividly , heeling over one way with two feet in the air , to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed , with the next flash , a hundred yards nearer .  Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground ?  That was the impression those instant flashes gave . But instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on a tripod stand .  Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted , as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were snapped off and driven headlong , and a second huge tripod appeared , rushing , as it seemed , headlong towards me .  And I was galloping hard to meet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether .  Not stopping to look again , I wrenched the horses head hard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the horse; the shafts smashed noisily , and I was flung sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool of water .  I crawled out almost immediately , and crouched , my feet still in the water , under a clump of furze .  The horse lay motionless (his neck was broken , poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly .  In another moment the colossal mechanism went striding by me , and passed uphill towards Pyrford .  Seen nearer , the Thing was incredibly strange , for it was no mere insensate machine driving on its way .  Machine it was , with a ringing metallic pace , and long , flexible , glittering tentacles (one of which gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange body .  It picked its road as it went striding along , and the brazen hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a head looking about .  Behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal like a gigantic fishermans basket , and puffs of green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me .  And in an instant it was gone .  So much I saw then , all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning , in blinding highlights and dense black shadows .  As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the thunder--Aloo!  Aloo!--and in another minute it was with its companion , half a mile away , stooping over something in the field .  I have no doubt this Thing in the field was the third of the ten cylinders they had fired at us from Mars .  For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching , by the intermittent light , these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the distance over the hedge tops .  A thin hail was now beginning , and as it came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness again .  Now and then came a gap in the lightning , and the night swallowed them up .  I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below .  It was some time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a drier position , or think at all of my imminent peril .  Not far from me was a little one-roomed squatters hut of wood , surrounded by a patch of potato garden .  I struggled to my feet at last , and , crouching and making use of every chance of cover , I made a run for this .  I hammered at the door , but I could not make the people hear (if there were any people inside) , and after a time I desisted , and , availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way , succeeded in crawling , unobserved by these monstrous machines , into the pine woods towards Maybury .  Under cover of this I pushed on , wet and shivering now , towards my own house .  I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath .  It was very dark indeed in the wood , for the lightning was now becoming infrequent , and the hail , which was pouring down in a torrent , fell in columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage .  If I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen I should have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street Cobham , and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead .  But that night the strangeness of things about me , and my physical wretchedness , prevented me , for I was bruised , weary , wet to the skin , deafened and blinded by the storm .  I had a vague idea of going on to my own house , and that was as much motive as I had .  I staggered through the trees , fell into a ditch and bruised my knees against a plank , and finally splashed out into the lane that ran down from the College Arms .  I say splashed , for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent .  There in the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling back .  He gave a cry of terror , sprang sideways , and rushed on before I could gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him .  So heavy was the stress of the storm just at this place that I had the hardest task to win my way up the hill .  I went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way along its palings .  Near the top I stumbled upon something soft , and , by a flash of lightning , saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of boots .  Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay , the flicker of light had passed .  I stood over him waiting for the next flash .  When it came , I saw that he was a sturdy man , cheaply but not shabbily dressed; his head was bent under his body , and he lay crumpled up close to the fence , as though he had been flung violently against it .  Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a dead body , I stooped and turned him over to feel for his heart .  He was quite dead .  Apparently his neck had been broken .  The lightning flashed for a third time , and his face leaped upon me .  I sprang to my feet .  It was the landlord of the Spotted Dog , whose conveyance I had taken .  I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill .  I made my way by the police station and the College Arms towards my own house . Nothing was burning on the hillside , though from the common there still came a red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the drenching hail .  So far as I could see by the flashes , the houses about me were mostly uninjured .  By the College Arms a dark heap lay in the road .  Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and the sound of feet , but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them .  I let myself in with my latchkey , closed , locked and bolted the door , staggered to the foot of the staircase , and sat down .  My imagination was full of those striding metallic monsters , and of the dead body smashed against the fence .  I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall , shivering violently .    CHAPTER ELEVEN  AT THE WINDOW   I have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of exhausting themselves .  After a time I discovered that I was cold and wet , and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet .  I got up almost mechanically , went into the dining room and drank some whiskey , and then I was moved to change my clothes .  After I had done that I went upstairs to my study , but why I did so I do not know .  The window of my study looks over the trees and the railway towards Horsell Common .  In the hurry of our departure this window had been left open .  The passage was dark , and , by contrast with the picture the window frame enclosed , the side of the room seemed impenetrably dark .  I stopped short in the doorway .  The thunderstorm had passed .  The towers of the Oriental College and the pine trees about it had gone , and very far away , lit by a vivid red glare , the common about the sand pits was visible .  Across the light huge black shapes , grotesque and strange , moved busily to and fro .  It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on fire--a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame , swaying and writhing with the gusts of the dying storm , and throwing a red reflection upon the cloud-scud above .  Every now and then a haze of smoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid the Martian shapes .  I could not see what they were doing , nor the clear form of them , nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon .  Neither could I see the nearer fire , though the reflections of it danced on the wall and ceiling of the study .  A sharp , resinous tang of burning was in the air .  I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window .  As I did so , the view opened out until , on the one hand , it reached to the houses about Woking station , and on the other to the charred and blackened pine woods of Byfleet .  There was a light down below the hill , on the railway , near the arch , and several of the houses along the Maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins . The light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black heap and a vivid glare , and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs .  Then I perceived this was a wrecked train , the fore part smashed and on fire , the hinder carriages still upon the rails .  Between these three main centres of light--the houses , the train , and the burning county towards Chobham--stretched irregular patches of dark country , broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and smoking ground .  It was the strangest spectacle , that black expanse set with fire .  It reminded me , more than anything else , of the Potteries at night .  At first I could distinguish no people at all , though I peered intently for them .  Later I saw against the light of Woking station a number of black figures hurrying one after the other across the line .  And this was the little world in which I had been living securely for years , this fiery chaos!  What had happened in the last seven hours I still did not know; nor did I know , though I was beginning to guess , the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps I had seen disgorged from the cylinder .  With a queer feeling of impersonal interest I turned my desk chair to the window , sat down , and stared at the blackened country , and particularly at the three gigantic black things that were going to and fro in the glare about the sand pits .  They seemed amazingly busy .  I began to ask myself what they could be .  Were they intelligent mechanisms ?  Such a thing I felt was impossible .  Or did a Martian sit within each , ruling , directing , using , much as a mans brain sits and rules in his body ?  I began to compare the things to human machines , to ask myself for the first time in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent lower animal .  The storm had left the sky clear , and over the smoke of the burning land the little fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping into the west , when a soldier came into my garden .  I heard a slight scraping at the fence , and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me , I looked down and saw him dimly , clambering over the palings .  At the sight of another human being my torpor passed , and I leaned out of the window eagerly .  Hist! said I , in a whisper .  He stopped astride of the fence in doubt .  Then he came over and across the lawn to the corner of the house .  He bent down and stepped softly .  Whos there ? he said , also whispering , standing under the window and peering up .  Where are you going ? I asked .  God knows .  Are you trying to hide ?  Thats it .  Come into the house , I said .  I went down , unfastened the door , and let him in , and locked the door again .  I could not see his face .  He was hatless , and his coat was unbuttoned .  My God! he said , as I drew him in .  What has happened ? I asked .  What hasnt ?  In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture of despair .  They wiped us out--simply wiped us out , he repeated again and again .  He followed me , almost mechanically , into the dining room .  Take some whiskey , I said , pouring out a stiff dose .  He drank it .  Then abruptly he sat down before the table , put his head on his arms , and began to sob and weep like a little boy , in a perfect passion of emotion , while I , with a curious forgetfulness of my own recent despair , stood beside him , wondering .  It was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my questions , and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly .  He was a driver in the artillery , and had only come into action about seven .  At that time firing was going on across the common , and it was said the first party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their second cylinder under cover of a metal shield .  Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of the fighting-machines I had seen .  The gun he drove had been unlimbered near Horsell , in order to command the sand pits , and its arrival it was that had precipitated the action .  As the limber gunners went to the rear , his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came down , throwing him into a depression of the ground .  At the same moment the gun exploded behind him , the ammunition blew up , there was fire all about him , and he found himself lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses .  I lay still , he said , scared out of my wits , with the fore quarter of a horse atop of me .  Wed been wiped out .  And the smell--good God!  Like burnt meat!  I was hurt across the back by the fall of the horse , and there I had to lie until I felt better .  Just like parade it had been a minute before--then stumble , bang , swish!  Wiped out! he said .  He had hid under the dead horse for a long time , peeping out furtively across the common .  The Cardigan men had tried a rush , in skirmishing order , at the pit , simply to be swept out of existence . Then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the common among the few fugitives , with its headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being .  A kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case , about which green flashes scintillated , and out of the funnel of this there smoked the Heat-Ray .  In a few minutes there was , so far as the soldier could see , not a living thing left upon the common , and every bush and tree upon it that was not already a blackened skeleton was burning .  The hussars had been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground , and he saw nothing of them .  He heard the Martians rattle for a time and then become still .  The giant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses until the last; then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear , and the town became a heap of fiery ruins .  Then the Thing shut off the Heat-Ray , and turning its back upon the artilleryman , began to waddle away towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second cylinder .  As it did so a second glittering Titan built itself up out of the pit .  The second monster followed the first , and at that the artilleryman began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards Horsell .  He managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the road , and so escaped to Woking .  There his story became ejaculatory . The place was impassable .  It seems there were a few people alive there , frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded .  He was turned aside by the fire , and hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken wall as one of the Martian giants returned .  He saw this one pursue a man , catch him up in one of its steely tentacles , and knock his head against the trunk of a pine tree .  At last , after nightfall , the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment .  Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury , in the hope of getting out of danger Londonward .  People were hiding in trenches and cellars , and many of the survivors had made off towards Woking village and Send .  He had been consumed with thirst until he found one of the water mains near the railway arch smashed , and the water bubbling out like a spring upon the road .  That was the story I got from him , bit by bit .  He grew calmer telling me and trying to make me see the things he had seen .  He had eaten no food since midday , he told me early in his narrative , and I found some mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the room .  We lit no lamp for fear of attracting the Martians , and ever and again our hands would touch upon bread or meat .  As he talked , things about us came darkly out of the darkness , and the trampled bushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct .  It would seem that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn . I began to see his face , blackened and haggard , as no doubt mine was also .  When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study , and I looked again out of the open window .  In one night the valley had become a valley of ashes .  The fires had dwindled now .  Where flames had been there were now streamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of shattered and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn .  Yet here and there some object had had the luck to escape--a white railway signal here , the end of a greenhouse there , white and fresh amid the wreckage .  Never before in the history of warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal . And shining with the growing light of the east , three of the metallic giants stood about the pit , their cowls rotating as though they were surveying the desolation they had made .  It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged , and ever and again puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the brightening dawn--streamed up , whirled , broke , and vanished .  Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham .  They became pillars of bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day .    CHAPTER TWELVE  WHAT I SAW OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTON   As the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had watched the Martians , and went very quietly downstairs .  The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in .  He proposed , he said , to make his way Londonward , and thence rejoin his battery--No . 12 , of the Horse Artillery .  My plan was to return at once to Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the Martians impressed me that I had determined to take my wife to Newhaven , and go with her out of the country forthwith .  For I already perceived clearly that the country about London must inevitably be the scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed .  Between us and Leatherhead , however , lay the third cylinder , with its guarding giants .  Had I been alone , I think I should have taken my chance and struck across country .  But the artilleryman dissuaded me: Its no kindness to the right sort of wife , he said , to make her a widow; and in the end I agreed to go with him , under cover of the woods , northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him . Thence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead .  I should have started at once , but my companion had been in active service and he knew better than that .  He made me ransack the house for a flask , which he filled with whiskey; and we lined every available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat .  Then we crept out of the house , and ran as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by which I had come overnight .  The houses seemed deserted . In the road lay a group of three charred bodies close together , struck dead by the Heat-Ray; and here and there were things that people had dropped--a clock , a slipper , a silver spoon , and the like poor valuables .  At the corner turning up towards the post office a little cart , filled with boxes and furniture , and horseless , heeled over on a broken wheel .  A cash box had been hastily smashed open and thrown under the debris .  Except the lodge at the Orphanage , which was still on fire , none of the houses had suffered very greatly here .  The Heat-Ray had shaved the chimney tops and passed .  Yet , save ourselves , there did not seem to be a living soul on Maybury Hill .  The majority of the inhabitants had escaped , I suppose , by way of the Old Woking road--the road I had taken when I drove to Leatherhead--or they had hidden .  We went down the lane , by the body of the man in black , sodden now from the overnight hail , and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill .  We pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul .  The woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of woods; for the most part the trees had fallen , but a certain proportion still stood , dismal grey stems , with dark brown foliage instead of green .  On our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees; it had failed to secure its footing .  In one place the woodmen had been at work on Saturday; trees , felled and freshly trimmed , lay in a clearing , with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine . Hard by was a temporary hut , deserted .  There was not a breath of wind this morning , and everything was strangely still .  Even the birds were hushed , and as we hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in whispers and looked now and again over our shoulders .  Once or twice we stopped to listen .  After a time we drew near the road , and as we did so we heard the clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers riding slowly towards Woking .  We hailed them , and they halted while we hurried towards them .  It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of the 8th Hussars , with a stand like a theodolite , which the artilleryman told me was a heliograph .  You are the first men Ive seen coming this way this morning , said the lieutenant .  Whats brewing ?  His voice and face were eager .  The men behind him stared curiously .  The artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted .  Gun destroyed last night , sir .  Have been hiding .  Trying to rejoin battery , sir .  Youll come in sight of the Martians , I expect , about half a mile along this road .  What the dickens are they like ? asked the lieutenant .  Giants in armour , sir .  Hundred feet high .  Three legs and a body like luminium , with a mighty great head in a hood , sir .  Get out! said the lieutenant .  What confounded nonsense!  Youll see , sir .  They carry a kind of box , sir , that shoots fire and strikes you dead .  What dye mean--a gun ?  No , sir , and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray . Halfway through , the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me .  I was still standing on the bank by the side of the road .  Its perfectly true , I said .  Well , said the lieutenant , I suppose its my business to see it too .  Look here--to the artilleryman--were detailed here clearing people out of their houses .  Youd better go along and report yourself to Brigadier-General Marvin , and tell him all you know .  Hes at Weybridge .  Know the way ?  I do , I said; and he turned his horse southward again .  Half a mile , you say ? said he .  At most , I answered , and pointed over the treetops southward .  He thanked me and rode on , and we saw them no more .  Farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in the road , busy clearing out a labourers cottage .  They had got hold of a little hand truck , and were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture .  They were all too assiduously engaged to talk to us as we passed .  By Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees , and found the country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight .  We were far beyond the range of the Heat-Ray there , and had it not been for the silent desertion of some of the houses , the stirring movement of packing in others , and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge over the railway and staring down the line towards Woking , the day would have seemed very like any other Sunday .  Several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road to Addlestone , and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw , across a stretch of flat meadow , six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equal distances pointing towards Woking .  The gunners stood by the guns waiting , and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance . The men stood almost as if under inspection .  Thats good! said I .  They will get one fair shot , at any rate .  The artilleryman hesitated at the gate .  I shall go on , he said .  Farther on towards Weybridge , just over the bridge , there were a number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart , and more guns behind .  Its bows and arrows against the lightning , anyhow , said the artilleryman .  They avent seen that fire-beam yet .  The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the treetops southwestward , and the men digging would stop every now and again to stare in the same direction .  Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing , and a score of hussars , some of them dismounted , some on horseback , were hunting them about . Three or four black government waggons , with crosses in white circles , and an old omnibus , among other vehicles , were being loaded in the village street .  There were scores of people , most of them sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes .  The soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their position .  We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids , angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind . I stopped and gripped his arm .  Do you know whats over there ? I said , pointing at the pine tops that hid the Martians .  Eh ? said he , turning .  I was explainin these is vallyble .  Death! I shouted .  Death is coming!  Death! and leaving him to digest that if he could , I hurried on after the artillery-man .  At the corner I looked back .  The soldier had left him , and he was still standing by his box , with the pots of orchids on the lid of it , and staring vaguely over the trees .  No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were established; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen in any town before .  Carts , carriages everywhere , the most astonishing miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh .  The respectable inhabitants of the place , men in golf and boating costumes , wives prettily dressed , were packing , river-side loafers energetically helping , children excited , and , for the most part , highly delighted at this astonishing variation of their Sunday experiences .  In the midst of it all the worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration , and his bell was jangling out above the excitement .  I and the artilleryman , seated on the step of the drinking fountain , made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us . Patrols of soldiers--here no longer hussars , but grenadiers in white--were warning people to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the firing began .  We saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station , and the swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages . The ordinary traffic had been stopped , I believe , in order to allow of the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey , and I have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at a later hour .  We remained at Weybridge until midday , and at that hour we found ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames join .  Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little cart .  The Wey has a treble mouth , and at this point boats are to be hired , and there was a ferry across the river .  On the Shepperton side was an inn with a lawn , and beyond that the tower of Shepperton Church--it has been replaced by a spire--rose above the trees .  Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives .  As yet the flight had not grown to a panic , but there were already far more people than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross . People came panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife were even carrying a small outhouse door between them , with some of their household goods piled thereon .  One man told us he meant to try to get away from Shepperton station .  There was a lot of shouting , and one man was even jesting .  The idea people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply formidable human beings , who might attack and sack the town , to be certainly destroyed in the end .  Every now and then people would glance nervously across the Wey , at the meadows towards Chertsey , but everything over there was still .  Across the Thames , except just where the boats landed , everything was quiet , in vivid contrast with the Surrey side .  The people who landed there from the boats went tramping off down the lane .  The big ferryboat had just made a journey .  Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn , staring and jesting at the fugitives , without offering to help .  The inn was closed , as it was now within prohibited hours .  Whats that ? cried a boatman , and Shut up , you fool! said a man near me to a yelping dog .  Then the sound came again , this time from the direction of Chertsey , a muffled thud--the sound of a gun .  The fighting was beginning .  Almost immediately unseen batteries across the river to our right , unseen because of the trees , took up the chorus , firing heavily one after the other .  A woman screamed . Everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle , near us and yet invisible to us .  Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows , cows feeding unconcernedly for the most part , and silvery pollard willows motionless in the warm sunlight .  The sojersll stop em , said a woman beside me , doubtfully .  A haziness rose over the treetops .  Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river , a puff of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air , smashing two or three windows in the houses near , and leaving us astonished .  Here they are! shouted a man in a blue jersey .  Yonder! Dyer see them ?  Yonder!  Quickly , one after the other , one , two , three , four of the armoured Martians appeared , far away over the little trees , across the flat meadows that stretched towards Chertsey , and striding hurriedly towards the river .  Little cowled figures they seemed at first , going with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds .  Then , advancing obliquely towards us , came a fifth .  Their armoured bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the guns , growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer .  One on the extreme left , the remotest that is , flourished a huge case high in the air , and the ghostly , terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night smote towards Chertsey , and struck the town .  At sight of these strange , swift , and terrible creatures the crowd near the waters edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck . There was no screaming or shouting , but a silence .  Then a hoarse murmur and a movement of feet--a splashing from the water .  A man , too frightened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder , swung round and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden .  A woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me .  I turned with the rush of the people , but I was not too terrified for thought .  The terrible Heat-Ray was in my mind .  To get under water! That was it!  Get under water! I shouted , unheeded .  I faced about again , and rushed towards the approaching Martian , rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water . Others did the same .  A boatload of people putting back came leaping out as I rushed past .  The stones under my feet were muddy and slippery , and the river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-deep .  Then , as the Martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred yards away , I flung myself forward under the surface .  The splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears .  People were landing hastily on both sides of the river .  But the Martian machine took no more notice for the moment of the people running this way and that than a man would of the confusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked .  When , half suffocated , I raised my head above water , the Martians hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river , and as it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generator of the Heat-Ray .  In another moment it was on the bank , and in a stride wading halfway across .  The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank , and in another moment it had raised itself to its full height again , close to the village of Shepperton .  Forthwith the six guns which , unknown to anyone on the right bank , had been hidden behind the outskirts of that village , fired simultaneously .  The sudden near concussion , the last close upon the first , made my heart jump .  The monster was already raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the first shell burst six yards above the hood .  I gave a cry of astonishment .  I saw and thought nothing of the other four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer incident .  Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the body as the hood twisted round in time to receive , but not in time to dodge , the fourth shell .  The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing .  The hood bulged , flashed , was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and glittering metal .  Hit! shouted I , with something between a scream and a cheer .  I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me .  I could have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation .  The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did not fall over .  It recovered its balance by a miracle , and , no longer heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now rigidly upheld , it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton .  The living intelligence , the Martian within the hood , was slain and splashed to the four winds of heaven , and the Thing was now but a mere intricate device of metal whirling to destruction .  It drove along in a straight line , incapable of guidance .  It struck the tower of Shepperton Church , smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have done , swerved aside , blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force into the river out of my sight .  A violent explosion shook the air , and a spout of water , steam , mud , and shattered metal shot far up into the sky .  As the camera of the Heat-Ray hit the water , the latter had immediately flashed into steam .  In another moment a huge wave , like a muddy tidal bore but almost scaldingly hot , came sweeping round the bend upstream .  I saw people struggling shorewards , and heard their screaming and shouting faintly above the seething and roar of the Martians collapse .  For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat , forgot the patent need of self-preservation .  I splashed through the tumultuous water , pushing aside a man in black to do so , until I could see round the bend .  Half a dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves .  The fallen Martian came into sight downstream , lying across the river , and for the most part submerged .  Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage , and through the tumultuously whirling wisps I could see , intermittently and vaguely , the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and spray of mud and froth into the air .  The tentacles swayed and struck like living arms , and , save for the helpless purposelessness of these movements , it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for its life amid the waves .  Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid were spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine .  My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling , like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns .  A man , knee-deep near the towing path , shouted inaudibly to me and pointed .  Looking back , I saw the other Martians advancing with gigantic strides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey . The Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly .  At that I ducked at once under water , and , holding my breath until movement was an agony , blundered painfully ahead under the surface as long as I could .  The water was in a tumult about me , and rapidly growing hotter .  When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the hair and water from my eyes , the steam was rising in a whirling white fog that at first hid the Martians altogether .  The noise was deafening .  Then I saw them dimly , colossal figures of grey , magnified by the mist .  They had passed by me , and two were stooping over the frothing , tumultuous ruins of their comrade .  The third and fourth stood beside him in the water , one perhaps two hundred yards from me , the other towards Laleham .  The generators of the Heat-Rays waved high , and the hissing beams smote down this way and that .  The air was full of sound , a deafening and confusing conflict of noises--the clangorous din of the Martians , the crash of falling houses , the thud of trees , fences , sheds flashing into flame , and the crackling and roaring of fire .  Dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the river , and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white , that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames .  The nearer houses still stood intact , awaiting their fate , shadowy , faint and pallid in the steam , with the fire behind them going to and fro .  For a moment perhaps I stood there , breast-high in the almost boiling water , dumbfounded at my position , hopeless of escape .  Through the reek I could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out of the water through the reeds , like little frogs hurrying through grass from the advance of a man , or running to and fro in utter dismay on the towing path .  Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping towards me .  The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch , and darted out flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar .  The Ray flickered up and down the towing path , licking off the people who ran this way and that , and came down to the waters edge not fifty yards from where I stood .  It swept across the river to Shepperton , and the water in its track rose in a boiling weal crested with steam .  I turned shoreward .  In another moment the huge wave , well-nigh at the boiling-point had rushed upon me .  I screamed aloud , and scalded , half blinded , agonised , I staggered through the leaping , hissing water towards the shore .  Had my foot stumbled , it would have been the end .  I fell helplessly , in full sight of the Martians , upon the broad , bare gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the Wey and Thames . I expected nothing but death .  I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a score of yards of my head , driving straight into the loose gravel , whirling it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense , and then of the four carrying the debris of their comrade between them , now clear and then presently faint through a veil of smoke , receding interminably , as it seemed to me , across a vast space of river and meadow .  And then , very slowly , I realised that by a miracle I had escaped .    CHAPTER THIRTEEN  HOW I FELL IN WITH THE CURATE   After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons , the Martians retreated to their original position upon Horsell Common; and in their haste , and encumbered with the debris of their smashed companion , they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible victim as myself .  Had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith , there was nothing at that time between them and London but batteries of twelve-pounder guns , and they would certainly have reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach; as sudden , dreadful , and destructive their advent would have been as the earthquake that destroyed Lisbon a century ago .  But they were in no hurry .  Cylinder followed cylinder on its interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them reinforcement .  And meanwhile the military and naval authorities , now fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists , worked with furious energy .  Every minute a fresh gun came into position until , before twilight , every copse , every row of suburban villas on the hilly slopes about Kingston and Richmond , masked an expectant black muzzle .  And through the charred and desolated area--perhaps twenty square miles altogether--that encircled the Martian encampment on Horsell Common , through charred and ruined villages among the green trees , through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine spinneys , crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach .  But the Martians now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human proximity , and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder , save at the price of his life .  It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon in going to and fro , transferring everything from the second and third cylinders--the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the third at Pyrford--to their original pit on Horsell Common .  Over that , above the blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide , stood one as sentinel , while the rest abandoned their vast fighting-machines and descended into the pit .  They were hard at work there far into the night , and the towering pillar of dense green smoke that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow , and even , it is said , from Banstead and Epsom Downs .  And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next sally , and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle , I made my way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning Weybridge towards London .  I saw an abandoned boat , very small and remote , drifting down-stream; and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes , I went after it , gained it , and so escaped out of that destruction .  There were no oars in the boat , but I contrived to paddle , as well as my parboiled hands would allow , down the river towards Halliford and Walton , going very tediously and continually looking behind me , as you may well understand .  I followed the river , because I considered that the water gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return .  The hot water from the Martians overthrow drifted downstream with me , so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either bank .  Once , however , I made out a string of black figures hurrying across the meadows from the direction of Weybridge .  Halliford , it seemed , was deserted , and several of the houses facing the river were on fire .  It was strange to see the place quite tranquil , quite desolate under the hot blue sky , with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon .  Never before had I seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd .  A little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing , and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay .  For a long time I drifted , so painful and weary was I after the violence I had been through , and so intense the heat upon the water . Then my fears got the better of me again , and I resumed my paddling . The sun scorched my bare back .  At last , as the bridge at Walton was coming into sight round the bend , my fever and faintness overcame my fears , and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down , deadly sick , amid the long grass .  I suppose the time was then about four or five oclock .  I got up presently , walked perhaps half a mile without meeting a soul , and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge .  I seem to remember talking , wanderingly , to myself during that last spurt .  I was also very thirsty , and bitterly regretful I had drunk no more water .  It is a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I cannot account for it , but my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead worried me excessively .  I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate , so that probably I dozed .  I became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged shirt sleeves , and with his upturned , clean-shaven face staring at a faint flickering that danced over the sky .  The sky was what is called a mackerel sky--rows and rows of faint down-plumes of cloud , just tinted with the midsummer sunset .  I sat up , and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly .  Have you any water ? I asked abruptly .  He shook his head .  You have been asking for water for the last hour , he said .  For a moment we were silent , taking stock of each other .  I dare say he found me a strange enough figure , naked , save for my water-soaked trousers and socks , scalded , and my face and shoulders blackened by the smoke .  His face was a fair weakness , his chin retreated , and his hair lay in crisp , almost flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were rather large , pale blue , and blankly staring . He spoke abruptly , looking vacantly away from me .  What does it mean ? he said .  What do these things mean ?  I stared at him and made no answer .  He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone .  Why are these things permitted ?  What sins have we done ?  The morning service was over , I was walking through the roads to clear my brain for the afternoon , and then--fire , earthquake , death!  As if it were Sodom and Gomorrah!  All our work undone , all the work---- What are these Martians ?  What are we ? I answered , clearing my throat .  He gripped his knees and turned to look at me again .  For half a minute , perhaps , he stared silently .  I was walking through the roads to clear my brain , he said .  And suddenly--fire , earthquake , death!  He relapsed into silence , with his chin now sunken almost to his knees .  Presently he began waving his hand .  All the work--all the Sunday schools--What have we done--what has Weybridge done ?  Everything gone--everything destroyed .  The church! We rebuilt it only three years ago .  Gone!  Swept out of existence! Why ?  Another pause , and he broke out again like one demented .  The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever! he shouted .  His eyes flamed , and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of Weybridge .  By this time I was beginning to take his measure .  The tremendous tragedy in which he had been involved--it was evident he was a fugitive from Weybridge--had driven him to the very verge of his reason .  Are we far from Sunbury ? I said , in a matter-of-fact tone .  What are we to do ? he asked .  Are these creatures everywhere ? Has the earth been given over to them ?  Are we far from Sunbury ?  Only this morning I officiated at early celebration----  Things have changed , I said , quietly .  You must keep your head . There is still hope .  Hope!  Yes .  Plentiful hope--for all this destruction!  I began to explain my view of our position .  He listened at first , but as I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their former stare , and his regard wandered from me .  This must be the beginning of the end , he said , interrupting me . The end!  The great and terrible day of the Lord!  When men shall call upon the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hide them--hide them from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne!  I began to understand the position .  I ceased my laboured reasoning , struggled to my feet , and , standing over him , laid my hand on his shoulder .  Be a man! said I .  You are scared out of your wits!  What good is religion if it collapses under calamity ?  Think of what earthquakes and floods , wars and volcanoes , have done before to men!  Did you think God had exempted Weybridge ?  He is not an insurance agent .  For a time he sat in blank silence .  But how can we escape ? he asked , suddenly .  They are invulnerable , they are pitiless .  Neither the one nor , perhaps , the other , I answered . And the mightier they are the more sane and wary should we be .  One of them was killed yonder not three hours ago .  Killed! he said , staring about him .  How can Gods ministers be killed ?  I saw it happen . I proceeded to tell him .  We have chanced to come in for the thick of it , said I , and that is all .  What is that flicker in the sky ? he asked abruptly .  I told him it was the heliograph signalling--that it was the sign of human help and effort in the sky .  We are in the midst of it , I said , quiet as it is .  That flicker in the sky tells of the gathering storm .  Yonder , I take it are the Martians , and Londonward , where those hills rise about Richmond and Kingston and the trees give cover , earthworks are being thrown up and guns are being placed .  Presently the Martians will be coming this way again .  And even as I spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a gesture .  Listen! he said .  From beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance of distant guns and a remote weird crying .  Then everything was still . A cockchafer came droning over the hedge and past us .  High in the west the crescent moon hung faint and pale above the smoke of Weybridge and Shepperton and the hot , still splendour of the sunset .  We had better follow this path , I said , northward .    CHAPTER FOURTEEN  IN LONDON   My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking . He was a medical student working for an imminent examination , and he heard nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning .  The morning papers on Saturday contained , in addition to lengthy special articles on the planet Mars , on life in the planets , and so forth , a brief and vaguely worded telegram , all the more striking for its brevity .  The Martians , alarmed by the approach of a crowd , had killed a number of people with a quick-firing gun , so the story ran .  The telegram concluded with the words: Formidable as they seem to be , the Martians have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen , and , indeed , seem incapable of doing so .  Probably this is due to the relative strength of the earths gravitational energy .  On that last text their leader-writer expanded very comfortingly .  Of course all the students in the crammers biology class , to which my brother went that day , were intensely interested , but there were no signs of any unusual excitement in the streets .  The afternoon papers puffed scraps of news under big headlines .  They had nothing to tell beyond the movements of troops about the common , and the burning of the pine woods between Woking and Weybridge , until eight .  Then the St . Jamess Gazette , in an extra-special edition , announced the bare fact of the interruption of telegraphic communication .  This was thought to be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the line .  Nothing more of the fighting was known that night , the night of my drive to Leatherhead and back .  My brother felt no anxiety about us , as he knew from the description in the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from my house .  He made up his mind to run down that night to me , in order , as he says , to see the Things before they were killed .  He dispatched a telegram , which never reached me , about four oclock , and spent the evening at a music hall .  In London , also , on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm , and my brother reached Waterloo in a cab .  On the platform from which the midnight train usually starts he learned , after some waiting , that an accident prevented trains from reaching Woking that night .  The nature of the accident he could not ascertain; indeed , the railway authorities did not clearly know at that time .  There was very little excitement in the station , as the officials , failing to realise that anything further than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junction had occurred , were running the theatre trains which usually passed through Woking round by Virginia Water or Guildford .  They were busy making the necessary arrangements to alter the route of the Southampton and Portsmouth Sunday League excursions .  A nocturnal newspaper reporter , mistaking my brother for the traffic manager , to whom he bears a slight resemblance , waylaid and tried to interview him .  Few people , excepting the railway officials , connected the breakdown with the Martians .  I have read , in another account of these events , that on Sunday morning all London was electrified by the news from Woking .  As a matter of fact , there was nothing to justify that very extravagant phrase .  Plenty of Londoners did not hear of the Martians until the panic of Monday morning .  Those who did took some time to realise all that the hastily worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed .  The majority of people in London do not read Sunday papers .  The habit of personal security , moreover , is so deeply fixed in the Londoners mind , and startling intelligence so much a matter of course in the papers , that they could read without any personal tremors: About seven oclock last night the Martians came out of the cylinder , and , moving about under an armour of metallic shields , have completely wrecked Woking station with the adjacent houses , and massacred an entire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment .  No details are known . Maxims have been absolutely useless against their armour; the field guns have been disabled by them .  Flying hussars have been galloping into Chertsey .  The Martians appear to be moving slowly towards Chertsey or Windsor .  Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey , and earthworks are being thrown up to check the advance Londonward .  That was how the Sunday Sun put it , and a clever and remarkably prompt handbook article in the Referee compared the affair to a menagerie suddenly let loose in a village .  No one in London knew positively of the nature of the armoured Martians , and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be sluggish: crawling , creeping painfully--such expressions occurred in almost all the earlier reports .  None of the telegrams could have been written by an eyewitness of their advance .  The Sunday papers printed separate editions as further news came to hand , some even in default of it .  But there was practically nothing more to tell people until late in the afternoon , when the authorities gave the press agencies the news in their possession .  It was stated that the people of Walton and Weybridge , and all the district were pouring along the roads Londonward , and that was all .  My brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning , still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night .  There he heard allusions made to the invasion , and a special prayer for peace .  Coming out , he bought a Referee .  He became alarmed at the news in this , and went again to Waterloo station to find out if communication were restored .  The omnibuses , carriages , cyclists , and innumerable people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected by the strange intelligence that the news venders were disseminating .  People were interested , or , if alarmed , alarmed only on account of the local residents .  At the station he heard for the first time that the Windsor and Chertsey lines were now interrupted . The porters told him that several remarkable telegrams had been received in the morning from Byfleet and Chertsey stations , but that these had abruptly ceased .  My brother could get very little precise detail out of them .  Theres fighting going on about Weybridge was the extent of their information .  The train service was now very much disorganised .  Quite a number of people who had been expecting friends from places on the South-Western network were standing about the station .  One grey-headed old gentleman came and abused the South-Western Company bitterly to my brother .  It wants showing up , he said .  One or two trains came in from Richmond , Putney , and Kingston , containing people who had gone out for a days boating and found the locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air .  A man in a blue and white blazer addressed my brother , full of strange tidings .  Theres hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts and things , with boxes of valuables and all that , he said .  They come from Molesey and Weybridge and Walton , and they say theres been guns heard at Chertsey , heavy firing , and that mounted soldiers have told them to get off at once because the Martians are coming .  We heard guns firing at Hampton Court station , but we thought it was thunder .  What the dickens does it all mean ?  The Martians cant get out of their pit , can they ?  My brother could not tell him .  Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the clients of the underground railway , and that the Sunday excursionists began to return from all over the South-Western lung--Barnes , Wimbledon , Richmond Park , Kew , and so forth--at unnaturally early hours; but not a soul had anything more than vague hearsay to tell of .  Everyone connected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered .  About five oclock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely excited by the opening of the line of communication , which is almost invariably closed , between the South-Eastern and the South-Western stations , and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and carriages crammed with soldiers .  These were the guns that were brought up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston .  There was an exchange of pleasantries: Youll get eaten!  Were the beast-tamers! and so forth .  A little while after that a squad of police came into the station and began to clear the public off the platforms , and my brother went out into the street again .  The church bells were ringing for evensong , and a squad of Salvation Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road .  On the bridge a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the stream in patches .  The sun was just setting , and the Clock Tower and the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most peaceful skies it is possible to imagine , a sky of gold , barred with long transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud .  There was talk of a floating body .  One of the men there , a reservist he said he was , told my brother he had seen the heliograph flickering in the west .  In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who had just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and staring placards .  Dreadful catastrophe! they bawled one to the other down Wellington Street .  Fighting at Weybridge!  Full description!  Repulse of the Martians! London in Danger!  He had to give threepence for a copy of that paper .  Then it was , and then only , that he realised something of the full power and terror of these monsters .  He learned that they were not merely a handful of small sluggish creatures , but that they were minds swaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand against them .  They were described as vast spiderlike machines , nearly a hundred feet high , capable of the speed of an express train , and able to shoot out a beam of intense heat .  Masked batteries , chiefly of field guns , had been planted in the country about Horsell Common , and especially between the Woking district and London .  Five of the machines had been seen moving towards the Thames , and one , by a happy chance , had been destroyed .  In the other cases the shells had missed , and the batteries had been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays .  Heavy losses of soldiers were mentioned , but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic .  The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable .  They had retreated to their triangle of cylinders again , in the circle about Woking .  Signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon them from all sides .  Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor , Portsmouth , Aldershot , Woolwich--even from the north; among others , long wire-guns of ninety-five tons from Woolwich .  Altogether one hundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed , chiefly covering London .  Never before in England had there been such a vast or rapid concentration of military material .  Any further cylinders that fell , it was hoped , could be destroyed at once by high explosives , which were being rapidly manufactured and distributed .  No doubt , ran the report , the situation was of the strangest and gravest description , but the public was exhorted to avoid and discourage panic .  No doubt the Martians were strange and terrible in the extreme , but at the outside there could not be more than twenty of them against our millions .  The authorities had reason to suppose , from the size of the cylinders , that at the outside there could not be more than five in each cylinder--fifteen altogether .  And one at least was disposed of--perhaps more .  The public would be fairly warned of the approach of danger , and elaborate measures were being taken for the protection of the people in the threatened southwestern suburbs .  And so , with reiterated assurances of the safety of London and the ability of the authorities to cope with the difficulty , this quasi-proclamation closed .  This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was still wet , and there had been no time to add a word of comment .  It was curious , my brother said , to see how ruthlessly the usual contents of the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place .  All down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering out the pink sheets and reading , and the Strand was suddenly noisy with the voices of an army of hawkers following these pioneers .  Men came scrambling off buses to secure copies .  Certainly this news excited people intensely , whatever their previous apathy .  The shutters of a map shop in the Strand were being taken down , my brother said , and a man in his Sunday raiment , lemon-yellow gloves even , was visible inside the window hastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass .  Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square , the paper in his hand , my brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey .  There was a man with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in a cart such as greengrocers use .  He was driving from the direction of Westminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five or six respectable-looking people in it , and some boxes and bundles . The faces of these people were haggard , and their entire appearance contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the people on the omnibuses .  People in fashionable clothing peeped at them out of cabs .  They stopped at the Square as if undecided which way to take , and finally turned eastward along the Strand .  Some way behind these came a man in workday clothes , riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles with a small front wheel .  He was dirty and white in the face .  My brother turned down towards Victoria , and met a number of such people .  He had a vague idea that he might see something of me .  He noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic .  Some of the refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses . One was professing to have seen the Martians .  Boilers on stilts , I tell you , striding along like men .  Most of them were excited and animated by their strange experience .  Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with these arrivals .  At all the street corners groups of people were reading papers , talking excitedly , or staring at these unusual Sunday visitors .  They seemed to increase as night drew on , until at last the roads , my brother said , were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day .  My brother addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers from most .  None of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man , who assured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous night .  I come from Byfleet , he said; man on a bicycle came through the place in the early morning , and ran from door to door warning us to come away .  Then came soldiers .  We went out to look , and there were clouds of smoke to the south--nothing but smoke , and not a soul coming that way .  Then we heard the guns at Chertsey , and folks coming from Weybridge .  So Ive locked up my house and come on .  At the time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the invaders without all this inconvenience .  About eight oclock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible all over the south of London .  My brother could not hear it for the traffic in the main thoroughfares , but by striking through the quiet back streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly .  He walked from Westminster to his apartments near Regents Park , about two .  He was now very anxious on my account , and disturbed at the evident magnitude of the trouble .  His mind was inclined to run , even as mine had run on Saturday , on military details .  He thought of all those silent , expectant guns , of the suddenly nomadic countryside; he tried to imagine boilers on stilts a hundred feet high .  There were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along Oxford Street , and several in the Marylebone Road , but so slowly was the news spreading that Regent Street and Portland Place were full of their usual Sunday-night promenaders , albeit they talked in groups , and along the edge of Regents Park there were as many silent couples walking out together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been .  The night was warm and still , and a little oppressive; the sound of guns continued intermittently , and after midnight there seemed to be sheet lightning in the south .  He read and re-read the paper , fearing the worst had happened to me . He was restless , and after supper prowled out again aimlessly .  He returned and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination notes .  He went to bed a little after midnight , and was awakened from lurid dreams in the small hours of Monday by the sound of door knockers , feet running in the street , distant drumming , and a clamour of bells .  Red reflections danced on the ceiling .  For a moment he lay astonished , wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad . Then he jumped out of bed and ran to the window .  His room was an attic and as he thrust his head out , up and down the street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash , and heads in every kind of night disarray appeared .  Enquiries were being shouted .  They are coming! bawled a policeman , hammering at the door; the Martians are coming! and hurried to the next door .  The sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street Barracks , and every church within earshot was hard at work killing sleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin .  There was a noise of doors opening , and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from darkness into yellow illumination .  Up the street came galloping a closed carriage , bursting abruptly into noise at the corner , rising to a clattering climax under the window , and dying away slowly in the distance .  Close on the rear of this came a couple of cabs , the forerunners of a long procession of flying vehicles , going for the most part to Chalk Farm station , where the North-Western special trains were loading up , instead of coming down the gradient into Euston .  For a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank astonishment , watching the policemen hammering at door after door , and delivering their incomprehensible message .  Then the door behind him opened , and the man who lodged across the landing came in , dressed only in shirt , trousers , and slippers , his braces loose about his waist , his hair disordered from his pillow .  What the devil is it ? he asked .  A fire ?  What a devil of a row!  They both craned their heads out of the window , straining to hear what the policemen were shouting .  People were coming out of the side streets , and standing in groups at the corners talking .  What the devil is it all about ? said my brothers fellow lodger .  My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress , running with each garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing excitement .  And presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers came bawling into the street:  London in danger of suffocation!  The Kingston and Richmond defences forced!  Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!  And all about him--in the rooms below , in the houses on each side and across the road , and behind in the Park Terraces and in the hundred other streets of that part of Marylebone , and the Westbourne Park district and St . Pancras , and westward and northward in Kilburn and St . Johns Wood and Hampstead , and eastward in Shoreditch and Highbury and Haggerston and Hoxton , and , indeed , through all the vastness of London from Ealing to East Ham--people were rubbing their eyes , and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions , dressing hastily as the first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew through the streets .  It was the dawn of the great panic .  London , which had gone to bed on Sunday night oblivious and inert , was awakened , in the small hours of Monday morning , to a vivid sense of danger .  Unable from his window to learn what was happening , my brother went down and out into the street , just as the sky between the parapets of the houses grew pink with the early dawn .  The flying people on foot and in vehicles grew more numerous every moment .  Black Smoke! he heard people crying , and again Black Smoke!  The contagion of such a unanimous fear was inevitable .  As my brother hesitated on the door-step , he saw another news vender approaching , and got a paper forthwith .  The man was running away with the rest , and selling his papers for a shilling each as he ran--a grotesque mingling of profit and panic .  And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of the Commander-in-Chief:  The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and poisonous vapour by means of rockets .  They have smothered our batteries , destroyed Richmond , Kingston , and Wimbledon , and are advancing slowly towards London , destroying everything on the way .  It is impossible to stop them .  There is no safety from the Black Smoke but in instant flight .  That was all , but it was enough .  The whole population of the great six-million city was stirring , slipping , running; presently it would be pouring en masse northward .  Black Smoke! the voices cried .  Fire!  The bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult , a cart carelessly driven smashed , amid shrieks and curses , against the water trough up the street .  Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the houses , and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps . And overhead the dawn was growing brighter , clear and steady and calm .  He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms , and up and down stairs behind him .  His landlady came to the door , loosely wrapped in dressing gown and shawl; her husband followed ejaculating .  As my brother began to realise the import of all these things , he turned hastily to his own room , put all his available money--some ten pounds altogether--into his pockets , and went out again into the streets .    CHAPTER FIFTEEN  WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN SURREY   It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford , and while my brother was watching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge , that the Martians had resumed the offensive .  So far as one can ascertain from the conflicting accounts that have been put forth , the majority of them remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine that night , hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of green smoke .  But three certainly came out about eight oclock and , advancing slowly and cautiously , made their way through Byfleet and Pyrford towards Ripley and Weybridge , and so came in sight of the expectant batteries against the setting sun .  These Martians did not advance in a body , but in a line , each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest fellow .  They communicated with one another by means of sirenlike howls , running up and down the scale from one note to another .  It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St . Georges Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford .  The Ripley gunners , unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been placed in such a position , fired one wild , premature , ineffectual volley , and bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village , while the Martian , without using his Heat-Ray , walked serenely over their guns , stepped gingerly among them , passed in front of them , and so came unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park , which he destroyed .  The St . Georges Hill men , however , were better led or of a better mettle .  Hidden by a pine wood as they were , they seem to have been quite unsuspected by the Martian nearest to them .  They laid their guns as deliberately as if they had been on parade , and fired at about a thousand yards range .  The shells flashed all round him , and he was seen to advance a few paces , stagger , and go down .  Everybody yelled together , and the guns were reloaded in frantic haste .  The overthrown Martian set up a prolonged ululation , and immediately a second glittering giant , answering him , appeared over the trees to the south .  It would seem that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells .  The whole of the second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground , and , simultaneously , both his companions brought their Heat-Rays to bear on the battery .  The ammunition blew up , the pine trees all about the guns flashed into fire , and only one or two of the men who were already running over the crest of the hill escaped .  After this it would seem that the three took counsel together and halted , and the scouts who were watching them report that they remained absolutely stationary for the next half hour .  The Martian who had been overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood , a small brown figure , oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of blight , and apparently engaged in the repair of his support .  About nine he had finished , for his cowl was then seen above the trees again .  It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels were joined by four other Martians , each carrying a thick black tube .  A similar tube was handed to each of the three , and the seven proceeded to distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved line between St . Georges Hill , Weybridge , and the village of Send , southwest of Ripley .  A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they began to move , and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton and Esher .  At the same time four of their fighting machines , similarly armed with tubes , crossed the river , and two of them , black against the western sky , came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and painfully along the road that runs northward out of Halliford .  They moved , as it seemed to us , upon a cloud , for a milky mist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height .  At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat , and began running; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian , and I turned aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad ditch by the side of the road .  He looked back , saw what I was doing , and turned to join me .  The two halted , the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury , the remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star , away towards Staines .  The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up their positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute silence .  It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns .  Never since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still .  To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had precisely the same effect--the Martians seemed in solitary possession of the darkling night , lit only as it was by the slender moon , the stars , the afterglow of the daylight , and the ruddy glare from St . Georges Hill and the woods of Painshill .  But facing that crescent everywhere--at Staines , Hounslow , Ditton , Esher , Ockham , behind hills and woods south of the river , and across the flat grass meadows to the north of it , wherever a cluster of trees or village houses gave sufficient cover--the guns were waiting .  The signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and vanished , and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a tense expectation .  The Martians had but to advance into the line of fire , and instantly those motionless black forms of men , those guns glittering so darkly in the early night , would explode into a thunderous fury of battle .  No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant minds , even as it was uppermost in mine , was the riddle--how much they understood of us .  Did they grasp that we in our millions were organized , disciplined , working together ?  Or did they interpret our spurts of fire , the sudden stinging of our shells , our steady investment of their encampment , as we should the furious unanimity of onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees ?  Did they dream they might exterminate us ?  (At that time no one knew what food they needed .)  A hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that vast sentinel shape .  And in the back of my mind was the sense of all the huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward .  Had they prepared pitfalls ? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare ?  Would the Londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of their mighty province of houses ?  Then , after an interminable time , as it seemed to us , crouching and peering through the hedge , came a sound like the distant concussion of a gun .  Another nearer , and then another .  And then the Martian beside us raised his tube on high and discharged it , gunwise , with a heavy report that made the ground heave .  The one towards Staines answered him .  There was no flash , no smoke , simply that loaded detonation .  I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury .  As I did so a second report followed , and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards Hounslow .  I expected at least to see smoke or fire , or some such evidence of its work .  But all I saw was the deep blue sky above , with one solitary star , and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath . And there had been no crash , no answering explosion .  The silence was restored; the minute lengthened to three .  What has happened ? said the curate , standing up beside me .  Heaven knows! said I .  A bat flickered by and vanished .  A distant tumult of shouting began and ceased .  I looked again at the Martian , and saw he was now moving eastward along the riverbank , with a swift , rolling motion .  Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon him; but the evening calm was unbroken .  The figure of the Martian grew smaller as he receded , and presently the mist and the gathering night had swallowed him up .  By a common impulse we clambered higher . Towards Sunbury was a dark appearance , as though a conical hill had suddenly come into being there , hiding our view of the farther country; and then , remoter across the river , over Walton , we saw another such summit .  These hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared .  Moved by a sudden thought , I looked northward , and there I perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen .  Everything had suddenly become very still .  Far away to the southeast , marking the quiet , we heard the Martians hooting to one another , and then the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns .  But the earthly artillery made no reply .  Now at the time we could not understand these things , but later I was to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the twilight .  Each of the Martians , standing in the great crescent I have described , had discharged , by means of the gunlike tube he carried , a huge canister over whatever hill , copse , cluster of houses , or other possible cover for guns , chanced to be in front of him .  Some fired only one of these , some two--as in the case of the one we had seen; the one at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time .  These canisters smashed on striking the ground--they did not explode--and incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy , inky vapour , coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud , a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country .  And the touch of that vapour , the inhaling of its pungent wisps , was death to all that breathes .  It was heavy , this vapour , heavier than the densest smoke , so that , after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact , it sank down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather liquid than gaseous , abandoning the hills , and streaming into the valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do .  And where it came upon water some chemical action occurred , and the surface would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and made way for more .  The scum was absolutely insoluble , and it is a strange thing , seeing the instant effect of the gas , that one could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained . The vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do .  It hung together in banks , flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving reluctantly before the wind , and very slowly it combined with the mist and moisture of the air , and sank to the earth in the form of dust . Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue of the spectrum is concerned , we are still entirely ignorant of the nature of this substance .  Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over , the black smoke clung so closely to the ground , even before its precipitation , that fifty feet up in the air , on the roofs and upper stories of high houses and on great trees , there was a chance of escaping its poison altogether , as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton .  The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the strangeness of its coiling flow , and how he looked down from the church spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its inky nothingness .  For a day and a half he remained there , weary , starving and sun-scorched , the earth under the blue sky and against the prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse , with red roofs , green trees , and , later , black-veiled shrubs and gates , barns , outhouses , and walls , rising here and there into the sunlight .  But that was at Street Cobham , where the black vapour was allowed to remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground .  As a rule the Martians , when it had served its purpose , cleared the air of it again by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it .  This they did with the vapour banks near us , as we saw in the starlight from the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford , whither we had returned .  From there we could see the searchlights on Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill going to and fro , and about eleven the windows rattled , and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in position there .  These continued intermittently for the space of a quarter of an hour , sending chance shots at the invisible Martians at Hampton and Ditton , and then the pale beams of the electric light vanished , and were replaced by a bright red glow .  Then the fourth cylinder fell--a brilliant green meteor--as I learned afterwards , in Bushey Park .  Before the guns on the Richmond and Kingston line of hills began , there was a fitful cannonade far away in the southwest , due , I believe , to guns being fired haphazard before the black vapour could overwhelm the gunners .  So , setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps nest , the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the Londonward country .  The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart , until at last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden . All night through their destructive tubes advanced .  Never once , after the Martian at St . Georges Hill was brought down , did they give the artillery the ghost of a chance against them .  Wherever there was a possibility of guns being laid for them unseen , a fresh canister of the black vapour was discharged , and where the guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray was brought to bear .  By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and the glare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke , blotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as far as the eye could reach .  And through this two Martians slowly waded , and turned their hissing steam jets this way and that .  They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night , either because they had but a limited supply of material for its production or because they did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the opposition they had aroused .  In the latter aim they certainly succeeded .  Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to their movements .  After that no body of men would stand against them , so hopeless was the enterprise .  Even the crews of the torpedo-boats and destroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the Thames refused to stop , mutinied , and went down again .  The only offensive operation men ventured upon after that night was the preparation of mines and pitfalls , and even in that their energies were frantic and spasmodic .  One has to imagine , as well as one may , the fate of those batteries towards Esher , waiting so tensely in the twilight .  Survivors there were none .  One may picture the orderly expectation , the officers alert and watchful , the gunners ready , the ammunition piled to hand , the limber gunners with their horses and waggons , the groups of civilian spectators standing as near as they were permitted , the evening stillness , the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned and wounded from Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the Martians fired , and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields .  One may picture , too , the sudden shifting of the attention , the swiftly spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong , towering heavenward , turning the twilight to a palpable darkness , a strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon its victims , men and horses near it seen dimly , running , shrieking , falling headlong , shouts of dismay , the guns suddenly abandoned , men choking and writhing on the ground , and the swift broadening-out of the opaque cone of smoke .  And then night and extinction--nothing but a silent mass of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead .  Before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of Richmond , and the disintegrating organism of government was , with a last expiring effort , rousing the population of London to the necessity of flight .    CHAPTER SIXTEEN  THE EXODUS FROM LONDON   So you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the greatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning--the stream of flight rising swiftly to a torrent , lashing in a foaming tumult round the railway stations , banked up into a horrible struggle about the shipping in the Thames , and hurrying by every available channel northward and eastward .  By ten oclock the police organisation , and by midday even the railway organisations , were losing coherency , losing shape and efficiency , guttering , softening , running at last in that swift liquefaction of the social body .  All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Eastern people at Cannon Street had been warned by midnight on Sunday , and trains were being filled .  People were fighting savagely for standing-room in the carriages even at two oclock .  By three , people were being trampled and crushed even in Bishopsgate Street , a couple of hundred yards or more from Liverpool Street station; revolvers were fired , people stabbed , and the policemen who had been sent to direct the traffic , exhausted and infuriated , were breaking the heads of the people they were called out to protect .  And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to return to London , the pressure of the flight drove the people in an ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the northward-running roads .  By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes , and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and across the flats of Lambeth , cutting off all escape over the bridges in its sluggish advance .  Another bank drove over Ealing , and surrounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill , alive , but unable to escape .  After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train at Chalk Farm--the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yard there ploughed through shrieking people , and a dozen stalwart men fought to keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his furnace--my brother emerged upon the Chalk Farm road , dodged across through a hurrying swarm of vehicles , and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a cycle shop .  The front tire of the machine he got was punctured in dragging it through the window , but he got up and off , notwithstanding , with no further injury than a cut wrist .  The steep foot of Haverstock Hill was impassable owing to several overturned horses , and my brother struck into Belsize Road .  So he got out of the fury of the panic , and , skirting the Edgware Road , reached Edgware about seven , fasting and wearied , but well ahead of the crowd .  Along the road people were standing in the roadway , curious , wondering .  He was passed by a number of cyclists , some horsemen , and two motor cars .  A mile from Edgware the rim of the wheel broke , and the machine became unridable .  He left it by the roadside and trudged through the village .  There were shops half opened in the main street of the place , and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and windows , staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning .  He succeeded in getting some food at an inn .  For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do .  The flying people increased in number .  Many of them , like my brother , seemed inclined to loiter in the place .  There was no fresh news of the invaders from Mars .  At that time the road was crowded , but as yet far from congested . Most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles , but there were soon motor cars , hansom cabs , and carriages hurrying along , and the dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to St . Albans .  It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford , where some friends of his lived , that at last induced my brother to strike into a quiet lane running eastward .  Presently he came upon a stile , and , crossing it , followed a footpath northeastward .  He passed near several farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn .  He saw few fugitives until , in a grass lane towards High Barnet , he happened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers . He came upon them just in time to save them .  He heard their screams , and , hurrying round the corner , saw a couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in which they had been driving , while a third with difficulty held the frightened ponys head .  One of the ladies , a short woman dressed in white , was simply screaming; the other , a dark , slender figure , slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand .  My brother immediately grasped the situation , shouted , and hurried towards the struggle .  One of the men desisted and turned towards him , and my brother , realising from his antagonists face that a fight was unavoidable , and being an expert boxer , went into him forthwith and sent him down against the wheel of the chaise .  It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet with a kick , and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the slender ladys arm .  He heard the clatter of hoofs , the whip stung across his face , a third antagonist struck him between the eyes , and the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the direction from which he had come .  Partly stunned , he found himself facing the man who had held the horses head , and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the lane , swaying from side to side , and with the women in it looking back .  The man before him , a burly rough , tried to close , and he stopped him with a blow in the face .  Then , realising that he was deserted , he dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise , with the sturdy man close behind him , and the fugitive , who had turned now , following remotely .  Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong , and he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again .  He would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help .  It seems she had had a revolver all this time , but it had been under the seat when she and her companion were attacked .  She fired at six yards distance , narrowly missing my brother .  The less courageous of the robbers made off , and his companion followed him , cursing his cowardice .  They both stopped in sight down the lane , where the third man lay insensible .  Take this! said the slender lady , and she gave my brother her revolver .  Go back to the chaise , said my brother , wiping the blood from his split lip .  She turned without a word--they were both panting--and they went back to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony .  The robbers had evidently had enough of it .  When my brother looked again they were retreating .  Ill sit here , said my brother , if I may; and he got upon the empty front seat .  The lady looked over her shoulder .  Give me the reins , she said , and laid the whip along the ponys side .  In another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my brothers eyes .  So , quite unexpectedly , my brother found himself , panting , with a cut mouth , a bruised jaw , and bloodstained knuckles , driving along an unknown lane with these two women .  He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon living at Stanmore , who had come in the small hours from a dangerous case at Pinner , and heard at some railway station on his way of the Martian advance .  He had hurried home , roused the women--their servant had left them two days before--packed some provisions , put his revolver under the seat--luckily for my brother--and told them to drive on to Edgware , with the idea of getting a train there .  He stopped behind to tell the neighbours .  He would overtake them , he said , at about half past four in the morning , and now it was nearly nine and they had seen nothing of him .  They could not stop in Edgware because of the growing traffic through the place , and so they had come into this side lane .  That was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently they stopped again , nearer to New Barnet .  He promised to stay with them , at least until they could determine what to do , or until the missing man arrived , and professed to be an expert shot with the revolver--a weapon strange to him--in order to give them confidence .  They made a sort of encampment by the wayside , and the pony became happy in the hedge .  He told them of his own escape out of London , and all that he knew of these Martians and their ways .  The sun crept higher in the sky , and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an uneasy state of anticipation .  Several wayfarers came along the lane , and of these my brother gathered such news as he could .  Every broken answer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster that had come on humanity , deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessity for prosecuting this flight .  He urged the matter upon them .  We have money , said the slender woman , and hesitated .  Her eyes met my brothers , and her hesitation ended .  So have I , said my brother .  She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold , besides a five-pound note , and suggested that with that they might get upon a train at St . Albans or New Barnet .  My brother thought that was hopeless , seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains , and broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and thence escaping from the country altogether .  Mrs . Elphinstone--that was the name of the woman in white--would listen to no reasoning , and kept calling upon George; but her sister-in-law was astonishingly quiet and deliberate , and at last agreed to my brothers suggestion .  So , designing to cross the Great North Road , they went on towards Barnet , my brother leading the pony to save it as much as possible .  As the sun crept up the sky the day became excessively hot , and under foot a thick , whitish sand grew burning and blinding , so that they travelled only very slowly .  The hedges were grey with dust .  And as they advanced towards Barnet a tumultuous murmuring grew stronger .  They began to meet more people .  For the most part these were staring before them , murmuring indistinct questions , jaded , haggard , unclean .  One man in evening dress passed them on foot , his eyes on the ground .  They heard his voice , and , looking back at him , saw one hand clutched in his hair and the other beating invisible things .  His paroxysm of rage over , he went on his way without once looking back .  As my brothers party went on towards the crossroads to the south of Barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on their left , carrying a child and with two other children; and then passed a man in dirty black , with a thick stick in one hand and a small portmanteau in the other .  Then round the corner of the lane , from between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high road , came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a sallow youth in a bowler hat , grey with dust .  There were three girls , East End factory girls , and a couple of little children crowded in the cart .  Thisll tike us rahnd Edgware ? asked the driver , wild-eyed , white-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the left , he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks .  My brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the houses in front of them , and veiling the white facade of a terrace beyond the road that appeared between the backs of the villas .  Mrs . Elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot , blue sky .  The tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of many voices , the gride of many wheels , the creaking of waggons , and the staccato of hoofs .  The lane came round sharply not fifty yards from the crossroads .  Good heavens! cried Mrs . Elphinstone .  What is this you are driving us into ?  My brother stopped .  For the main road was a boiling stream of people , a torrent of human beings rushing northward , one pressing on another .  A great bank of dust , white and luminous in the blaze of the sun , made everything within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and of men and women on foot , and by the wheels of vehicles of every description .  Way! my brother heard voices crying .  Make way!  It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire , and the dust was hot and pungent .  And , indeed , a little way up the road a villa was burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to add to the confusion .  Two men came past them .  Then a dirty woman , carrying a heavy bundle and weeping .  A lost retriever dog , with hanging tongue , circled dubiously round them , scared and wretched , and fled at my brothers threat .  So much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses to the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty , hurrying people , pent in between the villas on either side; the black heads , the crowded forms , grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner , hurried past , and merged their individuality again in a receding multitude that was swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust .  Go on!  Go on! cried the voices .  Way!  Way!  One mans hands pressed on the back of another .  My brother stood at the ponys head .  Irresistibly attracted , he advanced slowly , pace by pace , down the lane .  Edgware had been a scene of confusion , Chalk Farm a riotous tumult , but this was a whole population in movement .  It is hard to imagine that host .  It had no character of its own .  The figures poured out past the corner , and receded with their backs to the group in the lane .  Along the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the wheels , stumbling in the ditches , blundering into one another .  The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another , making little way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted forward every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing so , sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the villas .  Push on! was the cry .  Push on!  They are coming!  In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army , gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling , Eternity! Eternity!  His voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother could hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust .  Some of the people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses and quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless , staring at nothing with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst , or lay prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances .  The horses bits were covered with foam , their eyes bloodshot .  There were cabs , carriages , shop cars , waggons , beyond counting; a mail cart , a road-cleaners cart marked Vestry of St . Pancras , a huge timber waggon crowded with roughs .  A brewers dray rumbled by with its two near wheels splashed with fresh blood .  Clear the way! cried the voices .  Clear the way!  Eter-nity!  Eter-nity! came echoing down the road .  There were sad , haggard women tramping by , well dressed , with children that cried and stumbled , their dainty clothes smothered in dust , their weary faces smeared with tears .  With many of these came men , sometimes helpful , sometimes lowering and savage .  Fighting side by side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags , wide-eyed , loud-voiced , and foul-mouthed .  There were sturdy workmen thrusting their way along , wretched , unkempt men , clothed like clerks or shopmen , struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my brother noticed , men dressed in the clothes of railway porters , one wretched creature in a nightshirt with a coat thrown over it .  But varied as its composition was , certain things all that host had in common .  There were fear and pain on their faces , and fear behind them .  A tumult up the road , a quarrel for a place in a waggon , sent the whole host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and broken that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed activity .  The heat and dust had already been at work upon this multitude .  Their skins were dry , their lips black and cracked . They were all thirsty , weary , and footsore .  And amid the various cries one heard disputes , reproaches , groans of weariness and fatigue; the voices of most of them were hoarse and weak .  Through it all ran a refrain:  Way!  Way!  The Martians are coming!  Few stopped and came aside from that flood .  The lane opened slantingly into the main road with a narrow opening , and had a delusive appearance of coming from the direction of London .  Yet a kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of the stream , who for the most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again .  A little way down the lane , with two friends bending over him , lay a man with a bare leg , wrapped about with bloody rags . He was a lucky man to have friends .  A little old man , with a grey military moustache and a filthy black frock coat , limped out and sat down beside the trap , removed his boot--his sock was blood-stained--shook out a pebble , and hobbled on again; and then a little girl of eight or nine , all alone , threw herself under the hedge close by my brother , weeping .  I cant go on!  I cant go on!  My brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up , speaking gently to her , and carried her to Miss Elphinstone .  So soon as my brother touched her she became quite still , as if frightened .  Ellen! shrieked a woman in the crowd , with tears in her voice--Ellen!  And the child suddenly darted away from my brother , crying Mother!  They are coming , said a man on horseback , riding past along the lane .  Out of the way , there! bawled a coachman , towering high; and my brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane .  The people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse .  My brother pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge , and the man drove by and stopped at the turn of the way .  It was a carriage , with a pole for a pair of horses , but only one was in the traces .  My brother saw dimly through the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet hedge .  One of the men came running to my brother .  Where is there any water ? he said .  He is dying fast , and very thirsty .  It is Lord Garrick .  Lord Garrick! said my brother; the Chief Justice ?  The water ? he said .  There may be a tap , said my brother , in some of the houses .  We have no water .  I dare not leave my people .  The man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner house .  Go on! said the people , thrusting at him .  They are coming!  Go on!  Then my brothers attention was distracted by a bearded , eagle-faced man lugging a small handbag , which split even as my brothers eyes rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to break up into separate coins as it struck the ground .  They rolled hither and thither among the struggling feet of men and horses .  The man stopped and looked stupidly at the heap , and the shaft of a cab struck his shoulder and sent him reeling .  He gave a shriek and dodged back , and a cartwheel shaved him narrowly .  Way! cried the men all about him .  Make way!  So soon as the cab had passed , he flung himself , with both hands open , upon the heap of coins , and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket .  A horse rose close upon him , and in another moment , half rising , he had been borne down under the horses hoofs .  Stop! screamed my brother , and pushing a woman out of his way , tried to clutch the bit of the horse .  Before he could get to it , he heard a scream under the wheels , and saw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretchs back .  The driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother , who ran round behind the cart .  The multitudinous shouting confused his ears .  The man was writhing in the dust among his scattered money , unable to rise , for the wheel had broken his back , and his lower limbs lay limp and dead .  My brother stood up and yelled at the next driver , and a man on a black horse came to his assistance .  Get him out of the road , said he; and , clutching the mans collar with his free hand , my brother lugged him sideways .  But he still clutched after his money , and regarded my brother fiercely , hammering at his arm with a handful of gold .  Go on!  Go on! shouted angry voices behind .  Way!  Way!  There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that the man on horseback stopped .  My brother looked up , and the man with the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar .  There was a concussion , and the black horse came staggering sideways , and the carthorse pushed beside it .  A hoof missed my brothers foot by a hairs breadth .  He released his grip on the fallen man and jumped back .  He saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on the ground , and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane , and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it .  He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes , and a little child , with all a childs want of sympathetic imagination , staring with dilated eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still , ground and crushed under the rolling wheels .  Let us go back! he shouted , and began turning the pony round . We cannot cross this--hell , he said and they went back a hundred yards the way they had come , until the fighting crowd was hidden .  As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet , deadly white and drawn , and shining with perspiration .  The two women sat silent , crouching in their seat and shivering .  Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again .  Miss Elphinstone was white and pale , and her sister-in-law sat weeping , too wretched even to call upon George .  My brother was horrified and perplexed . So soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to attempt this crossing .  He turned to Miss Elphinstone , suddenly resolute .  We must go that way , he said , and led the pony round again .  For the second time that day this girl proved her quality .  To force their way into the torrent of people , my brother plunged into the traffic and held back a cab horse , while she drove the pony across its head .  A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter from the chaise .  In another moment they were caught and swept forward by the stream .  My brother , with the cabmans whip marks red across his face and hands , scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her .  Point the revolver at the man behind , he said , giving it to her , if he presses us too hard .  No!--point it at his horse .  Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across the road .  But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition , to become a part of that dusty rout .  They swept through Chipping Barnet with the torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before they had fought across to the opposite side of the way .  It was din and confusion indescribable; but in and beyond the town the road forks repeatedly , and this to some extent relieved the stress .  They struck eastward through Hadley , and there on either side of the road , and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude of people drinking at the stream , some fighting to come at the water .  And farther on , from a lull near East Barnet , they saw two trains running slowly one after the other without signal or order--trains swarming with people , with men even among the coals behind the engines--going northward along the Great Northern Railway . My brother supposes they must have filled outside London , for at that time the furious terror of the people had rendered the central termini impossible .  Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon , for the violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them . They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold , and none of them dared to sleep .  And in the evening many people came hurrying along the road nearby their stopping place , fleeing from unknown dangers before them , and going in the direction from which my brother had come .    CHAPTER SEVENTEEN  THE THUNDER CHILD   Had the Martians aimed only at destruction , they might on Monday have annihilated the entire population of London , as it spread itself slowly through the home counties .  Not only along the road through Barnet , but also through Edgware and Waltham Abbey , and along the roads eastward to Southend and Shoeburyness , and south of the Thames to Deal and Broadstairs , poured the same frantic rout .  If one could have hung that June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above London every northward and eastward road running out of the tangled maze of streets would have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives , each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress .  I have set forth at length in the last chapter my brothers account of the road through Chipping Barnet , in order that my readers may realise how that swarming of black dots appeared to one of those concerned . Never before in the history of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together .  The legendary hosts of Goths and Huns , the hugest armies Asia has ever seen , would have been but a drop in that current .  And this was no disciplined march; it was a stampede--a stampede gigantic and terrible--without order and without a goal , six million people unarmed and unprovisioned , driving headlong .  It was the beginning of the rout of civilisation , of the massacre of mankind .  Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of streets far and wide , houses , churches , squares , crescents , gardens--already derelict--spread out like a huge map , and in the southward blotted .  Over Ealing , Richmond , Wimbledon , it would have seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart . Steadily , incessantly , each black splash grew and spread , shooting out ramifications this way and that , now banking itself against rising ground , now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley , exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper .  And beyond , over the blue hills that rise southward of the river , the glittering Martians went to and fro , calmly and methodically spreading their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over that , laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its purpose , and taking possession of the conquered country .  They do not seem to have aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoralisation and the destruction of any opposition .  They exploded any stores of powder they came upon , cut every telegraph , and wrecked the railways here and there .  They were hamstringing mankind .  They seemed in no hurry to extend the field of their operations , and did not come beyond the central part of London all that day .  It is possible that a very considerable number of people in London stuck to their houses through Monday morning .  Certain it is that many died at home suffocated by the Black Smoke .  Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene . Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there , tempted by the enormous sums of money offered by fugitives , and it is said that many who swam out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and drowned .  About one oclock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridge .  At that the Pool became a scene of mad confusion , fighting , and collision , and for some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in the northern arch of the Tower Bridge , and the sailors and lightermen had to fight savagely against the people who swarmed upon them from the riverfront .  People were actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from above .  When , an hour later , a Martian appeared beyond the Clock Tower and waded down the river , nothing but wreckage floated above Limehouse .  Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell .  The sixth star fell at Wimbledon .  My brother , keeping watch beside the women in the chaise in a meadow , saw the green flash of it far beyond the hills .  On Tuesday the little party , still set upon getting across the sea , made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester . The news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of London was confirmed .  They had been seen at Highgate , and even , it was said , at Neasden .  But they did not come into my brothers view until the morrow .  That day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need of provisions .  As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to be regarded .  Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds , granaries , and ripening root crops with arms in their hands .  A number of people now , like my brother , had their faces eastward , and there were some desperate souls even going back towards London to get food . These were chiefly people from the northern suburbs , whose knowledge of the Black Smoke came by hearsay .  He heard that about half the members of the government had gathered at Birmingham , and that enormous quantities of high explosives were being prepared to be used in automatic mines across the Midland counties .  He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced the desertions of the first days panic , had resumed traffic , and was running northward trains from St . Albans to relieve the congestion of the home counties .  There was also a placard in Chipping Ongar announcing that large stores of flour were available in the northern towns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed among the starving people in the neighbourhood .  But this intelligence did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed , and the three pressed eastward all day , and heard no more of the bread distribution than this promise .  Nor , as a matter of fact , did anyone else hear more of it .  That night fell the seventh star , falling upon Primrose Hill .  It fell while Miss Elphinstone was watching , for she took that duty alternately with my brother .  She saw it .  On Wednesday the three fugitives--they had passed the night in a field of unripe wheat--reached Chelmsford , and there a body of the inhabitants , calling itself the Committee of Public Supply , seized the pony as provisions , and would give nothing in exchange for it but the promise of a share in it the next day .  Here there were rumours of Martians at Epping , and news of the destruction of Waltham Abbey Powder Mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders .  People were watching for Martians here from the church towers .  My brother , very luckily for him as it chanced , preferred to push on at once to the coast rather than wait for food , although all three of them were very hungry .  By midday they passed through Tillingham , which , strangely enough , seemed to be quite silent and deserted , save for a few furtive plunderers hunting for food .  Near Tillingham they suddenly came in sight of the sea , and the most amazing crowd of shipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine .  For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames , they came on to the Essex coast , to Harwich and Walton and Clacton , and afterwards to Foulness and Shoebury , to bring off the people .  They lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last towards the Naze .  Close inshore was a multitude of fishing smacks--English , Scotch , French , Dutch , and Swedish; steam launches from the Thames , yachts , electric boats; and beyond were ships of large burden , a multitude of filthy colliers , trim merchantmen , cattle ships , passenger boats , petroleum tanks , ocean tramps , an old white transport even , neat white and grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; and along the blue coast across the Blackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of boats chaffering with the people on the beach , a swarm which also extended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon .  About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad , very low in the water , almost , to my brothers perception , like a water-logged ship .  This was the ram Thunder Child .  It was the only warship in sight , but far away to the right over the smooth surface of the sea--for that day there was a dead calm--lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next ironclads of the Channel Fleet , which hovered in an extended line , steam up and ready for action , across the Thames estuary during the course of the Martian conquest , vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it .  At the sight of the sea , Mrs . Elphinstone , in spite of the assurances of her sister-in-law , gave way to panic .  She had never been out of England before , she would rather die than trust herself friendless in a foreign country , and so forth .  She seemed , poor woman , to imagine that the French and the Martians might prove very similar . She had been growing increasingly hysterical , fearful , and depressed during the two days journeyings .  Her great idea was to return to Stanmore .  Things had been always well and safe at Stanmore .  They would find George at Stanmore .  It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the beach , where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention of some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames .  They sent a boat and drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three .  The steamer was going , these men said , to Ostend .  It was about two oclock when my brother , having paid their fares at the gangway , found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his charges .  There was food aboard , albeit at exorbitant prices , and the three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward .  There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard , some of whom had expended their last money in securing a passage , but the captain lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon , picking up passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded .  He would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of guns that began about that hour in the south .  As if in answer , the ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags .  A jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels .  Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from Shoeburyness , until it was noticed that it was growing louder .  At the same time , far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea , beneath clouds of black smoke .  But my brothers attention speedily reverted to the distant firing in the south .  He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising out of the distant grey haze .  The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big crescent of shipping , and the low Essex coast was growing blue and hazy , when a Martian appeared , small and faint in the remote distance , advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness .  At that the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and anger at his own delay , and the paddles seemed infected with his terror .  Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the steamer and stared at that distant shape , higher than the trees or church towers inland , and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human stride .  It was the first Martian my brother had seen , and he stood , more amazed than terrified , watching this Titan advancing deliberately towards the shipping , wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell away .  Then , far away beyond the Crouch , came another , striding over some stunted trees , and then yet another , still farther off , wading deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between sea and sky .  They were all stalking seaward , as if to intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between Foulness and the Naze .  In spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the little paddle-boat , and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind her , she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance .  Glancing northwestward , my brother saw the large crescent of shipping already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship passing behind another , another coming round from broadside to end on , steamships whistling and giving off volumes of steam , sails being let out , launches rushing hither and thither .  He was so fascinated by this and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for anything seaward .  And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she had suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong from the seat upon which he was standing .  There was a shouting all about him , a trampling of feet , and a cheer that seemed to be answered faintly .  The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands .  He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard , and not a hundred yards from their heeling , pitching boat , a vast iron bulk like the blade of a plough tearing through the water , tossing it on either side in huge waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer , flinging her paddles helplessly in the air , and then sucking her deck down almost to the waterline .  A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment .  When his eyes were clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward .  Big iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure , and from that twin funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire .  It was the torpedo ram , Thunder Child , steaming headlong , coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping .  Keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks , my brother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again , and he saw the three of them now close together , and standing so far out to sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged . Thus sunken , and seen in remote perspective , they appeared far less formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was pitching so helplessly .  It would seem they were regarding this new antagonist with astonishment .  To their intelligence , it may be , the giant was even such another as themselves .  The Thunder Child fired no gun , but simply drove full speed towards them .  It was probably her not firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did .  They did not know what to make of her .  One shell , and they would have sent her to the bottom forthwith with the Heat-Ray .  She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway between the steamboat and the Martians--a diminishing black bulk against the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast .  Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a canister of the black gas at the ironclad .  It hit her larboard side and glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward , an unfolding torrent of Black Smoke , from which the ironclad drove clear . To the watchers from the steamer , low in the water and with the sun in their eyes , it seemed as though she were already among the Martians .  They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as they retreated shoreward , and one of them raised the camera-like generator of the Heat-Ray .  He held it pointing obliquely downward , and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch .  It must have driven through the iron of the ships side like a white-hot iron rod through paper .  A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam , and then the Martian reeled and staggered .  In another moment he was cut down , and a great body of water and steam shot high in the air .  The guns of the Thunder Child sounded through the reek , going off one after the other , and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer , ricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north , and smashed a smack to matchwood .  But no one heeded that very much .  At the sight of the Martians collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately , and all the crowding passengers on the steamers stern shouted together .  And then they yelled again .  For , surging out beyond the white tumult , drove something long and black , the flames streaming from its middle parts , its ventilators and funnels spouting fire .  She was alive still; the steering gear , it seems , was intact and her engines working .  She headed straight for a second Martian , and was within a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear .  Then with a violent thud , a blinding flash , her decks , her funnels , leaped upward .  The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion , and in another moment the flaming wreckage , still driving forward with the impetus of its pace , had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of cardboard .  My brother shouted involuntarily .  A boiling tumult of steam hid everything again .  Two! yelled the captain .  Everyone was shouting .  The whole steamer from end to end rang with frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea .  The steam hung upon the water for many minutes , hiding the third Martian and the coast altogether .  And all this time the boat was paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last the confusion cleared , the drifting bank of black vapour intervened , and nothing of the Thunder Child could be made out , nor could the third Martian be seen .  But the ironclads to seaward were now quite close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat .  The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward , and the ironclads receded slowly towards the coast , which was hidden still by a marbled bank of vapour , part steam , part black gas , eddying and combining in the strangest way .  The fleet of refugees was scattering to the northeast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the steamboat .  After a time , and before they reached the sinking cloud bank , the warships turned northward , and then abruptly went about and passed into the thickening haze of evening southward .  The coast grew faint , and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that were gathering about the sinking sun .  Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration of guns , and a form of black shadows moving .  Everyone struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west , but nothing was to be distinguished clearly .  A mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun .  The steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense .  The sun sank into grey clouds , the sky flushed and darkened , the evening star trembled into sight .  It was deep twilight when the captain cried out and pointed .  My brother strained his eyes . Something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness--rushed slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad , and very large , that swept round in a vast curve , grew smaller , sank slowly , and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night .  And as it flew it rained down darkness upon the land .    BOOK TWO  THE EARTH UNDER THE MARTIANS    CHAPTER ONE  UNDER FOOT   In the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures to tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two chapters I and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at Halliford whither we fled to escape the Black Smoke .  There I will resume .  We stopped there all Sunday night and all the next day--the day of the panic--in a little island of daylight , cut off by the Black Smoke from the rest of the world .  We could do nothing but wait in aching inactivity during those two weary days .  My mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife .  I figured her at Leatherhead , terrified , in danger , mourning me already as a dead man . I paced the rooms and cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut off from her , of all that might happen to her in my absence .  My cousin I knew was brave enough for any emergency , but he was not the sort of man to realise danger quickly , to rise promptly .  What was needed now was not bravery , but circumspection .  My only consolation was to believe that the Martians were moving London-ward and away from her . Such vague anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful .  I grew very weary and irritable with the curates perpetual ejaculations; I tired of the sight of his selfish despair .  After some ineffectual remonstrance I kept away from him , staying in a room--evidently a childrens schoolroom--containing globes , forms , and copybooks .  When he followed me thither , I went to a box room at the top of the house and , in order to be alone with my aching miseries , locked myself in .  We were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day and the morning of the next .  There were signs of people in the next house on Sunday evening--a face at a window and moving lights , and later the slamming of a door .  But I do not know who these people were , nor what became of them .  We saw nothing of them next day .  The Black Smoke drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning , creeping nearer and nearer to us , driving at last along the roadway outside the house that hid us .  A Martian came across the fields about midday , laying the stuff with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls , smashed all the windows it touched , and scalded the curates hand as he fled out of the front room .  When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked out again , the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had passed over it .  Looking towards the river , we were astonished to see an unaccountable redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows .  For a time we did not see how this change affected our position , save that we were relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke .  But later I perceived that we were no longer hemmed in , that now we might get away .  So soon as I realised that the way of escape was open , my dream of action returned .  But the curate was lethargic , unreasonable .  We are safe here , he repeated; safe here .  I resolved to leave him--would that I had!  Wiser now for the artillerymans teaching , I sought out food and drink .  I had found oil and rags for my burns , and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that I found in one of the bedrooms .  When it was clear to him that I meant to go alone--had reconciled myself to going alone--he suddenly roused himself to come .  And all being quiet throughout the afternoon , we started about five oclock , as I should judge , along the blackened road to Sunbury .  In Sunbury , and at intervals along the road , were dead bodies lying in contorted attitudes , horses as well as men , overturned carts and luggage , all covered thickly with black dust .  That pall of cindery powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii . We got to Hampton Court without misadventure , our minds full of strange and unfamiliar appearances , and at Hampton Court our eyes were relieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating drift .  We went through Bushey Park , with its deer going to and fro under the chestnuts , and some men and women hurrying in the distance towards Hampton , and so we came to Twickenham .  These were the first people we saw .  Away across the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still afire .  Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke , and there were more people about here , though none could give us news . For the most part they were like ourselves , taking advantage of a lull to shift their quarters .  I have an impression that many of the houses here were still occupied by scared inhabitants , too frightened even for flight .  Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the road .  I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap , pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts .  We crossed Richmond Bridge about half past eight .  We hurried across the exposed bridge , of course , but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses , some many feet across .  I did not know what these were--there was no time for scrutiny--and I put a more horrible interpretation on them than they deserved .  Here again on the Surrey side were black dust that had once been smoke , and dead bodies--a heap near the approach to the station; but we had no glimpse of the Martians until we were some way towards Barnes .  We saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a side street towards the river , but otherwise it seemed deserted .  Up the hill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside the town of Richmond there was no trace of the Black Smoke .  Then suddenly , as we approached Kew , came a number of people running , and the upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in sight over the housetops , not a hundred yards away from us .  We stood aghast at our danger , and had the Martian looked down we must immediately have perished .  We were so terrified that we dared not go on , but turned aside and hid in a shed in a garden .  There the curate crouched , weeping silently , and refusing to stir again .  But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest , and in the twilight I ventured out again .  I went through a shrubbery , and along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds , and so emerged upon the road towards Kew .  The curate I left in the shed , but he came hurrying after me .  That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did .  For it was manifest the Martians were about us .  No sooner had the curate overtaken me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen before or another , far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew Lodge .  Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the green-grey of the field , and in a moment it was evident this Martian pursued them .  In three strides he was among them , and they ran radiating from his feet in all directions .  He used no Heat-Ray to destroy them , but picked them up one by one .  Apparently he tossed them into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him , much as a workmans basket hangs over his shoulder .  It was the first time I realised that the Martians might have any other purpose than destruction with defeated humanity .  We stood for a moment petrified , then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled garden , fell into , rather than found , a fortunate ditch , and lay there , scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were out .  I suppose it was nearly eleven oclock before we gathered courage to start again , no longer venturing into the road , but sneaking along hedgerows and through plantations , and watching keenly through the darkness , he on the right and I on the left , for the Martians , who seemed to be all about us .  In one place we blundered upon a scorched and blackened area , now cooling and ashen , and a number of scattered dead bodies of men , burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses , fifty feet , perhaps , behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages .  Sheen , it seemed , had escaped destruction , but the place was silent and deserted .  Here we happened on no dead , though the night was too dark for us to see into the side roads of the place .  In Sheen my companion suddenly complained of faintness and thirst , and we decided to try one of the houses .  The first house we entered , after a little difficulty with the window , was a small semi-detached villa , and I found nothing eatable left in the place but some mouldy cheese .  There was , however , water to drink; and I took a hatchet , which promised to be useful in our next house-breaking .  We then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake . Here there stood a white house within a walled garden , and in the pantry of this domicile we found a store of food--two loaves of bread in a pan , an uncooked steak , and the half of a ham .  I give this catalogue so precisely because , as it happened , we were destined to subsist upon this store for the next fortnight .  Bottled beer stood under a shelf , and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces .  This pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen , and in this was firewood; there was also a cupboard , in which we found nearly a dozen of burgundy , tinned soups and salmon , and two tins of biscuits .  We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark--for we dared not strike a light--and ate bread and ham , and drank beer out of the same bottle . The curate , who was still timorous and restless , was now , oddly enough , for pushing on , and I was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison us .  It cant be midnight yet , I said , and then came a blinding glare of vivid green light .  Everything in the kitchen leaped out , clearly visible in green and black , and vanished again .  And then followed such a concussion as I have never heard before or since .  So close on the heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me , a clash of glass , a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us , and the plaster of the ceiling came down upon us , smashing into a multitude of fragments upon our heads .  I was knocked headlong across the floor against the oven handle and stunned .  I was insensible for a long time , the curate told me , and when I came to we were in darkness again , and he , with a face wet , as I found afterwards , with blood from a cut forehead , was dabbing water over me .  For some time I could not recollect what had happened .  Then things came to me slowly .  A bruise on my temple asserted itself .  Are you better ? asked the curate in a whisper .  At last I answered him .  I sat up .  Dont move , he said .  The floor is covered with smashed crockery from the dresser .  You cant possibly move without making a noise , and I fancy they are outside .  We both sat quite silent , so that we could scarcely hear each other breathing .  Everything seemed deadly still , but once something near us , some plaster or broken brickwork , slid down with a rumbling sound . Outside and very near was an intermittent , metallic rattle .  That! said the curate , when presently it happened again .  Yes , I said .  But what is it ?  A Martian! said the curate .  I listened again .  It was not like the Heat-Ray , I said , and for a time I was inclined to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled against the house , as I had seen one stumble against the tower of Shepperton Church .  Our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or four hours , until the dawn came , we scarcely moved .  And then the light filtered in , not through the window , which remained black , but through a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the wall behind us .  The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the first time .  The window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould , which flowed over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet .  Outside , the soil was banked high against the house .  At the top of the window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe .  The floor was littered with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the house was broken into , and since the daylight shone in there , it was evident the greater part of the house had collapsed .  Contrasting vividly with this ruin was the neat dresser , stained in the fashion , pale green , and with a number of copper and tin vessels below it , the wallpaper imitating blue and white tiles , and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering from the walls above the kitchen range .  As the dawn grew clearer , we saw through the gap in the wall the body of a Martian , standing sentinel , I suppose , over the still glowing cylinder .  At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery .  Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind .  The fifth cylinder , I whispered , the fifth shot from Mars , has struck this house and buried us under the ruins!  For a time the curate was silent , and then he whispered:  God have mercy upon us!  I heard him presently whimpering to himself .  Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my part scarce dared breathe , and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of the kitchen door .  I could just see the curates face , a dim , oval shape , and his collar and cuffs .  Outside there began a metallic hammering , then a violent hooting , and then again , after a quiet interval , a hissing like the hissing of an engine .  These noises , for the most part problematical , continued intermittently , and seemed if anything to increase in number as time wore on .  Presently a measured thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the vessels in the pantry ring and shift , began and continued .  Once the light was eclipsed , and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely dark .  For many hours we must have crouched there , silent and shivering , until our tired attention failed .  .  .  .  At last I found myself awake and very hungry .  I am inclined to believe we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that awakening .  My hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to action .  I told the curate I was going to seek food , and felt my way towards the pantry .  He made me no answer , but so soon as I began eating the faint noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling after me .    CHAPTER TWO  WHAT WE SAW FROM THE RUINED HOUSE   After eating we crept back to the scullery , and there I must have dozed again , for when presently I looked round I was alone .  The thudding vibration continued with wearisome persistence .  I whispered for the curate several times , and at last felt my way to the door of the kitchen .  It was still daylight , and I perceived him across the room , lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the Martians .  His shoulders were hunched , so that his head was hidden from me .  I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed; and the place rocked with that beating thud .  Through the aperture in the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky .  For a minute or so I remained watching the curate , and then I advanced , crouching and stepping with extreme care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor .  I touched the curates leg , and he started so violently that a mass of plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact .  I gripped his arm , fearing he might cry out , and for a long time we crouched motionless .  Then I turned to see how much of our rampart remained .  The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open in the debris , and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet suburban roadway .  Vast , indeed , was the change that we beheld .  The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house we had first visited .  The building had vanished , completely smashed , pulverised , and dispersed by the blow .  The cylinder lay now far beneath the original foundations--deep in a hole , already vastly larger than the pit I had looked into at Woking .  The earth all round it had splashed under that tremendous impact--splashed is the only word--and lay in heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent houses .  It had behaved exactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer .  Our house had collapsed backward; the front portion , even on the ground floor , had been destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen and scullery had escaped , and stood buried now under soil and ruins , closed in by tons of earth on every side save towards the cylinder .  Over that aspect we hung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the Martians were engaged in making .  The heavy beating sound was evidently just behind us , and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil across our peephole .  The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit , and on the farther edge of the pit , amid the smashed and gravel-heaped shrubbery , one of the great fighting-machines , deserted by its occupant , stood stiff and tall against the evening sky .  At first I scarcely noticed the pit and the cylinder , although it has been convenient to describe them first , on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism I saw busy in the excavation , and on account of the strange creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it .  The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first .  It was one of those complicated fabrics that have since been called handling-machines , and the study of which has already given such an enormous impetus to terrestrial invention .  As it dawned upon me first , it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed , agile legs , and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers , bars , and reaching and clutching tentacles about its body .  Most of its arms were retracted , but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of rods , plates , and bars which lined the covering and apparently strengthened the walls of the cylinder .  These , as it extracted them , were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it .  Its motion was so swift , complex , and perfect that at first I did not see it as a machine , in spite of its metallic glitter .  The fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary pitch , but nothing to compare with this .  People who have never seen these structures , and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon , scarcely realise that living quality .  I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war .  The artist had evidently made a hasty study of one of the fighting-machines , and there his knowledge ended .  He presented them as tilted , stiff tripods , without either flexibility or subtlety , and with an altogether misleading monotony of effect .  The pamphlet containing these renderings had a considerable vogue , and I mention them here simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have created .  They were no more like the Martians I saw in action than a Dutch doll is like a human being .  To my mind , the pamphlet would have been much better without them .  At first , I say , the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine , but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument , the controlling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crabs cerebral portion . But then I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown , shiny , leathery integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond , and the true nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me .  With that realisation my interest shifted to those other creatures , the real Martians .  Already I had had a transient impression of these , and the first nausea no longer obscured my observation .  Moreover , I was concealed and motionless , and under no urgency of action .  They were , I now saw , the most unearthly creatures it is possible to conceive .  They were huge round bodies--or , rather , heads--about four feet in diameter , each body having in front of it a face .  This face had no nostrils--indeed , the Martians do not seem to have had any sense of smell , but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes , and just beneath this a kind of fleshy beak .  In the back of this head or body--I scarcely know how to speak of it--was the single tight tympanic surface , since known to be anatomically an ear , though it must have been almost useless in our dense air .  In a group round the mouth were sixteen slender , almost whiplike tentacles , arranged in two bunches of eight each .  These bunches have since been named rather aptly , by that distinguished anatomist , Professor Howes , the hands . Even as I saw these Martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to raise themselves on these hands , but of course , with the increased weight of terrestrial conditions , this was impossible . There is reason to suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon them with some facility .  The internal anatomy , I may remark here , as dissection has since shown , was almost equally simple .  The greater part of the structure was the brain , sending enormous nerves to the eyes , ear , and tactile tentacles .  Besides this were the bulky lungs , into which the mouth opened , and the heart and its vessels .  The pulmonary distress caused by the denser atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin .  And this was the sum of the Martian organs .  Strange as it may seem to a human being , all the complex apparatus of digestion , which makes up the bulk of our bodies , did not exist in the Martians .  They were heads--merely heads .  Entrails they had none .  They did not eat , much less digest .  Instead , they took the fresh , living blood of other creatures , and injected it into their own veins .  I have myself seen this being done , as I shall mention in its place .  But , squeamish as I may seem , I cannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure even to continue watching .  Let it suffice to say , blood obtained from a still living animal , in most cases from a human being , was run directly by means of a little pipette into the recipient canal .  .  .  .  The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us , but at the same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit .  The physiological advantages of the practice of injection are undeniable , if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process .  Our bodies are half made up of glands and tubes and organs , occupied in turning heterogeneous food into blood .  The digestive processes and their reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds .  Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers , or sound gastric glands .  But the Martians were lifted above all these organic fluctuations of mood and emotion .  Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they had brought with them as provisions from Mars .  These creatures , to judge from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands , were bipeds with flimsy , silicious skeletons (almost like those of the silicious sponges) and feeble musculature , standing about six feet high and having round , erect heads , and large eyes in flinty sockets . Two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder , and all were killed before earth was reached .  It was just as well for them , for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every bone in their bodies .  And while I am engaged in this description , I may add in this place certain further details which , although they were not all evident to us at the time , will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them to form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures .  In three other points their physiology differed strangely from ours .  Their organisms did not sleep , any more than the heart of man sleeps .  Since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate , that periodical extinction was unknown to them .  They had little or no sense of fatigue , it would seem .  On earth they could never have moved without effort , yet even to the last they kept in action .  In twenty-four hours they did twenty-four hours of work , as even on earth is perhaps the case with the ants .  In the next place , wonderful as it seems in a sexual world , the Martians were absolutely without sex , and therefore without any of the tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men .  A young Martian , there can now be no dispute , was really born upon earth during the war , and it was found attached to its parent , partially budded off , just as young lilybulbs bud off , or like the young animals in the fresh-water polyp .  In man , in all the higher terrestrial animals , such a method of increase has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the primitive method .  Among the lower animals , up even to those first cousins of the vertebrated animals , the Tunicates , the two processes occur side by side , but finally the sexual method superseded its competitor altogether .  On Mars , however , just the reverse has apparently been the case .  It is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of quasi-scientific repute , writing long before the Martian invasion , did forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martian condition .  His prophecy , I remember , appeared in November or December , 1893 , in a long-defunct publication , the Pall Mall Budget , and I recall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called Punch .  He pointed out--writing in a foolish , facetious tone--that the perfection of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; the perfection of chemical devices , digestion; that such organs as hair , external nose , teeth , ears , and chin were no longer essential parts of the human being , and that the tendency of natural selection would lie in the direction of their steady diminution through the coming ages .  The brain alone remained a cardinal necessity .  Only one other part of the body had a strong case for survival , and that was the hand , teacher and agent of the brain .  While the rest of the body dwindled , the hands would grow larger .  There is many a true word written in jest , and here in the Martians we have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression of the animal side of the organism by the intelligence .  To me it is quite credible that the Martians may be descended from beings not unlike ourselves , by a gradual development of brain and hands (the latter giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last) at the expense of the rest of the body .  Without the body the brain would , of course , become a mere selfish intelligence , without any of the emotional substratum of the human being .  The last salient point in which the systems of these creatures differed from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial particular .  Micro-organisms , which cause so much disease and pain on earth , have either never appeared upon Mars or Martian sanitary science eliminated them ages ago .  A hundred diseases , all the fevers and contagions of human life , consumption , cancers , tumours and such morbidities , never enter the scheme of their life .  And speaking of the differences between the life on Mars and terrestrial life , I may allude here to the curious suggestions of the red weed .  Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars , instead of having green for a dominant colour , is of a vivid blood-red tint .  At any rate , the seeds which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths .  Only that known popularly as the red weed , however , gained any footing in competition with terrestrial forms .  The red creeper was quite a transitory growth , and few people have seen it growing .  For a time , however , the red weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance .  It spread up the sides of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment , and its cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our triangular window .  And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the country , and especially wherever there was a stream of water .  The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ , a single round drum at the back of the head-body , and eyes with a visual range not very different from ours except that , according to Philips , blue and violet were as black to them .  It is commonly supposed that they communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is asserted , for instance , in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet (written evidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions) to which I have already alluded , and which , so far , has been the chief source of information concerning them .  Now no surviving human being saw so much of the Martians in action as I did .  I take no credit to myself for an accident , but the fact is so .  And I assert that I watched them closely time after time , and that I have seen four , five , and (once) six of them sluggishly performing the most elaborately complicated operations together without either sound or gesture .  Their peculiar hooting invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation , and was , I believe , in no sense a signal , but merely the expiration of air preparatory to the suctional operation .  I have a certain claim to at least an elementary knowledge of psychology , and in this matter I am convinced--as firmly as I am convinced of anything--that the Martians interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation . And I have been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions . Before the Martian invasion , as an occasional reader here or there may remember , I had written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory .  The Martians wore no clothing .  Their conceptions of ornament and decorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are , but changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all seriously .  Yet though they wore no clothing , it was in the other artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great superiority over man lay .  We men , with our bicycles and road-skates , our Lilienthal soaring-machines , our guns and sticks and so forth , are just in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have worked out .  They have become practically mere brains , wearing different bodies according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet .  And of their appliances , perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism is absent--the wheel is absent; among all the things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels .  One would have at least expected it in locomotion .  And in this connection it is curious to remark that even on this earth Nature has never hit upon the wheel , or has preferred other expedients to its development .  And not only did the Martians either not know of (which is incredible) , or abstain from , the wheel , but in their apparatus singularly little use is made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot , with circular motions thereabout confined to one plane .  Almost all the joints of the machinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beautifully curved friction bearings .  And while upon this matter of detail , it is remarkable that the long leverages of their machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of the disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn closely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of electricity .  In this way the curious parallelism to animal motions , which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder , was attained .  Such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine which , on my first peeping out of the slit , I watched unpacking the cylinder .  It seemed infinitely more alive than the actual Martians lying beyond it in the sunset light , panting , stirring ineffectual tentacles , and moving feebly after their vast journey across space .  While I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight , and noting each strange detail of their form , the curate reminded me of his presence by pulling violently at my arm .  I turned to a scowling face , and silent , eloquent lips .  He wanted the slit , which permitted only one of us to peep through; and so I had to forego watching them for a time while he enjoyed that privilege .  When I looked again , the busy handling-machine had already put together several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinder into a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and down on the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view , emitting jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit , excavating and embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner . This it was which had caused the regular beating noise , and the rhythmic shocks that had kept our ruinous refuge quivering .  It piped and whistled as it worked .  So far as I could see , the thing was without a directing Martian at all .    CHAPTER THREE  THE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT   The arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole into the scullery , for we feared that from his elevation the Martian might see down upon us behind our barrier .  At a later date we began to feel less in danger of their eyes , for to an eye in the dazzle of the sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness , but at first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery in heart-throbbing retreat .  Yet terrible as was the danger we incurred , the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible . And I recall now with a sort of wonder that , in spite of the infinite danger in which we were between starvation and a still more terrible death , we could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight .  We would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and the dread of making a noise , and strike each other , and thrust and kick , within a few inches of exposure .  The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and habits of thought and action , and our danger and isolation only accentuated the incompatibility .  At Halliford I had already come to hate the curates trick of helpless exclamation , his stupid rigidity of mind .  His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made to think out a line of action , and drove me at times , thus pent up and intensified , almost to the verge of craziness .  He was as lacking in restraint as a silly woman .  He would weep for hours together , and I verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought his weak tears in some way efficacious .  And I would sit in the darkness unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his importunities .  He ate more than I did , and it was in vain I pointed out that our only chance of life was to stop in the house until the Martians had done with their pit , that in that long patience a time might presently come when we should need food .  He ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at long intervals .  He slept little .  As the days wore on , his utter carelessness of any consideration so intensified our distress and danger that I had , much as I loathed doing it , to resort to threats , and at last to blows .  That brought him to reason for a time .  But he was one of those weak creatures , void of pride , timorous , anaemic , hateful souls , full of shifty cunning , who face neither God nor man , who face not even themselves .  It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things , but I set them down that my story may lack nothing .  Those who have escaped the dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality , my flash of rage in our final tragedy , easy enough to blame; for they know what is wrong as well as any , but not what is possible to tortured men .  But those who have been under the shadow , who have gone down at last to elemental things , will have a wider charity .  And while within we fought out our dark , dim contest of whispers , snatched food and drink , and gripping hands and blows , without , in the pitiless sunlight of that terrible June , was the strange wonder , the unfamiliar routine of the Martians in the pit .  Let me return to those first new experiences of mine .  After a long time I ventured back to the peephole , to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by the occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-machines .  These last had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an orderly manner about the cylinder .  The second handling-machine was now completed , and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the big machine had brought .  This was a body resembling a milk can in its general form , above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle , and from which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin below .  The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the handling-machine .  With two spatulate hands the handling-machine was digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle above , while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine .  Another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the mound of bluish dust .  From this unseen receiver a little thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air .  As I looked , the handling-machine , with a faint and musical clinking , extended , telescopic fashion , a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere blunt projection , until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay . In another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight , untarnished as yet , and shining dazzlingly , and deposited it in a growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit .  Between sunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a hundred such bars out of the crude clay , and the mound of bluish dust rose steadily until it topped the side of the pit .  The contrast between the swift and complex movements of these contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was acute , and for days I had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter were indeed the living of the two things .  The curate had possession of the slit when the first men were brought to the pit .  I was sitting below , huddled up , listening with all my ears .  He made a sudden movement backward , and I , fearful that we were observed , crouched in a spasm of terror .  He came sliding down the rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness , inarticulate , gesticulating , and for a moment I shared his panic .  His gesture suggested a resignation of the slit , and after a little while my curiosity gave me courage , and I rose up , stepped across him , and clambered up to it .  At first I could see no reason for his frantic behaviour .  The twilight had now come , the stars were little and faint , but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from the aluminium-making .  The whole picture was a flickering scheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows , strangely trying to the eyes .  Over and through it all went the bats , heeding it not at all .  The sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen , the mound of blue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight , and a fighting-machine , with its legs contracted , crumpled , and abbreviated , stood across the corner of the pit .  And then , amid the clangour of the machinery , came a drifting suspicion of human voices , that I entertained at first only to dismiss .  I crouched , watching this fighting-machine closely , satisfying myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a Martian .  As the green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of his integument and the brightness of his eyes .  And suddenly I heard a yell , and saw a long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the machine to the little cage that hunched upon its back .  Then something--something struggling violently--was lifted high against the sky , a black , vague enigma against the starlight; and as this black object came down again , I saw by the green brightness that it was a man .  For an instant he was clearly visible .  He was a stout , ruddy , middle-aged man , well dressed; three days before , he must have been walking the world , a man of considerable consequence .  I could see his staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch chain .  He vanished behind the mound , and for a moment there was silence .  And then began a shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from the Martians .  I slid down the rubbish , struggled to my feet , clapped my hands over my ears , and bolted into the scullery .  The curate , who had been crouching silently with his arms over his head , looked up as I passed , cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him , and came running after me .  That night , as we lurked in the scullery , balanced between our horror and the terrible fascination this peeping had , although I felt an urgent need of action I tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape; but afterwards , during the second day , I was able to consider our position with great clearness .  The curate , I found , was quite incapable of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him of all vestiges of reason or forethought .  Practically he had already sunk to the level of an animal .  But as the saying goes , I gripped myself with both hands .  It grew upon my mind , once I could face the facts , that terrible as our position was , there was as yet no justification for absolute despair .  Our chief chance lay in the possibility of the Martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment .  Or even if they kept it permanently , they might not consider it necessary to guard it , and a chance of escape might be afforded us .  I also weighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out in a direction away from the pit , but the chances of our emerging within sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great .  And I should have had to do all the digging myself . The curate would certainly have failed me .  It was on the third day , if my memory serves me right , that I saw the lad killed .  It was the only occasion on which I actually saw the Martians feed .  After that experience I avoided the hole in the wall for the better part of a day .  I went into the scullery , removed the door , and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible; but when I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the loose earth collapsed noisily , and I did not dare continue .  I lost heart , and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time , having no spirit even to move .  And after that I abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by excavation .  It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that at first I entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought about by their overthrow through any human effort .  But on the fourth or fifth night I heard a sound like heavy guns .  It was very late in the night , and the moon was shining brightly . The Martians had taken away the excavating-machine , and , save for a fighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a handling-machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit immediately beneath my peephole , the place was deserted by them . Except for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and patches of white moonlight the pit was in darkness , and , except for the clinking of the handling-machine , quite still .  That night was a beautiful serenity; save for one planet , the moon seemed to have the sky to herself .  I heard a dog howling , and that familiar sound it was that made me listen .  Then I heard quite distinctly a booming exactly like the sound of great guns .  Six distinct reports I counted , and after a long interval six again .  And that was all .    CHAPTER FOUR  THE DEATH OF THE CURATE   It was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped for the last time , and presently found myself alone .  Instead of keeping close to me and trying to oust me from the slit , the curate had gone back into the scullery .  I was struck by a sudden thought .  I went back quickly and quietly into the scullery .  In the darkness I heard the curate drinking .  I snatched in the darkness , and my fingers caught a bottle of burgundy .  For a few minutes there was a tussle .  The bottle struck the floor and broke , and I desisted and rose .  We stood panting and threatening each other .  In the end I planted myself between him and the food , and told him of my determination to begin a discipline .  I divided the food in the pantry , into rations to last us ten days .  I would not let him eat any more that day .  In the afternoon he made a feeble effort to get at the food .  I had been dozing , but in an instant I was awake . All day and all night we sat face to face , I weary but resolute , and he weeping and complaining of his immediate hunger .  It was , I know , a night and a day , but to me it seemed--it seems now--an interminable length of time .  And so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict . For two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests . There were times when I beat and kicked him madly , times when I cajoled and persuaded him , and once I tried to bribe him with the last bottle of burgundy , for there was a rain-water pump from which I could get water .  But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed beyond reason .  He would neither desist from his attacks on the food nor from his noisy babbling to himself .  The rudimentary precautions to keep our imprisonment endurable he would not observe .  Slowly I began to realise the complete overthrow of his intelligence , to perceive that my sole companion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane .  From certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mind wandered at times .  I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept . It sounds paradoxical , but I am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity of the curate warned me , braced me , and kept me a sane man .  On the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering , and nothing I could do would moderate his speech .  It is just , O God! he would say , over and over again . It is just .  On me and mine be the punishment laid .  We have sinned , we have fallen short .  There was poverty , sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust , and I held my peace .  I preached acceptable folly--my God , what folly!--when I should have stood up , though I died for it , and called upon them to repent--repent!  .  .  .  Oppressors of the poor and needy  .  .  . !  The wine press of God!  Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheld from him , praying , begging , weeping , at last threatening .  He began to raise his voice--I prayed him not to .  He perceived a hold on me--he threatened he would shout and bring the Martians upon us .  For a time that scared me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape beyond estimating .  I defied him , although I felt no assurance that he might not do this thing .  But that day , at any rate , he did not .  He talked with his voice rising slowly , through the greater part of the eighth and ninth days--threats , entreaties , mingled with a torrent of half-sane and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of Gods service , such as made me pity him .  Then he slept awhile , and began again with renewed strength , so loudly that I must needs make him desist .  Be still! I implored .  He rose to his knees , for he had been sitting in the darkness near the copper .  I have been still too long , he said , in a tone that must have reached the pit , and now I must bear my witness .  Woe unto this unfaithful city!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe!  Woe! To the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet----  Shut up! I said , rising to my feet , and in a terror lest the Martians should hear us .  For Gods sake----  Nay , shouted the curate , at the top of his voice , standing likewise and extending his arms .  Speak!  The word of the Lord is upon me!  In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen .  I must bear my witness!  I go!  It has already been too long delayed .  I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall . In a flash I was after him .  I was fierce with fear .  Before he was halfway across the kitchen I had overtaken him .  With one last touch of humanity I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt .  He went headlong forward and lay stretched on the ground .  I stumbled over him and stood panting .  He lay still .  Suddenly I heard a noise without , the run and smash of slipping plaster , and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened .  I looked up and saw the lower surface of a handling-machine coming slowly across the hole .  One of its gripping limbs curled amid the debris; another limb appeared , feeling its way over the fallen beams . I stood petrified , staring .  Then I saw through a sort of glass plate near the edge of the body the face , as we may call it , and the large dark eyes of a Martian , peering , and then a long metallic snake of tentacle came feeling slowly through the hole .  I turned by an effort , stumbled over the curate , and stopped at the scullery door .  The tentacle was now some way , two yards or more , in the room , and twisting and turning , with queer sudden movements , this way and that .  For a while I stood fascinated by that slow , fitful advance .  Then , with a faint , hoarse cry , I forced myself across the scullery .  I trembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright .  I opened the door of the coal cellar , and stood there in the darkness staring at the faintly lit doorway into the kitchen , and listening . Had the Martian seen me ?  What was it doing now ?  Something was moving to and fro there , very quietly; every now and then it tapped against the wall , or started on its movements with a faint metallic ringing , like the movements of keys on a split-ring . Then a heavy body--I knew too well what--was dragged across the floor of the kitchen towards the opening .  Irresistibly attracted , I crept to the door and peeped into the kitchen .  In the triangle of bright outer sunlight I saw the Martian , in its Briareus of a handling-machine , scrutinizing the curates head .  I thought at once that it would infer my presence from the mark of the blow I had given him .  I crept back to the coal cellar , shut the door , and began to cover myself up as much as I could , and as noiselessly as possible in the darkness , among the firewood and coal therein .  Every now and then I paused , rigid , to hear if the Martian had thrust its tentacles through the opening again .  Then the faint metallic jingle returned .  I traced it slowly feeling over the kitchen .  Presently I heard it nearer--in the scullery , as I judged .  I thought that its length might be insufficient to reach me .  I prayed copiously .  It passed , scraping faintly across the cellar door .  An age of almost intolerable suspense intervened; then I heard it fumbling at the latch! It had found the door!  The Martians understood doors!  It worried at the catch for a minute , perhaps , and then the door opened .  In the darkness I could just see the thing--like an elephants trunk more than anything else--waving towards me and touching and examining the wall , coals , wood and ceiling .  It was like a black worm swaying its blind head to and fro .  Once , even , it touched the heel of my boot .  I was on the verge of screaming; I bit my hand .  For a time the tentacle was silent .  I could have fancied it had been withdrawn .  Presently , with an abrupt click , it gripped something--I thought it had me!--and seemed to go out of the cellar again .  For a minute I was not sure .  Apparently it had taken a lump of coal to examine .  I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position , which had become cramped , and then listened .  I whispered passionate prayers for safety .  Then I heard the slow , deliberate sound creeping towards me again . Slowly , slowly it drew near , scratching against the walls and tapping the furniture .  While I was still doubtful , it rapped smartly against the cellar door and closed it .  I heard it go into the pantry , and the biscuit-tins rattled and a bottle smashed , and then came a heavy bump against the cellar door .  Then silence that passed into an infinity of suspense .  Had it gone ?  At last I decided that it had .  It came into the scullery no more; but I lay all the tenth day in the close darkness , buried among coals and firewood , not daring even to crawl out for the drink for which I craved .  It was the eleventh day before I ventured so far from my security .    CHAPTER FIVE  THE STILLNESS   My first act before I went into the pantry was to fasten the door between the kitchen and the scullery .  But the pantry was empty; every scrap of food had gone .  Apparently , the Martian had taken it all on the previous day .  At that discovery I despaired for the first time .  I took no food , or no drink either , on the eleventh or the twelfth day .  At first my mouth and throat were parched , and my strength ebbed sensibly .  I sat about in the darkness of the scullery , in a state of despondent wretchedness .  My mind ran on eating .  I thought I had become deaf , for the noises of movement I had been accustomed to hear from the pit had ceased absolutely .  I did not feel strong enough to crawl noiselessly to the peephole , or I would have gone there .  On the twelfth day my throat was so painful that , taking the chance of alarming the Martians , I attacked the creaking rain-water pump that stood by the sink , and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and tainted rain water .  I was greatly refreshed by this , and emboldened by the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping .  During these days , in a rambling , inconclusive way , I thought much of the curate and of the manner of his death .  On the thirteenth day I drank some more water , and dozed and thought disjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of escape .  Whenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible phantasms , of the death of the curate , or of sumptuous dinners; but , asleep or awake , I felt a keen pain that urged me to drink again and again .  The light that came into the scullery was no longer grey , but red .  To my disordered imagination it seemed the colour of blood .  On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen , and I was surprised to find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in the wall , turning the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured obscurity .  It was early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious , familiar sequence of sounds in the kitchen , and , listening , identified it as the snuffing and scratching of a dog .  Going into the kitchen , I saw a dogs nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds .  This greatly surprised me .  At the scent of me he barked shortly .  I thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly I should be able , perhaps , to kill and eat him; and in any case , it would be advisable to kill him , lest his actions attracted the attention of the Martians .  I crept forward , saying Good dog! very softly; but he suddenly withdrew his head and disappeared .  I listened--I was not deaf--but certainly the pit was still .  I heard a sound like the flutter of a birds wings , and a hoarse croaking , but that was all .  For a long while I lay close to the peephole , but not daring to move aside the red plants that obscured it .  Once or twice I heard a faint pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither on the sand far below me , and there were more birdlike sounds , but that was all .  At length , encouraged by the silence , I looked out .  Except in the corner , where a multitude of crows hopped and fought over the skeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed , there was not a living thing in the pit .  I stared about me , scarcely believing my eyes .  All the machinery had gone .  Save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one corner , certain bars of aluminium in another , the black birds , and the skeletons of the killed , the place was merely an empty circular pit in the sand .  Slowly I thrust myself out through the red weed , and stood upon the mound of rubble .  I could see in any direction save behind me , to the north , and neither Martians nor sign of Martians were to be seen .  The pit dropped sheerly from my feet , but a little way along the rubbish afforded a practicable slope to the summit of the ruins .  My chance of escape had come .  I began to tremble .  I hesitated for some time , and then , in a gust of desperate resolution , and with a heart that throbbed violently , I scrambled to the top of the mound in which I had been buried so long .  I looked about again .  To the northward , too , no Martian was visible .  When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight it had been a straggling street of comfortable white and red houses , interspersed with abundant shady trees .  Now I stood on a mound of smashed brickwork , clay , and gravel , over which spread a multitude of red cactus-shaped plants , knee-high , without a solitary terrestrial growth to dispute their footing .  The trees near me were dead and brown , but further a network of red thread scaled the still living stems .  The neighbouring houses had all been wrecked , but none had been burned; their walls stood , sometimes to the second story , with smashed windows and shattered doors .  The red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless rooms .  Below me was the great pit , with the crows struggling for its refuse .  A number of other birds hopped about among the ruins . Far away I saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall , but traces of men there were none .  The day seemed , by contrast with my recent confinement , dazzlingly bright , the sky a glowing blue .  A gentle breeze kept the red weed that covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying .  And oh! the sweetness of the air!    CHAPTER SIX  THE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS   For some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of my safety .  Within that noisome den from which I had emerged I had thought with a narrow intensity only of our immediate security .  I had not realised what had been happening to the world , had not anticipated this startling vision of unfamiliar things .  I had expected to see Sheen in ruins--I found about me the landscape , weird and lurid , of another planet .  For that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common range of men , yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well .  I felt as a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations of a house .  I felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew quite clear in my mind , that oppressed me for many days , a sense of dethronement , a persuasion that I was no longer a master , but an animal among the animals , under the Martian heel .  With us it would be as with them , to lurk and watch , to run and hide; the fear and empire of man had passed away .  But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed , and my dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast .  In the direction away from the pit I saw , beyond a red-covered wall , a patch of garden ground unburied .  This gave me a hint , and I went knee-deep , and sometimes neck-deep , in the red weed .  The density of the weed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding .  The wall was some six feet high , and when I attempted to clamber it I found I could not lift my feet to the crest .  So I went along by the side of it , and came to a corner and a rockwork that enabled me to get to the top , and tumble into the garden I coveted .  Here I found some young onions , a couple of gladiolus bulbs , and a quantity of immature carrots , all of which I secured , and , scrambling over a ruined wall , went on my way through scarlet and crimson trees towards Kew--it was like walking through an avenue of gigantic blood drops--possessed with two ideas: to get more food , and to limp , as soon and as far as my strength permitted , out of this accursed unearthly region of the pit .  Some way farther , in a grassy place , was a group of mushrooms which also I devoured , and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow water , where meadows used to be .  These fragments of nourishment served only to whet my hunger .  At first I was surprised at this flood in a hot , dry summer , but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the tropical exuberance of the red weed .  Directly this extraordinary growth encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of unparalleled fecundity .  Its seeds were simply poured down into the water of the Wey and Thames , and its swiftly growing and Titanic water fronds speedily choked both those rivers .  At Putney , as I afterwards saw , the bridge was almost lost in a tangle of this weed , and at Richmond , too , the Thames water poured in a broad and shallow stream across the meadows of Hampton and Twickenham .  As the water spread the weed followed them , until the ruined villas of the Thames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp , whose margin I explored , and much of the desolation the Martians had caused was concealed .  In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread .  A cankering disease , due , it is believed , to the action of certain bacteria , presently seized upon it .  Now by the action of natural selection , all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power against bacterial diseases--they never succumb without a severe struggle , but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead .  The fronds became bleached , and then shrivelled and brittle .  They broke off at the least touch , and the waters that had stimulated their early growth carried their last vestiges out to sea .  My first act on coming to this water was , of course , to slake my thirst .  I drank a great deal of it and , moved by an impulse , gnawed some fronds of red weed; but they were watery , and had a sickly , metallic taste .  I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to wade securely , although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the flood evidently got deeper towards the river , and I turned back to Mortlake .  I managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins of its villas and fences and lamps , and so presently I got out of this spate and made my way to the hill going up towards Roehampton and came out on Putney Common .  Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation of a cyclone , and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectly undisturbed spaces , houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors closed , as if they had been left for a day by the owners , or as if their inhabitants slept within .  The red weed was less abundant; the tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper .  I hunted for food among the trees , finding nothing , and I also raided a couple of silent houses , but they had already been broken into and ransacked . I rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery , being , in my enfeebled condition , too fatigued to push on .  All this time I saw no human beings , and no signs of the Martians . I encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs , but both hurried circuitously away from the advances I made them .  Near Roehampton I had seen two human skeletons--not bodies , but skeletons , picked clean--and in the wood by me I found the crushed and scattered bones of several cats and rabbits and the skull of a sheep .  But though I gnawed parts of these in my mouth , there was nothing to be got from them .  After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney , where I think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason .  And in the garden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes , sufficient to stay my hunger .  From this garden one looked down upon Putney and the river .  The aspect of the place in the dusk was singularly desolate: blackened trees , blackened , desolate ruins , and down the hill the sheets of the flooded river , red-tinged with the weed .  And over all--silence .  It filled me with indescribable terror to think how swiftly that desolating change had come .  For a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence , and that I stood there alone , the last man left alive .  Hard by the top of Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton , with the arms dislocated and removed several yards from the rest of the body .  As I proceeded I became more and more convinced that the extermination of mankind was , save for such stragglers as myself , already accomplished in this part of the world .  The Martians , I thought , had gone on and left the country desolated , seeking food elsewhere .  Perhaps even now they were destroying Berlin or Paris , or it might be they had gone northward .    CHAPTER SEVEN  THE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL   I spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney Hill , sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to Leatherhead .  I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into that house--afterwards I found the front door was on the latch--nor how I ransacked every room for food , until just on the verge of despair , in what seemed to me to be a servants bedroom , I found a rat-gnawed crust and two tins of pineapple .  The place had been already searched and emptied .  In the bar I afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches that had been overlooked .  The latter I could not eat , they were too rotten , but the former not only stayed my hunger , but filled my pockets .  I lit no lamps , fearing some Martian might come beating that part of London for food in the night .  Before I went to bed I had an interval of restlessness , and prowled from window to window , peering out for some sign of these monsters .  I slept little .  As I lay in bed I found myself thinking consecutively--a thing I do not remember to have done since my last argument with the curate .  During all the intervening time my mental condition had been a hurrying succession of vague emotional states or a sort of stupid receptivity .  But in the night my brain , reinforced , I suppose , by the food I had eaten , grew clear again , and I thought .  Three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of the curate , the whereabouts of the Martians , and the possible fate of my wife .  The former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to recall; I saw it simply as a thing done , a memory infinitely disagreeable but quite without the quality of remorse .  I saw myself then as I see myself now , driven step by step towards that hasty blow , the creature of a sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that .  I felt no condemnation; yet the memory , static , unprogressive , haunted me .  In the silence of the night , with that sense of the nearness of God that sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness , I stood my trial , my only trial , for that moment of wrath and fear .  I retraced every step of our conversation from the moment when I had found him crouching beside me , heedless of my thirst , and pointing to the fire and smoke that streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge .  We had been incapable of co-operation--grim chance had taken no heed of that .  Had I foreseen , I should have left him at Halliford .  But I did not foresee; and crime is to foresee and do .  And I set this down as I have set all this story down , as it was .  There were no witnesses--all these things I might have concealed .  But I set it down , and the reader must form his judgment as he will .  And when , by an effort , I had set aside that picture of a prostrate body , I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife .  For the former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred things , and so , unhappily , I could for the latter .  And suddenly that night became terrible .  I found myself sitting up in bed , staring at the dark .  I found myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and painlessly struck her out of being .  Since the night of my return from Leatherhead I had not prayed .  I had uttered prayers , fetish prayers , had prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now I prayed indeed , pleading steadfastly and sanely , face to face with the darkness of God .  Strange night!  Strangest in this , that so soon as dawn had come , I , who had talked with God , crept out of the house like a rat leaving its hiding place--a creature scarcely larger , an inferior animal , a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be hunted and killed .  Perhaps they also prayed confidently to God .  Surely , if we have learned nothing else , this war has taught us pity--pity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion .  The morning was bright and fine , and the eastern sky glowed pink , and was fretted with little golden clouds .  In the road that runs from the top of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of the panic torrent that must have poured Londonward on the Sunday night after the fighting began .  There was a little two-wheeled cart inscribed with the name of Thomas Lobb , Greengrocer , New Malden , with a smashed wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat trampled into the now hardened mud , and at the top of West Hill a lot of blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough .  My movements were languid , my plans of the vaguest .  I had an idea of going to Leatherhead , though I knew that there I had the poorest chance of finding my wife .  Certainly , unless death had overtaken them suddenly , my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to me I might find or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled .  I knew I wanted to find my wife , that my heart ached for her and the world of men , but I had no clear idea how the finding might be done .  I was also sharply aware now of my intense loneliness .  From the corner I went , under cover of a thicket of trees and bushes , to the edge of Wimbledon Common , stretching wide and far .  That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom; there was no red weed to be seen , and as I prowled , hesitating , on the verge of the open , the sun rose , flooding it all with light and vitality .  I came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place among the trees .  I stopped to look at them , drawing a lesson from their stout resolve to live .  And presently , turning suddenly , with an odd feeling of being watched , I beheld something crouching amid a clump of bushes .  I stood regarding this .  I made a step towards it , and it rose up and became a man armed with a cutlass .  I approached him slowly .  He stood silent and motionless , regarding me .  As I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and filthy as my own; he looked , indeed , as though he had been dragged through a culvert .  Nearer , I distinguished the green slime of ditches mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny , coaly patches .  His black hair fell over his eyes , and his face was dark and dirty and sunken , so that at first I did not recognise him .  There was a red cut across the lower part of his face .  Stop! he cried , when I was within ten yards of him , and I stopped .  His voice was hoarse .  Where do you come from ? he said .  I thought , surveying him .  I come from Mortlake , I said .  I was buried near the pit the Martians made about their cylinder .  I have worked my way out and escaped .  There is no food about here , he said .  This is my country .  All this hill down to the river , and back to Clapham , and up to the edge of the common .  There is only food for one .  Which way are you going ?  I answered slowly .  I dont know , I said .  I have been buried in the ruins of a house thirteen or fourteen days .  I dont know what has happened .  He looked at me doubtfully , then started , and looked with a changed expression .  Ive no wish to stop about here , said I .  I think I shall go to Leatherhead , for my wife was there .  He shot out a pointing finger .  It is you , said he; the man from Woking .  And you werent killed at Weybridge ?  I recognised him at the same moment .  You are the artilleryman who came into my garden .  Good luck! he said .  We are lucky ones!  Fancy you!  He put out a hand , and I took it .  I crawled up a drain , he said . But they didnt kill everyone .  And after they went away I got off towards Walton across the fields .  But---- Its not sixteen days altogether--and your hair is grey .  He looked over his shoulder suddenly .  Only a rook , he said .  One gets to know that birds have shadows these days .  This is a bit open .  Let us crawl under those bushes and talk .  Have you seen any Martians ? I said .  Since I crawled out----  Theyve gone away across London , he said .  I guess theyve got a bigger camp there .  Of a night , all over there , Hampstead way , the sky is alive with their lights .  Its like a great city , and in the glare you can just see them moving .  By daylight you cant .  But nearer--I havent seen them-- (he counted on his fingers) five days .  Then I saw a couple across Hammersmith way carrying something big .  And the night before last--he stopped and spoke impressively--it was just a matter of lights , but it was something up in the air .  I believe theyve built a flying-machine , and are learning to fly .  I stopped , on hands and knees , for we had come to the bushes .  Fly!  Yes , he said , fly .  I went on into a little bower , and sat down .  It is all over with humanity , I said .  If they can do that they will simply go round the world .  He nodded .  They will .  But---- It will relieve things over here a bit .  And besides----  He looked at me .  Arent you satisfied it is up with humanity ?  I am .  Were down; were beat .  I stared .  Strange as it may seem , I had not arrived at this fact--a fact perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke .  I had still held a vague hope; rather , I had kept a lifelong habit of mind .  He repeated his words , Were beat .  They carried absolute conviction .  Its all over , he said .  Theyve lost one--just one .  And theyve made their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world . Theyve walked over us .  The death of that one at Weybridge was an accident .  And these are only pioneers .  They kept on coming .  These green stars--Ive seen none these five or six days , but Ive no doubt theyre falling somewhere every night .  Nothings to be done .  Were under! Were beat!  I made him no answer .  I sat staring before me , trying in vain to devise some countervailing thought .  This isnt a war , said the artilleryman .  It never was a war , any more than theres war between man and ants .  Suddenly I recalled the night in the observatory .  After the tenth shot they fired no more--at least , until the first cylinder came .  How do you know ? said the artilleryman .  I explained .  He thought . Something wrong with the gun , he said .  But what if there is ? Theyll get it right again .  And even if theres a delay , how can it alter the end ?  Its just men and ants .  Theres the ants builds their cities , live their lives , have wars , revolutions , until the men want them out of the way , and then they go out of the way .  Thats what we are now--just ants .  Only----  Yes , I said .  Were eatable ants .  We sat looking at each other .  And what will they do with us ? I said .  Thats what Ive been thinking , he said; thats what Ive been thinking .  After Weybridge I went south--thinking .  I saw what was up . Most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves . But Im not so fond of squealing .  Ive been in sight of death once or twice; Im not an ornamental soldier , and at the best and worst , death--its just death .  And its the man that keeps on thinking comes through .  I saw everyone tracking away south .  Says I , Food wont last this way , and I turned right back .  I went for the Martians like a sparrow goes for man .  All round--he waved a hand to the horizon--theyre starving in heaps , bolting , treading on each other .  .  .  .  He saw my face , and halted awkwardly .  No doubt lots who had money have gone away to France , he said .  He seemed to hesitate whether to apologise , met my eyes , and went on: Theres food all about here .  Canned things in shops; wines , spirits , mineral waters; and the water mains and drains are empty .  Well , I was telling you what I was thinking .  Heres intelligent things , I said , and it seems they want us for food .  First , theyll smash us up--ships , machines , guns , cities , all the order and organisation .  All that will go .  If we were the size of ants we might pull through .  But were not .  Its all too bulky to stop .  Thats the first certainty . Eh ?  I assented .  It is; Ive thought it out .  Very well , then--next; at present were caught as were wanted .  A Martian has only to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run .  And I saw one , one day , out by Wandsworth , picking houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage .  But they wont keep on doing that .  So soon as theyve settled all our guns and ships , and smashed our railways , and done all the things they are doing over there , they will begin catching us systematic , picking the best and storing us in cages and things .  Thats what they will start doing in a bit .  Lord!  They havent begun on us yet .  Dont you see that ?  Not begun! I exclaimed .  Not begun .  All thats happened so far is through our not having the sense to keep quiet--worrying them with guns and such foolery .  And losing our heads , and rushing off in crowds to where there wasnt any more safety than where we were .  They dont want to bother us yet . Theyre making their things--making all the things they couldnt bring with them , getting things ready for the rest of their people .  Very likely thats why the cylinders have stopped for a bit , for fear of hitting those who are here .  And instead of our rushing about blind , on the howl , or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up , weve got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs . Thats how I figure it out .  It isnt quite according to what a man wants for his species , but its about what the facts point to .  And thats the principle I acted upon .  Cities , nations , civilisation , progress--its all over .  That games up .  Were beat .  But if that is so , what is there to live for ?  The artilleryman looked at me for a moment .  There wont be any more blessed concerts for a million years or so; there wont be any Royal Academy of Arts , and no nice little feeds at restaurants .  If its amusement youre after , I reckon the game is up .  If youve got any drawing-room manners or a dislike to eating peas with a knife or dropping aitches , youd better chuck em away . They aint no further use .  You mean----  I mean that men like me are going on living--for the sake of the breed .  I tell you , Im grim set on living .  And if Im not mistaken , youll show what insides youve got , too , before long .  We arent going to be exterminated .  And I dont mean to be caught either , and tamed and fattened and bred like a thundering ox .  Ugh! Fancy those brown creepers!  You dont mean to say----  I do .  Im going on , under their feet .  Ive got it planned; Ive thought it out .  We men are beat .  We dont know enough .  Weve got to learn before weve got a chance .  And weve got to live and keep independent while we learn .  See! Thats what has to be done .  I stared , astonished , and stirred profoundly by the mans resolution .  Great God! cried I .  But you are a man indeed!  And suddenly I gripped his hand .  Eh! he said , with his eyes shining .  Ive thought it out , eh ?  Go on , I said .  Well , those who mean to escape their catching must get ready .  Im getting ready .  Mind you , it isnt all of us that are made for wild beasts; and thats what its got to be .  Thats why I watched you .  I had my doubts .  Youre slender .  I didnt know that it was you , you see , or just how youd been buried .  All these--the sort of people that lived in these houses , and all those damn little clerks that used to live down that way--theyd be no good .  They havent any spirit in them--no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasnt one or the other--Lord!  What is he but funk and precautions ?  They just used to skedaddle off to work--Ive seen hundreds of em , bit of breakfast in hand , running wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket train , for fear theyd get dismissed if they didnt; working at businesses they were afraid to take the trouble to understand; skedaddling back for fear they wouldnt be in time for dinner; keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the back streets , and sleeping with the wives they married , not because they wanted them , but because they had a bit of money that would make for safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world .  Lives insured and a bit invested for fear of accidents .  And on Sundays--fear of the hereafter .  As if hell was built for rabbits!  Well , the Martians will just be a godsend to these .  Nice roomy cages , fattening food , careful breeding , no worry .  After a week or so chasing about the fields and lands on empty stomachs , theyll come and be caught cheerful .  Theyll be quite glad after a bit .  Theyll wonder what people did before there were Martians to take care of them .  And the bar loafers , and mashers , and singers--I can imagine them .  I can imagine them , he said , with a sort of sombre gratification .  Therell be any amount of sentiment and religion loose among them .  Theres hundreds of things I saw with my eyes that Ive only begun to see clearly these last few days .  Theres lots will take things as they are--fat and stupid; and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that its all wrong , and that they ought to be doing something .  Now whenever things are so that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something , the weak , and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking , always make for a sort of do-nothing religion , very pious and superior , and submit to persecution and the will of the Lord .  Very likely youve seen the same thing .  Its energy in a gale of funk , and turned clean inside out .  These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety . And those of a less simple sort will work in a bit of--what is it ?--eroticism .  He paused .  Very likely these Martians will make pets of some of them; train them to do tricks--who knows ?--get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed .  And some , maybe , they will train to hunt us .  No , I cried , thats impossible!  No human being----  Whats the good of going on with such lies ? said the artilleryman .  Theres men whod do it cheerful .  What nonsense to pretend there isnt!  And I succumbed to his conviction .  If they come after me , he said; Lord , if they come after me! and subsided into a grim meditation .  I sat contemplating these things .  I could find nothing to bring against this mans reasoning .  In the days before the invasion no one would have questioned my intellectual superiority to his--I , a professed and recognised writer on philosophical themes , and he , a common soldier; and yet he had already formulated a situation that I had scarcely realised .  What are you doing ? I said presently .  What plans have you made ?  He hesitated .  Well , its like this , he said .  What have we to do ?  We have to invent a sort of life where men can live and breed , and be sufficiently secure to bring the children up .  Yes--wait a bit , and Ill make it clearer what I think ought to be done .  The tame ones will go like all tame beasts; in a few generations theyll be big , beautiful , rich-blooded , stupid--rubbish! The risk is that we who keep wild will go savage--degenerate into a sort of big , savage rat .  .  .  . You see , how I mean to live is underground .  Ive been thinking about the drains .  Of course those who dont know drains think horrible things; but under this London are miles and miles--hundreds of miles--and a few days rain and London empty will leave them sweet and clean . The main drains are big enough and airy enough for anyone . Then theres cellars , vaults , stores , from which bolting passages may be made to the drains . And the railway tunnels and subways .  Eh ?  You begin to see ?  And we form a band--able-bodied , clean-minded men . Were not going to pick up any rubbish that drifts in .  Weaklings go out again .  As you meant me to go ?  Well--I parleyed , didnt I ?  We wont quarrel about that .  Go on .  Those who stop obey orders .  Able-bodied , clean-minded women we want also--mothers and teachers .  No lackadaisical ladies--no blasted rolling eyes .  We cant have any weak or silly .  Life is real again , and the useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die .  They ought to die .  They ought to be willing to die .  Its a sort of disloyalty , after all , to live and taint the race .  And they cant be happy .  Moreover , dyings none so dreadful; its the funking makes it bad .  And in all those places we shall gather .  Our district will be London .  And we may even be able to keep a watch , and run about in the open when the Martians keep away .  Play cricket , perhaps .  Thats how we shall save the race .  Eh ?  Its a possible thing ?  But saving the race is nothing in itself .  As I say , thats only being rats .  Its saving our knowledge and adding to it is the thing .  There men like you come in .  Theres books , theres models .  We must make great safe places down deep , and get all the books we can; not novels and poetry swipes , but ideas , science books .  Thats where men like you come in . We must go to the British Museum and pick all those books through . Especially we must keep up our science--learn more .  We must watch these Martians .  Some of us must go as spies .  When its all working , perhaps I will .  Get caught , I mean .  And the great thing is , we must leave the Martians alone .  We mustnt even steal .  If we get in their way , we clear out .  We must show them we mean no harm .  Yes , I know . But theyre intelligent things , and they wont hunt us down if they have all they want , and think were just harmless vermin .  The artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm .  After all , it may not be so much we may have to learn before--Just imagine this: four or five of their fighting machines suddenly starting off--Heat-Rays right and left , and not a Martian in em .  Not a Martian in em , but men--men who have learned the way how .  It may be in my time , even--those men .  Fancy having one of them lovely things , with its Heat-Ray wide and free!  Fancy having it in control! What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run , after a bust like that ?  I reckon the Martiansll open their beautiful eyes!  Cant you see them , man ?  Cant you see them hurrying , hurrying--puffing and blowing and hooting to their other mechanical affairs ?  Something out of gear in every case .  And swish , bang , rattle , swish!  Just as they are fumbling over it , swish comes the Heat-Ray , and , behold! man has come back to his own .  For a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman , and the tone of assurance and courage he assumed , completely dominated my mind .  I believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in the practicability of his astonishing scheme , and the reader who thinks me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position , reading steadily with all his thoughts about his subject , and mine , crouching fearfully in the bushes and listening , distracted by apprehension .  We talked in this manner through the early morning time , and later crept out of the bushes , and , after scanning the sky for Martians , hurried precipitately to the house on Putney Hill where he had made his lair .  It was the coal cellar of the place , and when I saw the work he had spent a week upon--it was a burrow scarcely ten yards long , which he designed to reach to the main drain on Putney Hill--I had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his powers .  Such a hole I could have dug in a day .  But I believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday at his digging .  We had a garden barrow and shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range .  We refreshed ourselves with a tin of mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry .  I found a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the world in this steady labour . As we worked , I turned his project over in my mind , and presently objections and doubts began to arise; but I worked there all the morning , so glad was I to find myself with a purpose again .  After working an hour I began to speculate on the distance one had to go before the cloaca was reached , the chances we had of missing it altogether .  My immediate trouble was why we should dig this long tunnel , when it was possible to get into the drain at once down one of the manholes , and work back to the house .  It seemed to me , too , that the house was inconveniently chosen , and required a needless length of tunnel .  And just as I was beginning to face these things , the artilleryman stopped digging , and looked at me .  Were working well , he said .  He put down his spade . Let us knock off a bit he said .  I think its time we reconnoitred from the roof of the house .  I was for going on , and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade; and then suddenly I was struck by a thought .  I stopped , and so did he at once .  Why were you walking about the common , I said , instead of being here ?  Taking the air , he said .  I was coming back .  Its safer by night .  But the work ?  Oh , one cant always work , he said , and in a flash I saw the man plain .  He hesitated , holding his spade .  We ought to reconnoitre now , he said , because if any come near they may hear the spades and drop upon us unawares .  I was no longer disposed to object .  We went together to the roof and stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door .  No Martians were to be seen , and we ventured out on the tiles , and slipped down under shelter of the parapet .  From this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of Putney , but we could see the river below , a bubbly mass of red weed , and the low parts of Lambeth flooded and red .  The red creeper swarmed up the trees about the old palace , and their branches stretched gaunt and dead , and set with shrivelled leaves , from amid its clusters .  It was strange how entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing water for their propagation .  About us neither had gained a footing; laburnums , pink mays , snowballs , and trees of arbor-vitae , rose out of laurels and hydrangeas , green and brilliant into the sunlight .  Beyond Kensington dense smoke was rising , and that and a blue haze hid the northward hills .  The artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still remained in London .  One night last week , he said , some fools got the electric light in order , and there was all Regent Street and the Circus ablaze , crowded with painted and ragged drunkards , men and women , dancing and shouting till dawn .  A man who was there told me .  And as the day came they became aware of a fighting-machine standing near by the Langham and looking down at them .  Heaven knows how long he had been there . It must have given some of them a nasty turn .  He came down the road towards them , and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened to run away .  Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe!  From that , in answer to my questions , he came round to his grandiose plans again .  He grew enthusiastic .  He talked so eloquently of the possibility of capturing a fighting-machine that I more than half believed in him again .  But now that I was beginning to understand something of his quality , I could divine the stress he laid on doing nothing precipitately .  And I noted that now there was no question that he personally was to capture and fight the great machine .  After a time we went down to the cellar .  Neither of us seemed disposed to resume digging , and when he suggested a meal , I was nothing loath .  He became suddenly very generous , and when we had eaten he went away and returned with some excellent cigars .  We lit these , and his optimism glowed .  He was inclined to regard my coming as a great occasion .  Theres some champagne in the cellar , he said .  We can dig better on this Thames-side burgundy , said I .  No , said he; I am host today .  Champagne!  Great God! Weve a heavy enough task before us!  Let us take a rest and gather strength while we may .  Look at these blistered hands!  And pursuant to this idea of a holiday , he insisted upon playing cards after we had eaten .  He taught me euchre , and after dividing London between us , I taking the northern side and he the southern , we played for parish points .  Grotesque and foolish as this will seem to the sober reader , it is absolutely true , and what is more remarkable , I found the card game and several others we played extremely interesting .  Strange mind of man! that , with our species upon the edge of extermination or appalling degradation , with no clear prospect before us but the chance of a horrible death , we could sit following the chance of this painted pasteboard , and playing the joker with vivid delight .  Afterwards he taught me poker , and I beat him at three tough chess games .  When dark came we decided to take the risk , and lit a lamp .  After an interminable string of games , we supped , and the artilleryman finished the champagne .  We went on smoking the cigars . He was no longer the energetic regenerator of his species I had encountered in the morning .  He was still optimistic , but it was a less kinetic , a more thoughtful optimism .  I remember he wound up with my health , proposed in a speech of small variety and considerable intermittence .  I took a cigar , and went upstairs to look at the lights of which he had spoken that blazed so greenly along the Highgate hills .  At first I stared unintelligently across the London valley .  The northern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensington glowed redly , and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed up and vanished in the deep blue night .  All the rest of London was black .  Then , nearer , I perceived a strange light , a pale , violet-purple fluorescent glow , quivering under the night breeze .  For a space I could not understand it , and then I knew that it must be the red weed from which this faint irradiation proceeded .  With that realisation my dormant sense of wonder , my sense of the proportion of things , awoke again .  I glanced from that to Mars , red and clear , glowing high in the west , and then gazed long and earnestly at the darkness of Hampstead and Highgate .  I remained a very long time upon the roof , wondering at the grotesque changes of the day .  I recalled my mental states from the midnight prayer to the foolish card-playing .  I had a violent revulsion of feeling .  I remember I flung away the cigar with a certain wasteful symbolism .  My folly came to me with glaring exaggeration .  I seemed a traitor to my wife and to my kind; I was filled with remorse .  I resolved to leave this strange undisciplined dreamer of great things to his drink and gluttony , and to go on into London .  There , it seemed to me , I had the best chance of learning what the Martians and my fellowmen were doing .  I was still upon the roof when the late moon rose .    CHAPTER EIGHT  DEAD LONDON   After I had parted from the artilleryman , I went down the hill , and by the High Street across the bridge to Fulham .  The red weed was tumultuous at that time , and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that presently removed it so swiftly .  At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station I found a man lying .  He was as black as a sweep with the black dust , alive , but helplessly and speechlessly drunk .  I could get nothing from him but curses and furious lunges at my head .  I think I should have stayed by him but for the brutal expression of his face .  There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards , and it grew thicker in Fulham .  The streets were horribly quiet .  I got food--sour , hard , and mouldy , but quite eatable--in a bakers shop here .  Some way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of powder , and I passed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of the burning was an absolute relief .  Going on towards Brompton , the streets were quiet again .  Here I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon dead bodies .  I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the Fulham Road .  They had been dead many days , so that I hurried quickly past them .  The black powder covered them over , and softened their outlines .  One or two had been disturbed by dogs .  Where there was no black powder , it was curiously like a Sunday in the City , with the closed shops , the houses locked up and the blinds drawn , the desertion , and the stillness .  In some places plunderers had been at work , but rarely at other than the provision and wine shops .  A jewellers window had been broken open in one place , but apparently the thief had been disturbed , and a number of gold chains and a watch lay scattered on the pavement .  I did not trouble to touch them .  Farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the hand that hung over her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress , and a smashed magnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement .  She seemed asleep , but she was dead .  The farther I penetrated into London , the profounder grew the stillness .  But it was not so much the stillness of death--it was the stillness of suspense , of expectation .  At any time the destruction that had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis , and had annihilated Ealing and Kilburn , might strike among these houses and leave them smoking ruins .  It was a city condemned and derelict .  .  .  .  In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder .  It was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling . It crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses .  It was a sobbing alternation of two notes , Ulla , ulla , ulla , ulla , keeping on perpetually .  When I passed streets that ran northward it grew in volume , and houses and buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off again .  It came in a full tide down Exhibition Road .  I stopped , staring towards Kensington Gardens , wondering at this strange , remote wailing .  It was as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude .  Ulla , ulla , ulla , ulla , wailed that superhuman note--great waves of sound sweeping down the broad , sunlit roadway , between the tall buildings on each side .  I turned northwards , marvelling , towards the iron gates of Hyde Park .  I had half a mind to break into the Natural History Museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers , in order to see across the park .  But I decided to keep to the ground , where quick hiding was possible , and so went on up the Exhibition Road .  All the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and still , and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses .  At the top , near the park gate , I came upon a strange sight--a bus overturned , and the skeleton of a horse picked clean .  I puzzled over this for a time , and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine . The voice grew stronger and stronger , though I could see nothing above the housetops on the north side of the park , save a haze of smoke to the northwest .  Ulla , ulla , ulla , ulla , cried the voice , coming , as it seemed to me , from the district about Regents Park .  The desolating cry worked upon my mind .  The mood that had sustained me passed .  The wailing took possession of me .  I found I was intensely weary , footsore , and now again hungry and thirsty .  It was already past noon .  Why was I wandering alone in this city of the dead ?  Why was I alone when all London was lying in state , and in its black shroud ?  I felt intolerably lonely .  My mind ran on old friends that I had forgotten for years .  I thought of the poisons in the chemists shops , of the liquors the wine merchants stored; I recalled the two sodden creatures of despair , who so far as I knew , shared the city with myself .  .  .  .  I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch , and here again were black powder and several bodies , and an evil , ominous smell from the gratings of the cellars of some of the houses .  I grew very thirsty after the heat of my long walk .  With infinite trouble I managed to break into a public-house and get food and drink .  I was weary after eating , and went into the parlour behind the bar , and slept on a black horsehair sofa I found there .  I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears , Ulla , ulla , ulla , ulla .  It was now dusk , and after I had routed out some biscuits and a cheese in the bar--there was a meat safe , but it contained nothing but maggots--I wandered on through the silent residential squares to Baker Street--Portman Square is the only one I can name--and so came out at last upon Regents Park .  And as I emerged from the top of Baker Street , I saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset the hood of the Martian giant from which this howling proceeded .  I was not terrified .  I came upon him as if it were a matter of course .  I watched him for some time , but he did not move .  He appeared to be standing and yelling , for no reason that I could discover .  I tried to formulate a plan of action .  That perpetual sound of Ulla , ulla , ulla , ulla , confused my mind .  Perhaps I was too tired to be very fearful .  Certainly I was more curious to know the reason of this monotonous crying than afraid .  I turned back away from the park and struck into Park Road , intending to skirt the park , went along under the shelter of the terraces , and got a view of this stationary , howling Martian from the direction of St . Johns Wood .  A couple of hundred yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus , and saw , first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong towards me , and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him .  He made a wide curve to avoid me , as though he feared I might prove a fresh competitor .  As the yelping died away down the silent road , the wailing sound of Ulla , ulla , ulla , ulla , reasserted itself .  I came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St . Johns Wood station .  At first I thought a house had fallen across the road .  It was only as I clambered among the ruins that I saw , with a start , this mechanical Samson lying , with its tentacles bent and smashed and twisted , among the ruins it had made .  The forepart was shattered .  It seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house , and had been overwhelmed in its overthrow .  It seemed to me then that this might have happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its Martian .  I could not clamber among the ruins to see it , and the twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat was smeared , and the gnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs had left , were invisible to me .  Wondering still more at all that I had seen , I pushed on towards Primrose Hill .  Far away , through a gap in the trees , I saw a second Martian , as motionless as the first , standing in the park towards the Zoological Gardens , and silent .  A little beyond the ruins about the smashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again , and found the Regents Canal , a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation .  As I crossed the bridge , the sound of Ulla , ulla , ulla , ulla , ceased .  It was , as it were , cut off .  The silence came like a thunderclap .  The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees towards the park were growing black .  All about me the red weed clambered among the ruins , writhing to get above me in the dimness . Night , the mother of fear and mystery , was coming upon me .  But while that voice sounded the solitude , the desolation , had been endurable; by virtue of it London had still seemed alive , and the sense of life about me had upheld me .  Then suddenly a change , the passing of something--I knew not what--and then a stillness that could be felt . Nothing but this gaunt quiet .  London about me gazed at me spectrally .  The windows in the white houses were like the eye sockets of skulls .  About me my imagination found a thousand noiseless enemies moving .  Terror seized me , a horror of my temerity .  In front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was tarred , and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway .  I could not bring myself to go on .  I turned down St . Johns Wood Road , and ran headlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn .  I hid from the night and the silence , until long after midnight , in a cabmens shelter in Harrow Road .  But before the dawn my courage returned , and while the stars were still in the sky I turned once more towards Regents Park .  I missed my way among the streets , and presently saw down a long avenue , in the half-light of the early dawn , the curve of Primrose Hill .  On the summit , towering up to the fading stars , was a third Martian , erect and motionless like the others .  An insane resolve possessed me .  I would die and end it .  And I would save myself even the trouble of killing myself .  I marched on recklessly towards this Titan , and then , as I drew nearer and the light grew , I saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about the hood .  At that my heart gave a bound , and I began running along the road .  I hurried through the red weed that choked St . Edmunds Terrace (I waded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from the waterworks towards the Albert Road) , and emerged upon the grass before the rising of the sun .  Great mounds had been heaped about the crest of the hill , making a huge redoubt of it--it was the final and largest place the Martians had made--and from behind these heaps there rose a thin smoke against the sky .  Against the sky line an eager dog ran and disappeared .  The thought that had flashed into my mind grew real , grew credible .  I felt no fear , only a wild , trembling exultation , as I ran up the hill towards the motionless monster .  Out of the hood hung lank shreds of brown , at which the hungry birds pecked and tore .  In another moment I had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood upon its crest , and the interior of the redoubt was below me .  A mighty space it was , with gigantic machines here and there within it , huge mounds of material and strange shelter places .  And scattered about it , some in their overturned war-machines , some in the now rigid handling-machines , and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row , were the Martians--dead!--slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red weed was being slain; slain , after all mans devices had failed , by the humblest things that God , in his wisdom , has put upon this earth .  For so it had come about , as indeed I and many men might have foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds .  These germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things--taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here . But by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle , and to many--those that cause putrefaction in dead matter , for instance--our living frames are altogether immune .  But there are no bacteria in Mars , and directly these invaders arrived , directly they drank and fed , our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow .  Already when I watched them they were irrevocably doomed , dying and rotting even as they went to and fro .  It was inevitable .  By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth , and it is his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten times as mighty as they are .  For neither do men live nor die in vain .  Here and there they were scattered , nearly fifty altogether , in that great gulf they had made , overtaken by a death that must have seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be .  To me also at that time this death was incomprehensible .  All I knew was that these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead . For a moment I believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated , that God had repented , that the Angel of Death had slain them in the night .  I stood staring into the pit , and my heart lightened gloriously , even as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his rays .  The pit was still in darkness; the mighty engines , so great and wonderful in their power and complexity , so unearthly in their tortuous forms , rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows towards the light .  A multitude of dogs , I could hear , fought over the bodies that lay darkly in the depth of the pit , far below me .  Across the pit on its farther lip , flat and vast and strange , lay the great flying-machine with which they had been experimenting upon our denser atmosphere when decay and death arrested them .  Death had come not a day too soon .  At the sound of a cawing overhead I looked up at the huge fighting-machine that would fight no more for ever , at the tattered red shreds of flesh that dripped down upon the overturned seats on the summit of Primrose Hill .  I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where , enhaloed now in birds , stood those other two Martians that I had seen overnight , just as death had overtaken them .  The one had died , even as it had been crying to its companions; perhaps it was the last to die , and its voice had gone on perpetually until the force of its machinery was exhausted .  They glittered now , harmless tripod towers of shining metal , in the brightness of the rising sun .  All about the pit , and saved as by a miracle from everlasting destruction , stretched the great Mother of Cities .  Those who have only seen London veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine the naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses .  Eastward , over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace and the splintered spire of the church , the sun blazed dazzling in a clear sky , and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs caught the light and glared with a white intensity .  Northward were Kilburn and Hampsted , blue and crowded with houses; westward the great city was dimmed; and southward , beyond the Martians , the green waves of Regents Park , the Langham Hotel , the dome of the Albert Hall , the Imperial Institute , and the giant mansions of the Brompton Road came out clear and little in the sunrise , the jagged ruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond .  Far away and blue were the Surrey hills , and the towers of the Crystal Palace glittered like two silver rods .  The dome of St . Pauls was dark against the sunrise , and injured , I saw for the first time , by a huge gaping cavity on its western side .  And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and churches , silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous hopes and efforts , the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this human reef , and of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung over it all; when I realised that the shadow had been rolled back , and that men might still live in the streets , and this dear vast dead city of mine be once more alive and powerful , I felt a wave of emotion that was near akin to tears .  The torment was over .  Even that day the healing would begin .  The survivors of the people scattered over the country--leaderless , lawless , foodless , like sheep without a shepherd--the thousands who had fled by sea , would begin to return; the pulse of life , growing stronger and stronger , would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the vacant squares .  Whatever destruction was done , the hand of the destroyer was stayed .  All the gaunt wrecks , the blackened skeletons of houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the hill , would presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and ringing with the tapping of their trowels .  At the thought I extended my hands towards the sky and began thanking God .  In a year , thought I--in a year .  .  .  With overwhelming force came the thought of myself , of my wife , and the old life of hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever .    CHAPTER NINE  WRECKAGE   And now comes the strangest thing in my story .  Yet , perhaps , it is not altogether strange .  I remember , clearly and coldly and vividly , all that I did that day until the time that I stood weeping and praising God upon the summit of Primrose Hill .  And then I forget .  Of the next three days I know nothing .  I have learned since that , so far from my being the first discoverer of the Martian overthrow , several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the previous night .  One man--the first--had gone to St . Martins-le-Grand , and , while I sheltered in the cabmens hut , had contrived to telegraph to Paris .  Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world; a thousand cities , chilled by ghastly apprehensions , suddenly flashed into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin , Edinburgh , Manchester , Birmingham , at the time when I stood upon the verge of the pit .  Already men , weeping with joy , as I have heard , shouting and staying their work to shake hands and shout , were making up trains , even as near as Crewe , to descend upon London .  The church bells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news , until all England was bell-ringing .  Men on cycles , lean-faced , unkempt , scorched along every country lane shouting of unhoped deliverance , shouting to gaunt , staring figures of despair .  And for the food!  Across the Channel , across the Irish Sea , across the Atlantic , corn , bread , and meat were tearing to our relief .  All the shipping in the world seemed going Londonward in those days .  But of all this I have no memory .  I drifted--a demented man .  I found myself in a house of kindly people , who had found me on the third day wandering , weeping , and raving through the streets of St . Johns Wood . They have told me since that I was singing some insane doggerel about The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah!  The Last Man Left Alive!  Troubled as they were with their own affairs , these people , whose name , much as I would like to express my gratitude to them , I may not even give here , nevertheless cumbered themselves with me , sheltered me , and protected me from myself .  Apparently they had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse .  Very gently , when my mind was assured again , did they break to me what they had learned of the fate of Leatherhead .  Two days after I was imprisoned it had been destroyed , with every soul in it , by a Martian .  He had swept it out of existence , as it seemed , without any provocation , as a boy might crush an ant hill , in the mere wantonness of power .  I was a lonely man , and they were very kind to me .  I was a lonely man and a sad one , and they bore with me .  I remained with them four days after my recovery .  All that time I felt a vague , a growing craving to look once more on whatever remained of the little life that seemed so happy and bright in my past .  It was a mere hopeless desire to feast upon my misery .  They dissuaded me .  They did all they could to divert me from this morbidity .  But at last I could resist the impulse no longer , and , promising faithfully to return to them , and parting , as I will confess , from these four-day friends with tears , I went out again into the streets that had lately been so dark and strange and empty .  Already they were busy with returning people; in places even there were shops open , and I saw a drinking fountain running water .  I remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I went back on my melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at Woking , how busy the streets and vivid the moving life about me .  So many people were abroad everywhere , busied in a thousand activities , that it seemed incredible that any great proportion of the population could have been slain .  But then I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I met , how shaggy the hair of the men , how large and bright their eyes , and that every other man still wore his dirty rags .  Their faces seemed all with one of two expressions--a leaping exultation and energy or a grim resolution .  Save for the expression of the faces , London seemed a city of tramps .  The vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sent us by the French government .  The ribs of the few horses showed dismally .  Haggard special constables with white badges stood at the corners of every street .  I saw little of the mischief wrought by the Martians until I reached Wellington Street , and there I saw the red weed clambering over the buttresses of Waterloo Bridge .  At the corner of the bridge , too , I saw one of the common contrasts of that grotesque time--a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of the red weed , transfixed by a stick that kept it in place .  It was the placard of the first newspaper to resume publication--the Daily Mail .  I bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket . Most of it was in blank , but the solitary compositor who did the thing had amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement stereo on the back page .  The matter he printed was emotional; the news organisation had not as yet found its way back .  I learned nothing fresh except that already in one week the examination of the Martian mechanisms had yielded astonishing results .  Among other things , the article assured me what I did not believe at the time , that the Secret of Flying , was discovered .  At Waterloo I found the free trains that were taking people to their homes .  The first rush was already over .  There were few people in the train , and I was in no mood for casual conversation .  I got a compartment to myself , and sat with folded arms , looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows .  And just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails , and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins .  To Clapham Junction the face of London was grimy with powder of the Black Smoke , in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain , and at Clapham Junction the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds of out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary navvies , and we were jolted over a hasty relaying .  All down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered .  Walton , by virtue of its unburned pine woods , seemed the least hurt of any place along the line .  The Wandle , the Mole , every little stream , was a heaped mass of red weed , in appearance between butchers meat and pickled cabbage .  The Surrey pine woods were too dry , however , for the festoons of the red climber .  Beyond Wimbledon , within sight of the line , in certain nursery grounds , were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder .  A number of people were standing about it , and some sappers were busy in the midst of it .  Over it flaunted a Union Jack , flapping cheerfully in the morning breeze .  The nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with the weed , a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows , and very painful to the eye .  Ones gaze went with infinite relief from the scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green softness of the eastward hills .  The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing repair , so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to Maybury , past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars , and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in the thunderstorm .  Here , moved by curiosity , I turned aside to find , among a tangle of red fronds , the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed .  For a time I stood regarding these vestiges .  .  .  .  Then I returned through the pine wood , neck-high with red weed here and there , to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found burial , and so came home past the College Arms .  A man standing at an open cottage door greeted me by name as I passed .  I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately .  The door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as I approached .  It slammed again .  The curtains of my study fluttered out of the open window from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn .  No one had closed it since .  The smashed bushes were just as I had left them nearly four weeks ago .  I stumbled into the hall , and the house felt empty .  The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had crouched , soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the catastrophe .  Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up the stairs .  I followed them to my study , and found lying on my writing-table still , with the selenite paper weight upon it , the sheet of work I had left on the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder .  For a space I stood reading over my abandoned arguments .  It was a paper on the probable development of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilising process; and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy: In about two hundred years , I had written , we may expect----  The sentence ended abruptly .  I remembered my inability to fix my mind that morning , scarcely a month gone by , and how I had broken off to get my Daily Chronicle from the newsboy .  I remembered how I went down to the garden gate as he came along , and how I had listened to his odd story of Men from Mars .  I came down and went into the dining room .  There were the mutton and the bread , both far gone now in decay , and a beer bottle overturned , just as I and the artilleryman had left them .  My home was desolate .  I perceived the folly of the faint hope I had cherished so long .  And then a strange thing occurred .  It is no use , said a voice .  The house is deserted .  No one has been here these ten days . Do not stay here to torment yourself .  No one escaped but you .  I was startled .  Had I spoken my thought aloud ?  I turned , and the French window was open behind me .  I made a step to it , and stood looking out .  And there , amazed and afraid , even as I stood amazed and afraid , were my cousin and my wife--my wife white and tearless .  She gave a faint cry .  I came , she said .  I knew--knew----  She put her hand to her throat--swayed .  I made a step forward , and caught her in my arms .    CHAPTER TEN  THE EPILOGUE   I cannot but regret , now that I am concluding my story , how little I am able to contribute to the discussion of the many debatable questions which are still unsettled .  In one respect I shall certainly provoke criticism .  My particular province is speculative philosophy . My knowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two , but it seems to me that Carvers suggestions as to the reason of the rapid death of the Martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as a proven conclusion .  I have assumed that in the body of my narrative .  At any rate , in all the bodies of the Martians that were examined after the war , no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species were found .  That they did not bury any of their dead , and the reckless slaughter they perpetrated , point also to an entire ignorance of the putrefactive process .  But probable as this seems , it is by no means a proven conclusion .  Neither is the composition of the Black Smoke known , which the Martians used with such deadly effect , and the generator of the Heat-Rays remains a puzzle .  The terrible disasters at the Ealing and South Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further investigations upon the latter .  Spectrum analysis of the black powder points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a brilliant group of three lines in the green , and it is possible that it combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly effect upon some constituent in the blood .  But such unproven speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader , to whom this story is addressed .  None of the brown scum that drifted down the Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined at the time , and now none is forthcoming .  The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians , so far as the prowling dogs had left such an examination possible , I have already given .  But everyone is familiar with the magnificent and almost complete specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum , and the countless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that the interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific .  A question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of another attack from the Martians .  I do not think that nearly enough attention is being given to this aspect of the matter .  At present the planet Mars is in conjunction , but with every return to opposition I , for one , anticipate a renewal of their adventure .  In any case , we should be prepared .  It seems to me that it should be possible to define the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged , to keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet , and to anticipate the arrival of the next attack .  In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery before it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge , or they might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened .  It seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure of their first surprise .  Possibly they see it in the same light .  Lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martians have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet Venus .  Seven months ago now , Venus and Mars were in alignment with the sun; that is to say , Mars was in opposition from the point of view of an observer on Venus .  Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet , and almost simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was detected upon a photograph of the Martian disk .  One needs to see the drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their remarkable resemblance in character .  At any rate , whether we expect another invasion or not , our views of the human future must be greatly modified by these events .  We have learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space .  It may be that in the larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of decadence , the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous , and it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of mankind .  It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson , and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement .  Be that as it may , for many years yet there will certainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk , and those fiery darts of the sky , the shooting stars , will bring with them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men .  The broadening of mens views that has resulted can scarcely be exaggerated .  Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty surface of our minute sphere .  Now we see further .  If the Martians can reach Venus , there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible for men , and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth uninhabitable , as at last it must do , it may be that the thread of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet within its toils .  Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of life spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space .  But that is a remote dream .  It may be , on the other hand , that the destruction of the Martians is only a reprieve .  To them , and not to us , perhaps , is the future ordained .  I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind .  I sit in my study writing by lamplight , and suddenly I see again the healing valley below set with writhing flames , and feel the house behind and about me empty and desolate .  I go out into the Byfleet Road , and vehicles pass me , a butcher boy in a cart , a cabful of visitors , a workman on a bicycle , children going to school , and suddenly they become vague and unreal , and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot , brooding silence .  Of a night I see the black powder darkening the silent streets , and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they rise upon me tattered and dog-bitten .  They gibber and grow fiercer , paler , uglier , mad distortions of humanity at last , and I wake , cold and wretched , in the darkness of the night .  I go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and the Strand , and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the past , haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched , going to and fro , phantasms in a dead city , the mockery of life in a galvanised body .  And strange , too , it is to stand on Primrose Hill , as I did but a day before writing this last chapter , to see the great province of houses , dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and mist , vanishing at last into the vague lower sky , to see the people walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill , to see the sight-seers about the Martian machine that stands there still , to hear the tumult of playing children , and to recall the time when I saw it all bright and clear-cut , hard and silent , under the dawn of that last great day .  .  .  .  And strangest of all is it to hold my wifes hand again , and to think that I have counted her , and that she has counted me , among the dead . EXPERT OPINIONS   With apologies to gent opposite , said Clowes , I must say I dont think much of the team .  Dont apologise to me , said Allardyce disgustedly , as he filled the teapot , I think theyre rotten .  They ought to have got into form by now , too , said Trevor . Its not as if this was the first game of the term .  First game! Allardyce laughed shortly . Why , weve only got a couple of club matches and the return match with Ripton to end the season . It is about time they got into form , as you say .  Clowes stared pensively into the fire .  They struck me , he said , as the sort of team whod get into form somewhere in the middle of the cricket season .  Thats about it , said Allardyce . Try those biscuits , Trevor . Theyre about the only good thing left in the place .  School isnt what it was ? inquired Trevor , plunging a hand into the tin that stood on the floor beside him .  No , said Allardyce , not only in footer but in everything . The place seems absolutely rotten . Its bad enough losing all our matches , or nearly all . Did you hear that Ripton took thirty-seven points off us last term ? And we only just managed to beat Greenburgh by a try to nil .  We got thirty points last year , he went on . Thirty-three , and forty-two the year before . Why , weve always simply walked them . Its an understood thing that we smash them . And this year they held us all the time , and it was only a fluke that we scored at all . Their back miskicked , and let Barry in .  Barry struck me as the best of the outsides today , said Clowes . Hes heavier than he was , and faster .  Hes all right , agreed Allardyce . If only the centres would feed him , we might do something occasionally . But did you ever see such a pair of rotters ?  The man who was marking me certainly didnt seem particularly brilliant . I dont even know his name . He didnt do anything at footer in my time , said Trevor .  Hes a chap called Attell . He wasnt here with you . He came after the summer holidays . I believe he was sacked from somewhere . Hes no good , but theres nobody else . Colours have been simply a gift this year to anyone who can do a thing . Only Barry and myself left from last years team . I never saw such a clearance as there was after the summer term .  Where are the boys of the Old Brigade ? sighed Clowes .  I dont know . I wish they were here , said Allardyce .  Trevor and Clowes had come down , after the Easter term had been in progress for a fortnight , to play for an Oxford A team against the school . The match had resulted in an absurdly easy victory for the visitors by over forty points . Clowes had scored five tries off his own bat , and Trevor , if he had not fed his wing so conscientiously , would probably have scored an equal number . As it was , he had got through twice , and also dropped a goal . The two were now having a late tea with Allardyce in his study . Allardyce had succeeded Trevor as Captain of Football at Wrykyn , and had found the post anything but a sinecure .  For Wrykyn had fallen for the time being on evil days . It was experiencing the reaction which so often takes place in a school in the year following a season of exceptional athletic prosperity . With Trevor as captain of football , both the Ripton matches had been won , and also three out of the four other school matches . In cricket the eleven had had an even finer record , winning all their school matches , and likewise beating the M .C .C . and Old Wrykinians . It was too early to prophesy concerning the fortunes of next terms cricket team , but , if they were going to resemble the fifteen , Wrykyn was doomed to the worst athletic year it had experienced for a decade .  Its a bit of a come-down after last season , isnt it ? resumed Allardyce , returning to his sorrows . It was a relief to him to discuss his painful case without restraint .  We were a fine team last year , agreed Clowes , and especially strong on the left wing . By the way , I see youve moved Barry across .  Yes . Attell cant pass much , but he passes better from right to left than from left to right; so , Barry being our scoring man , I shifted him across . The chap on the other wing , Stanning , isnt bad at times . Do you remember him ? Hes in Applebys . Then Drummonds useful at half .  Jolly useful , said Trevor . I thought he would be . I recommended you last year to keep your eye on him .  Decent chap , Drummond , said Clowes .  About the only one there is left in the place , observed Allardyce gloomily .  Our genial host , said Clowes , sawing at the cake , appears to have that tired feeling . He seems to have lost that joie de vivre of his , what ?  It must be pretty sickening , said Trevor sympathetically . Im glad I wasnt captain in a bad year .  The rummy thing is that the worse they are , the more side they stick on . You see chaps who wouldnt have been in the third in a good year walking about in first fifteen blazers , and first fifteen scarves , and first fifteen stockings , and sweaters with first fifteen colours round the edges . I wonder they dont tattoo their faces with first fifteen colours .  It would improve some of them , said Clowes .  Allardyce resumed his melancholy remarks . But , as I was saying , its not only that the footers rotten . That you cant help , I suppose . Its the general beastliness of things that I bar . Rows with the town , for instance . Weve been having them on and off ever since you left . And itll be worse now , because theres an election coming off soon . Are you fellows stopping for the night in the town ? If so , I should advise you to look out for yourselves .  Thanks , said Clowes . I shouldnt like to see Trevor sand-bagged . Nor indeed , should I--for choice--care to be sand-bagged myself . But , as it happens , the good Donaldson is putting us up , so we escape the perils of the town .  Everybody seems so beastly slack now , continued Allardyce . Its considered the thing . Youre looked on as an awful blood if you say you havent done a stroke of work for a week . I shouldnt mind that so much if they were some good at anything . But they cant do a thing . The footers rotten , the gymnasium six is made up of kids an inch high--we shall probably be about ninetieth at the Public Schools Competition--and there isnt any one who can play racquets for nuts . The only thing that Wrykynll do this year is to get the Light-Weights at Aldershot . Drummond ought to manage that . He won the Feathers last time . Hes nearly a stone heavier now , and awfully good . But hes the only man we shall send up , I expect . Now that OHara and Moriarty are both gone , hes the only chap we have whos up to Aldershot form . And nobody elsell take the trouble to practice . Theyre all too slack .  In fact , said Clowes , getting up , as was only to be expected , the school started going to the dogs directly I left . We shall have to be pushing on now , Allardyce . We promised to look in on Seymour before we went to bed . Friend let us away .  Good night , said Allardyce .  What you want , said Clowes solemnly , is a liver pill . You are looking on life too gloomily . Take a pill . Let there be no stint . Take two . Then we shall hear your merry laugh ringing through the old cloisters once more . Buck up and be a bright and happy lad , Allardyce .  Take more than a pill to make me that , growled that soured footballer .  Mr Seymours views on the school resembled those of Allardyce . Wrykyn , in his opinion , was suffering from a reaction .  Its always the same , he said , after a very good year . Boys leave , and its hard to fill their places . I must say I did not expect quite such a clearing out after the summer . We have had bad luck in that way . Maurice , for instance , and Robinson both ought to have had another year at school . It was quite unexpected , their leaving . They would have made all the difference to the forwards . You must have somebody to lead the pack who has had a little experience of first fifteen matches .  But even then , said Clowes , they oughtnt to be so rank as they were this afternoon . They seemed such slackers .  Im afraid thats the failing of the school just now , agreed Mr Seymour . They dont play themselves out . They dont put just that last ounce into their work which makes all the difference .  Clowes thought of saying that , to judge by appearances , they did not put in even the first ounce; but refrained . However low an opinion a games master may have--and even express--of his team , he does not like people to agree too cordially with his criticisms .  Allardyce seems rather sick about it , said Trevor .  I am sorry for Allardyce . It is always unpleasant to be the only survivor of an exceptionally good team . He cant forget last years matches , and suffers continual disappointments because the present team does not play up to the same form .  He was saying something about rows with the town , said Trevor , after a pause .  Yes , there has certainly been some unpleasantness lately . It is the penalty we pay for being on the outskirts of a town . Four years out of five nothing happens . But in the fifth , when the school has got a little out of hand--  Oh , then it really has got out of hand ? asked Clowes .  Between ourselves , yes , admitted Mr Seymour .  What sort of rows ? asked Trevor .  Mr Seymour couldnt explain exactly . Nothing , as it were , definite--as yet . No actual complaints so far . But still--well , trouble--yes , trouble .  For instance , he said , a boy in my house , Linton--you remember him ?--is moving in society at this moment with a swollen lip and minus a front tooth . Of course , I know nothing about it , but I fancy he got into trouble in the town . That is merely a straw which shows how the wind is blowing , but if you lived on the spot you would see more what I mean . There is trouble in the air . And now that this election is coming on , I should not wonder if things came to a head . I cant remember a single election in Wrykyn when there was not disorder in the town . And if the school is going to join in , as it probably will , I shall not be sorry when the holidays come . I know the headmaster is only waiting for an excuse to put the town out of bounds .  But the kids have always had a few rows on with that school in the High Street--whats its name--St Something ? said Clowes .  Judes , supplied Trevor .  St Judes! said Mr Seymour . Have they ? I didnt know that .  Oh yes . I dont know how it started , but its been going on for two or three years now . Its a School House feud really , but Dexters are mixed up in it somehow . If a School House fag goes down town he runs like an antelope along the High Street , unless hes got one or two friends with him . I saved dozens of kids from destruction when I was at school . The St Judes fellows lie in wait , and dash out on them . I used to find School House fags fighting for their lives in back alleys . The enemy fled on my approach . My air of majesty overawed them .  But a junior school feud matters very little , said Mr Seymour . You say it has been going on for three years; and I have never heard of it till now . It is when the bigger fellows get mixed up with the town that we have to interfere . I wish the headmaster would put the place out of bounds entirely until the election is over . Except at election time , the town seems to go to sleep .  Thats what we ought to be doing , said Clowes to Trevor . I think we had better be off now , sir . We promised Mr Donaldson to be in some time tonight .  Its later than I thought , said Mr Seymour . Good night , Clowes . How many tries was it that you scored this afternoon ? Five ? I wish you were still here , to score them for instead of against us . Good night , Trevor . I was glad to see they tried you for Oxford , though you didnt get your blue . Youll be in next year all right . Good night .  The two Old Wrykinians walked along the road towards Donaldsons . It was a fine night , but misty .  Jove , Im quite tired , said Clowes . Hullo!  Whats up ?  They were opposite Applebys at the moment . Clowes drew him into the shadow of the fence .  Theres a chap breaking out . I saw him shinning down a rope . Lets wait , and see who it is .  A moment later somebody ran softly through the gateway and disappeared down the road that led to the town .  Who was it ? said Trevor . I couldnt see .  I spotted him all right . It was that chap who was marking me today , Stanning . Wonder what hes after . Perhaps hes gone to tar the statue , like OHara . Rather a sportsman .  Rather a silly idiot , said Trevor . I hope he gets caught .  You always were one of those kind sympathetic chaps , said Clowes . Come on , or Donaldsonll be locking us out .     II  SHEEN AT HOME   On the afternoon following the Oxford A match , Sheen , of Seymours , was sitting over the gas-stove in his study with a Thucydides . He had been staying in that day with a cold . He was always staying in . Everyone has his hobby . That was Sheens .  Nobody at Wrykyn , even at Seymours , seemed to know Sheen very well , with the exception of Drummond; and those who troubled to think about the matter at all rather wondered what Drummond saw in him . To the superficial observer the two had nothing in common . Drummond was good at games--he was in the first fifteen and the second eleven , and had won the Feather Weights at Aldershot--and seemed to have no interests outside them . Sheen , on the other hand , played fives for the house , and that was all . He was bad at cricket , and had given up football by special arrangement with Allardyce , on the plea that he wanted all his time for work . He was in for an in-school scholarship , the Gotford . Allardyce , though professing small sympathy with such a degraded ambition , had given him a special dispensation , and since then Sheen had retired from public life even more than he had done hitherto . The examination for the Gotford was to come off towards the end of the term .  The only other Wrykinians with whom Sheen was known to be friendly were Stanning and Attell , of Applebys . And here those who troubled to think about it wondered still more , for Sheen , whatever his other demerits , was not of the type of Stanning and Attell . There are certain members of every public school , just as there are certain members of every college at the universities , who are marked men . They have never been detected in any glaring breach of the rules , and their manner towards the powers that be is , as a rule , suave , even deferential . Yet it is one of the things which everybody knows , that they are in the black books of the authorities , and that sooner or later , in the picturesque phrase of the New Yorker , they will get it in the neck . To this class Stanning and Attell belonged . It was plain to all that the former was the leading member of the firm . A glance at the latter was enough to show that , whatever ambitions he may have had in the direction of villainy , he had not the brains necessary for really satisfactory evildoing . As for Stanning , he pursued an even course of life , always rigidly obeying the eleventh commandment , thou shalt not be found out . This kept him from collisions with the authorities; while a ready tongue and an excellent knowledge of the art of boxing--he was , after Drummond , the best Light-Weight in the place--secured him at least tolerance at the hand of the school: and , as a matter of fact , though most of those who knew him disliked him , and particularly those who , like Drummond , were what Clowes had called the Old Brigade , he had , nevertheless , a tolerably large following . A first fifteen man , even in a bad year , can generally find boys anxious to be seen about with him .  That Sheen should have been amongst these surprised one or two people , notably Mr Seymour , who , being games master had come a good deal into contact with Stanning , and had not been favourably impressed . The fact was that the keynote of Sheens character was a fear of giving offence . Within limits this is not a reprehensible trait in a persons character , but Sheen overdid it , and it frequently complicated his affairs . There come times when one has to choose which of two people one shall offend . By acting in one way , we offend A . By acting in the opposite way , we annoy B . Sheen had found himself faced by this problem when he began to be friendly with Drummond . Their acquaintance , begun over a game of fives , had progressed . Sheen admired Drummond , as the type of what he would have liked to have been , if he could have managed it . And Drummond felt interested in Sheen because nobody knew much about him . He was , in a way , mysterious . Also , he played the piano really well; and Drummond at that time would have courted anybody who could play for his benefit Mumblin Mose , and didnt mind obliging with unlimited encores .  So the two struck up an alliance , and as Drummond hated Stanning only a shade less than Stanning hated him , Sheen was under the painful necessity of choosing between them . He chose Drummond . Whereby he undoubtedly did wisely .  Sheen sat with his Thucydides over the gas-stove , and tried to interest himself in the doings of the Athenian expedition at Syracuse . His brain felt heavy and flabby . He realised dimly that this was because he took too little exercise , and he made a resolution to diminish his hours of work per diem by one , and to devote that one to fives . He would mention it to Drummond when he came in . He would probably come in to tea . The board was spread in anticipation of a visit from him . Herbert , the boot-boy , had been despatched to the town earlier in the afternoon , and had returned with certain food-stuffs which were now stacked in an appetising heap on the table .  Sheen was just making something more or less like sense out of an involved passage of Nikias speech , in which that eminent general himself seemed to have only a hazy idea of what he was talking about , when the door opened .  He looked up , expecting to see Drummond , but it was Stanning . He felt instantly that warm shooting sensation from which David Copperfield suffered in moments of embarrassment . Since the advent of Drummond he had avoided Stanning , and he could not see him without feeling uncomfortable . As they were both in the sixth form , and sat within a couple of yards of one another every day , it will be realised that he was frequently uncomfortable .  Great Scott! said Stanning , swotting ?  Sheen glanced almost guiltily at his Thucydides . Still , it was something of a relief that the other had not opened the conversation with an indictment of Drummond .  You see , he said apologetically , Im in for the Gotford .  So am I . Whats the good of swotting , though ? Im not going to do a stroke .  As Stanning was the only one of his rivals of whom he had any real fear , Sheen might have replied with justice that , if that was the case , the more he swotted the better . But he said nothing . He looked at the stove , and dogs-eared the Thucydides .  What a worm you are , always staying in! said Stanning .  I caught a cold watching the match yesterday .  Youre as flabby as-- Stanning looked round for a simile , as a dough-nut . Why dont you take some exercise ?  Im going to play fives , I think . I do need some exercise .  Fives ? Why dont you play footer ?  I havent time . I want to work .  What rot . Im not doing a stroke .  Stanning seemed to derive a spiritual pride from this admission .  Tell you what , then , said Stanning , Ill play you tomorrow after school .  Sheen looked a shade more uncomfortable , but he made an effort , and declined the invitation .  I shall probably be playing Drummond , he said .  Oh , all right , said Stanning . I dont care . Play whom you like .  There was a pause .  As a matter of fact , resumed Stanning , what I came here for was to tell you about last night . I got out , and went to Mitchells . Why didnt you come ? Didnt you get my note ? I sent a kid with it .  Mitchell was a young gentleman of rich but honest parents , who had left the school at Christmas . He was in his fathers office , and lived in his fathers house on the outskirts of the town . From time to time his father went up to London on matters connected with business , leaving him alone in the house . On these occasions Mitchell the younger would write to Stanning , with whom when at school he had been on friendly terms; and Stanning , breaking out of his house after everybody had gone to bed , would make his way to the Mitchell residence , and spend a pleasant hour or so there . Mitchell senior owned Turkish cigarettes and a billiard table . Stanning appreciated both . There was also a piano , and Stanning had brought Sheen with him one night to play it . The getting-out and the subsequent getting-in had nearly whitened Sheens hair , and it was only by a series of miracles that he had escaped detection . Once , he felt , was more than enough; and when a fag from Applebys had brought him Stannings note , containing an invitation to a second jaunt of the kind , he had refused to be lured into the business again .  Yes , I got the note , he said .  Then why didnt you come ? Mitchell was asking where you were .  Its so beastly risky .  Risky! Rot .  We should get sacked if we were caught .  Well , dont get caught , then .  Sheen registered an internal vow that he would not .  He wanted us to go again on Monday . Will you come ?  I--dont think I will , Stanning , said Sheen . It isnt worth it .  You mean you funk it . Thats whats the matter with you .  Yes , I do , admitted Sheen .  As a rule--in stories--the person who owns that he is afraid gets unlimited applause and adulation , and feels a glow of conscious merit . But with Sheen it was otherwise . The admission made him if possible , more uncomfortable than he had been before .  Mitchell will be sick , said Stanning .  Sheen said nothing .  Stanning changed the subject .  Well , at anyrate , he said , give us some tea . You seem to have been victualling for a siege .  Im awfully sorry , said Sheen , turning a deeper shade of red and experiencing a redoubled attack of the warm shooting , but the fact is , Im waiting for Drummond .  Stanning got up , and expressed his candid opinion of Drummond in a few words .  He said more . He described Sheen , too in unflattering terms .  Look here , he said , you may think it jolly fine to drop me just because youve got to know Drummond a bit , but youll be sick enough that youve done it before youve finished .  It isnt that-- began Sheen .  I dont care what it is . You slink about trying to avoid me all day , and you wont do a thing I ask you to do .  But you see--  Oh , shut up , said Stanning .     III  SHEEN RECEIVES VISITORS AND ADVICE   While Sheen had been interviewing Stanning , in study twelve , farther down the passage , Linton and his friend Dunstable , who was in Days house , were discussing ways and means . Like Stanning , Dunstable had demanded tea , and had been informed that there was none for him .  Well , you are a bright specimen , arent you ? said Dunstable , seating himself on the table which should have been groaning under the weight of cake and biscuits . I should like to know where you expect to go to . You lure me in here , and then have the cheek to tell me you havent got anything to eat . What have you done with it all ?  There was half a cake--  Bring it on .  Young Menzies bagged it after the match yesterday . His brother came down with the Oxford A team , and he had to give him tea in his study . Then there were some biscuits--  Whats the matter with biscuits ? Theyre all right . Bring them on . Biscuits forward . Show biscuits .  Menzies took them as well .  Dunstable eyed him sorrowfully .  You always were a bit of a maniac , he said , but I never thought you were quite such a complete gibberer as to let Menzies get away with all your grub . Well , the only thing to do is to touch him for tea . He owes us one . Come on .  They proceeded down the passage and stopped at the door of study three .  Hullo! said Menzies , as they entered .  Weve come to tea , said Dunstable . Cut the satisfying sandwich . Lets see a little more of that hissing urn of yours , Menzies . Bustle about , and be the dashing host .  I wasnt expecting you .  I cant help your troubles , said Dunstable .  Ive not got anything . I was thinking of coming to you , Linton .  Wheres that cake ?  Finished . My brother simply walked into it .  Greed , said Dunstable unkindly , seems to be the besetting sin of the Menzies . Well , what are you going to do about it ? I dont wish to threaten , but Im a demon when Im roused . Being done out of my tea is sure to rouse me . And owing to unfortunate accident of being stonily broken , I cant go to the shop . Youre responsible for the slump in provisions , Menzies , and you must see us through this . What are you going to do about it ?  Do either of you chaps know Sheen at all ?  I dont , said Linton . Not to speak to .  You cant expect us to know all your shady friends , said Dunstable . Why ?  Hes got a tea on this evening . If you knew him well enough , you might borrow something from him . I met Herbert in the dinner-hour carrying in all sorts of things to his study . Still , if you dont know him--  Dont let a trifle of that sort stand in the way , said Dunstable . Which is his study ?  Come on , Linton , said Dunstable . Be a man , and lead the way . Go in as if hed invited us . Ten to one hell think he did , if you dont spoil the thing by laughing .  What , invite ourselves to tea ? asked Linton , beginning to grasp the idea .  Thats it . Sheens the sort of ass who wont do a thing . Anyhow , its worth trying . Smith in our house got a tea out of him that way last term . Coming , Menzies ?  Not much . I hope he kicks you out .  Come on , then , Linton . If Menzies cares to chuck away a square meal , let him .  Thus , no sooner had the door of Sheens study closed upon Stanning than it was opened again to admit Linton and Dunstable .  Well , said Linton , affably , here we are .  Hope were not late , said Dunstable . You said somewhere about five . Its just struck . Shall we start ?  He stooped , and took the kettle from the stove .  Dont you bother , he said to Sheen , who had watched this manoeuvre with an air of amazement , Ill do all the dirty work .  But-- began Sheen .  Thats all right , said Dunstable soothingly . I like it .  The intellectual pressure of the affair was too much for Sheen . He could not recollect having invited Linton , with whom he had exchanged only about a dozen words that term , much less Dunstable , whom he merely knew by sight . Yet here they were , behaving like honoured guests . It was plain that there was a misunderstanding somewhere , but he shrank from grappling with it . He did not want to hurt their feelings . It would be awkward enough if they discovered their mistake for themselves .  So he exerted himself nervously to play the host , and the first twinge of remorse which Linton felt came when Sheen pressed upon him a bag of biscuits which , he knew , could not have cost less than one and sixpence a pound . His heart warmed to one who could do the thing in such style .  Dunstable , apparently , was worried by no scruples . He leaned back easily in his chair , and kept up a bright flow of conversation .  Youre not looking well , Sheen , he said . You ought to take more exercise . Why dont you come down town with us one of these days and do a bit of canvassing ? Its a rag . Linton lost a tooth at it the other day . Were going down on Saturday to do a bit more .  Oh! said Sheen , politely .  We shall get one or two more chaps to help next time . It isnt good enough , only us two . We had four great beefy hooligans on to us when Linton got his tooth knocked out . We had to run . Theres a regular gang of them going about the town , now that the elections on . A red-headed fellow , who looks like a butcher , seems to boss the show . They call him Albert . Hell have to be slain one of these days , for the credit of the school . I should like to get Drummond on to him .  I was expecting Drummond to tea , said Sheen .  Hes running and passing with the fifteen , said Linton . He ought to be in soon . Why , here he is . Hullo , Drummond!  Hullo! said the newcomer , looking at his two fellow-visitors as if he were surprised to see them there .  How were the First ? asked Dunstable .  Oh , rotten . Any tea left ?  Conversation flagged from this point , and shortly afterwards Dunstable and Linton went .  Come and tea with me some time , said Linton .  Oh , thanks , said Sheen . Thanks awfully .  It was rather a shame , said Linton to Dunstable , as they went back to their study , rushing him like that . I shouldnt wonder if hes quite a good sort , when one gets to know him .  He must be a rotter to let himself be rushed . By Jove , I should like to see someone try that game on with me .  In the study they had left , Drummond was engaged in pointing this out to Sheen .  The First are rank bad , he said . The outsides were passing rottenly today . We shall have another forty points taken off us when we play Ripton . By the way , I didnt know you were a pal of Lintons .  Im not , said Sheen .  Well , he seemed pretty much at home just now .  I cant understand it . Im certain I never asked him to tea . Or Dunstable either . Yet they came in as if I had . I didnt like to hurt their feelings by telling them .  Drummond stared .  What , they came without being asked! Heavens! man , you must buck up a bit and keep awake , or youll have an awful time . Of course those two chaps were simply trying it on . I had an idea it might be that when I came in . Why did you let them ? Why didnt you scrag them ?  Oh , I dont know , said Sheen uncomfortably .  But , look here , its rot . You must keep your end up in a place like this , or everybody in the housell be ragging you . Chaps will , naturally , play the goat if you let them . Has this ever happened before ?  Sheen admitted reluctantly that it had . He was beginning to see things . It is never pleasant to feel one has been bluffed .  Once last term , he said , Smith , a chap in Days , came to tea like that . I couldnt very well do anything .  And Dunstable is in Days . They compared notes . I wonder you havent had the whole school dropping in on you , lining up in long queues down the passage . Look here , Sheen , you really must pull yourself together . Im not ragging . Youll have a beastly time if youre so feeble . I hope you wont be sick with me for saying it , but I cant help that . Its all for your own good . And its really pure slackness thats the cause of it all .  I hate hurting peoples feelings , said Sheen .  Oh , rot . As if anybody here had any feelings . Besides , it doesnt hurt a chaps feelings being told to get out , when he knows hes no business in a place .  Oh , all right , said Sheen shortly .  Glad you see it , said Drummond . Well , Im off . Wonder if theres anybody in that bath .  He reappeared a few moments later . During his absence Sheen overheard certain shrill protestations which were apparently being uttered in the neighbourhood of the bathroom door .  There was , he said , putting his head into the study and grinning cheerfully at Sheen . There was young Renford , who had no earthly business to be there . Ive just looked in to point the moral . Suppose youd have let him bag all the hot water , which ought to have come to his elders and betters , for fear of hurting his feelings; and gone without your bath . I went on my theory that nobody at Wrykyn , least of all a fag , has any feelings . I turfed him out without a touch of remorse . You get much the best results my way . So long .  And the head disappeared; and shortly afterwards there came from across the passage muffled but cheerful sounds of splashing .     IV  THE BETTER PART OF VALOUR   The borough of Wrykyn had been a little unfortunate--or fortunate , according to the point of view--in the matter of elections . The latter point of view was that of the younger and more irresponsible section of the community , which liked elections because they were exciting . The former was that of the tradespeople , who disliked them because they got their windows broken .  Wrykyn had passed through an election and its attendant festivities in the previous year , when Sir Eustace Briggs , the mayor of the town , had been returned by a comfortable majority . Since then ill-health had caused that gentleman to resign his seat , and the place was once more in a state of unrest . This time the school was deeply interested in the matter . The previous election had not stirred them . They did not care whether Sir Eustace Briggs defeated Mr Saul Pedder , or whether Mr Saul Pedder wiped the political floor with Sir Eustace Briggs . Mr Pedder was an energetic Radical; but owing to the fact that Wrykyn had always returned a Conservative member , and did not see its way to a change as yet , his energy had done him very little good . The school had looked on him as a sportsman , and read his speeches in the local paper with amusement; but they were not interested . Now , however , things were changed . The Conservative candidate , Sir William Bruce , was one of themselves--an Old Wrykinian , a governor of the school , a man who always watched school-matches , and the donor of the Bruce Challenge Cup for the school mile . In fine , one of the best . He was also the father of Jack Bruce , a day-boy on the engineering side . The school would have liked to have made a popular hero of Jack Bruce . If he had liked , he could have gone about with quite a suite of retainers . But he was a quiet , self-sufficing youth , and was rarely to be seen in public . The engineering side of a public school has workshops and other weirdnesses which keep it occupied after the ordinary school hours . It was generally understood that Bruce was a good sort of chap if you knew him , but you had got to know him first; brilliant at his work , and devoted to it; a useful slow bowler; known to be able to drive and repair the family motor-car; one who seldom spoke unless spoken to , but who , when he did speak , generally had something sensible to say . Beyond that , report said little .  As he refused to allow the school to work off its enthusiasm on him , they were obliged to work it off elsewhere . Hence the disturbances which had become frequent between school and town . The inflammatory speeches of Mr Saul Pedder had caused a swashbuckling spirit to spread among the rowdy element of the town . Gangs of youths , to adopt the police-court term , had developed a habit of parading the streets arm-in-arm , shouting Good old Pedder! When these met some person or persons who did not consider Mr Pedder good and old , there was generally what the local police-force described as a frakkus .  It was in one of these frakkuses that Linton had lost a valuable tooth .  Two days had elapsed since Dunstable and Linton had looked in on Sheen for tea . It was a Saturday afternoon , and roll-call was just over . There was no first fifteen match , only a rather uninteresting house-match , Templars versus Donaldsons , and existence in the school grounds showed signs of becoming tame .  What a beastly term the Easter term is , said Linton , yawning . There wont be a thing to do till the house-matches begin properly .  Seymours had won their first match , as had Days . They would not be called upon to perform for another week or more .  Lets get a boat out , suggested Dunstable .  Such a beastly day .  Lets have tea at the shop .  Rather slow . How about going to Cooks ?  All right . Toss you who pays .  Cooks was a shop in the town to which the school most resorted when in need of refreshment .  Wonder if we shall meet Albert .  Linton licked the place where his tooth should have been , and said he hoped so .  Sergeant Cook , the six-foot proprietor of the shop , was examining a broken window when they arrived , and muttering to himself .  Hullo! said Dunstable , whats this ? New idea for ventilation ? Golly , massa , who frew dat brick ?  Done it at ar-parse six last night , he did , said Sergeant Cook , the red-eaded young scallywag . Ketch im--Ill give im--  Sounds like dear old Albert , said Linton . Who did it , sergeant ?  Red-headed young mongrel . Good old Pedder , he says . Ill give you Pedder , I says . Then bang it comes right on top of the muffins , and when I doubled out after im ed gone .  Mrs Cook appeared and corroborated witnesss evidence . Dunstable ordered tea .  We may meet him on our way home , said Linton . If we do , Ill give him something from you with your love . I owe him a lot for myself .  Mrs Cook clicked her tongue compassionately at the sight of the obvious void in the speakers mouth .  Youll ave to ave a forlse one , Mr Linton , said Sergeant Cook with gloomy relish .  The back shop was empty . Dunstable and Linton sat down and began tea . Sergeant Cook came to the door from time to time and dilated further on his grievances .  Gentlemen from the school they come in ere and says aint it all a joke and exciting and what not . But I says to them , you avent got to live in it , I says . Thats what it is . You avent got to live in it , I says . Glad when its all over , thats what Ill be .  Nother jug of hot water , please , said Linton .  The Sergeant shouted the order over his shoulder , as if he were addressing a half-company on parade , and returned to his woes .  You avent got to live in it , I says . Thats what it is . Its this everlasting worry and flurry day in and day out , and not knowing whats going to appen next , and one man coming in and saying Vote for Bruce , and another Vote for Pedder , and another saying how its the poor mans loaf hes fighting for--if hed only buy a loaf , now--ullo , ullo , wots this ?  There was a confused noise without , as Shakespeare would put it , and into the shop came clattering Barry and McTodd , of Seymours , closely followed by Stanning and Attell .  This is getting a bit too thick , said Barry , collapsing into a chair .  From the outer shop came the voice of Sergeant Cook .  Let me jest come to you , you red-eaded--  Roars of derision from the road .  Thats Albert , said Linton , jumping up .  Yes , I heard them call him that , said Barry . McTodd and I were coming down here to tea , when they started going for us , so we nipped in here , hoping to find reinforcements .  We were just behind you , said Stanning . I got one of them a beauty . He went down like a shot .  Albert ? inquired Linton .  No . A little chap .  Lets go out , and smash them up , suggested Linton excitedly .  Dunstable treated the situation more coolly .  Wait a bit , he said . No hurry . Lets finish tea at any rate . Youd better eat as much as you can now Linton . You may have no teeth left to do it with afterwards , he added cheerfully .  Lets chuck things at them , said McTodd .  Dont be an ass , said Barry . What on earths the good of that ?  Well , it would be something , said McTodd vaguely .  Hit em with a muffin , suggested Stanning . Dash , I barked my knuckles on that man . But I bet he felt it .  Look here , Im going out , said Linton . Come on , Dunstable .  Dunstable continued his meal without hurry .  Whats the excitement ? he said . Theres plenty of time . Dear old Alberts not the sort of chap to go away when hes got us cornered here . The first principle of warfare is to get a good feed before you start .  And anyhow , said Barry , I came here for tea , and Im going to have it .  Sergeant Cook was recalled from the door , and received the orders .  Theyve just gone round the corner , he said , and that red-eaded one e says hes goin to wait if he as to wait all night .  Quite right , said Dunstable , approvingly . Sensible chap , Albert . If you see him , you might tell him we shant be long , will you ?  A quarter of an hour passed .  Kerm out , shouted a voice from the street .  Dunstable looked at the others .  Perhaps we might be moving now , he said , getting up Ready ?  We must keep together , said Barry .  You goin out , Mr Dunstable ? inquired Sergeant Cook .  Yes . Good bye . Youll see that were decently buried wont you ?  The garrison made its sortie .         *       *       *       *       *  It happened that Drummond and Sheen were also among those whom it had struck that afternoon that tea at Cooks would be pleasant; and they came upon the combatants some five minutes after battle had been joined . The town contingent were filling the air with strange cries , Alberts voice being easily heard above the din , while the Wrykinians , as public-school men should , were fighting quietly and without unseemly tumult .  By Jove , said Drummond , heres a row on .  Sheen stopped dead , with a queer , sinking feeling within him . He gulped . Drummond did not notice these portents . He was observing the battle .  Suddenly he uttered an exclamation .  Why , its some of our chaps! Theres a Seymours cap . Isnt that McTodd ? And , great Scott! theres Barry . Come on , man!  Sheen did not move .  Ought we . . .to get . . .mixed up . . . ? he began .  Drummond looked at him with open eyes . Sheen babbled on .  The old man might not like--sixth form , you see--oughtnt we to-- ?  There was a yell of triumph from the town army as the red-haired Albert , plunging through the fray , sent Barry staggering against the wall . Sheen caught a glimpse of Alberts grinning face as he turned . He had a cut over one eye . It bled .  Come on , said Drummond , beginning to run to the scene of action .  Sheen paused for a moment irresolutely . Then he walked rapidly in the opposite direction .     V  THE WHITE FEATHER   It was not until he had reached his study that Sheen thoroughly realised what he had done . All the way home he had been defending himself eloquently against an imaginary accuser; and he had built up a very sound , thoughtful , and logical series of arguments to show that he was not only not to blame for what he had done , but had acted in highly statesmanlike and praiseworthy manner . After all , he was in the sixth . Not a prefect , it was true , but , still , practically a prefect . The headmaster disliked unpleasantness between school and town , much more so between the sixth form of the school and the town . Therefore , he had done his duty in refusing to be drawn into a fight with Albert and friends . Besides , why should he be expected to join in whenever he saw a couple of fellows fighting ? It wasnt reasonable . It was no business of his . Why , it was absurd . He had no quarrel with those fellows . It wasnt cowardice . It was simply that he had kept his head better than Drummond , and seen further into the matter . Besides . . . .  But when he sat down in his chair , this mood changed . There is a vast difference between the view one takes of things when one is walking briskly , and that which comes when one thinks the thing over coldly . As he sat there , the wall of defence which he had built up slipped away brick by brick , and there was the fact staring at him , without covering or disguise .  It was no good arguing against himself . No amount of argument could wipe away the truth . He had been afraid , and had shown it . And he had shown it when , in a sense , he was representing the school , when Wrykyn looked to him to help it keep its end up against the town .  The more he reflected , the more he saw how far-reaching were the consequences of that failure in the hour of need . He had disgraced himself . He had disgraced Seymours . He had disgraced the school . He was an outcast .  This mood , the natural reaction from his first glow of almost jaunty self-righteousness , lasted till the lock-up bell rang , when it was succeeded by another . This time he took a more reasonable view of the affair . It occurred to him that there was a chance that his defection had passed unnoticed . Nothing could make his case seem better in his own eyes , but it might be that the thing would end there . The house might not have lost credit .  An overwhelming curiosity seized him to find out how it had all ended . The ten minutes of grace which followed the ringing of the lock-up bell had passed . Drummond and the rest must be back by now .  He went down the passage to Drummonds study . Somebody was inside . He could hear him .  He knocked at the door .  Drummond was sitting at the table reading . He looked up , and there was a silence . Sheens mouth felt dry . He could not think how to begin . He noticed that Drummonds face was unmarked . Looking down , he saw that one of the knuckles of the hand that held the book was swollen and cut .  Drummond , I--  Drummond lowered the book .  Get out , he said . He spoke without heat , calmly , as if he were making some conventional remark by way of starting a conversation .  I only came to ask--  Get out , said Drummond again .  There was another pause . Drummond raised his book and went on reading .  Sheen left the room .  Outside he ran into Linton . Unlike Drummond , Linton bore marks of the encounter . As in the case of the hero of Calverleys poem , one of his speaking eyes was sable . The swelling of his lip was increased . There was a deep red bruise on his forehead . In spite of these injuries , however , he was cheerful . He was whistling when Sheen collided with him .  Sorry , said Linton , and went on into the study .  Well , he said , how are you feeling , Drummond ? Lucky beggar , you havent got a mark . I wish I could duck like you . Well , we have fought the good fight . Exit Albert--sweep him up . You gave him enough to last him for the rest of the term . I couldnt tackle the brute . Hes as strong as a horse . My word , it was lucky you happened to come up . Albert was making hay of us . Still , alls well that ends well . We have smitten the Philistines this day . By the way--  Whats up now ?  Who was that chap with you when you came up ?  Which chap ?  I thought I saw some one .  You shouldnt eat so much tea . You saw double .  There wasnt anybody ?  No , said Drummond .  Not Sheen ?  No , said Drummond , irritably . How many more times do you want me to say it ?  All right , said Linton , I only asked . I met him outside .  Who ?  Sheen .  Oh!  You might be sociable .  I know I might . But I want to read .  Lucky man . Wish I could . I can hardly see . Well , good bye , then . Im off .  Good , grunted Drummond . You know your way out , dont you ?  Linton went back to his own study .  Its all very well , he said to himself , for Drummond to deny it , but Ill swear I saw Sheen with him . So did Dunstable . Ill cut out and ask him about it after prep . If he really was there , and cut off , something ought to be done about it . The chap ought to be kicked . Hes a disgrace to the house .  Dunstable , questioned after preparation , refused to commit himself .  I thought I saw somebody with Drummond , he said , and I had a sort of idea it was Sheen . Still , I was pretty busy at the time , and wasnt paying much attention to anything , except that long , thin bargee with the bowler . I wish those men would hit straight . Its beastly difficult to guard a round-arm swing . My right ear feels like a cauliflower . Does it look rum ?  Beastly . But what about this ? You cant swear to Sheen then ?  No . Better give him the benefit of the doubt . What does Drummond say ? You ought to ask him .  I have . He says he was alone .  Well , that settles it . What an ass you are . If Drummond doesnt know , who does ?  I believe hes simply hushing it up .  Well , let us hush it up , too . Its no good bothering about it . We licked them all right .  But its such a beastly thing for the house .  Then why the dickens do you want it to get about ? Surely the best thing you can do is to dry up and say nothing about it .  But something ought to be done .  Whats the good of troubling about a man like Sheen ? He never was any good , and this doesnt make him very much worse . Besides , hell probably be sick enough on his own account . I know I should , if Id done it . And , anyway , we dont know that he did do it .  Im certain he did . I could swear it was him .  Anyhow , for goodness sake let the thing drop .  All right . But I shall cut him .  Well , that would be punishment enough for anybody , whatever hed done . Fancy existence without your bright conversation . It doesnt bear thinking of . You do look a freak with that eye and that lump on your forehead . You ought to wear a mask .  That ear of yours , said Linton with satisfaction , will be about three times its ordinary size tomorrow . And it always was too large . Good night .  On his way back to Seymours Mason of Applebys , who was standing at his house gate imbibing fresh air , preparatory to going to bed , accosted him .  I say , Linton , he said , --hullo , you look a wreck , dont you!--I say , whats all this about your house ?  What about my house ?  Funking , and all that . Sheen , you know . Stanning has just been telling me .  Then he saw him , too! exclaimed Linton , involuntarily .  Oh , its true , then ? Did he really cut off like that ? Stanning said he did , but I wouldnt believe him at first . You arent going ? Good night .  So the thing was out . Linton had not counted on Stanning having seen what he and Dunstable had seen . It was impossible to hush it up now . The scutcheon of Seymours was definitely blotted . The name of the house was being held up to scorn in Applebys probably everywhere else as well . It was a nuisance , thought Linton , but it could not be helped . After all , it was a judgment on the house for harbouring such a specimen as Sheen .  In Seymours there was tumult and an impromptu indignation meeting . Stanning had gone to work scientifically . From the moment that , ducking under the guard of a sturdy town youth , he had caught sight of Sheen retreating from the fray , he had grasped the fact that here , ready-made , was his chance of working off his grudge against him . All he had to do was to spread the news abroad , and the school would do the rest . On his return from the town he had mentioned the facts of the case to one or two of the more garrulous members of his house , and they had passed it on to everybody they met during the interval in the middle of preparation . By the end of preparation half the school knew what had happened .  Seymours was furious . The senior day-room to a man condemned Sheen . The junior day-room was crimson in the face and incoherent . The demeanour of a junior in moments of excitement generally lacks that repose which marks the philosopher .  He ought to be kicked , shrilled Renford .  We shall get rotted by those kids in Dexters , moaned Harvey .  Disgracing the house! thundered Watson .  Lets go and chuck things at his door , suggested Renford .  A move was made to the passage in which Sheens study was situated , and , with divers groans and howls , the junior day-room hove football boots and cricket stumps at the door .  The success of the meeting , however , was entirely neutralised by the fact that in the same passage stood the study of Rigby , the head of the house . Also Rigby was trying at the moment to turn into idiomatic Greek verse the words: The Days of Peace and Slumberous calm have fled , and this corroboration of the statement annoyed him to the extent of causing him to dash out and sow lines among the revellers like some monarch scattering largesse . The junior day-room retired to its lair to inveigh against the brutal ways of those in authority , and begin working off the commission it had received .  The howls in the passage were the first official intimation Sheen had received that his shortcomings were public property . The word Funk! shouted through his keyhole , had not unnaturally given him an inkling as to the state of affairs .  So Drummond had given him away , he thought . Probably he had told Linton the whole story the moment after he , Sheen , had met the latter at the door of the study . And perhaps he was now telling it to the rest of the house . Of all the mixed sensations from which he suffered as he went to his dormitory that night , one of resentment against Drummond was the keenest .  Sheen was in the fourth dormitory , where the majority of the day-room slept . He was in the position of a sort of extra house prefect , as far as the dormitory was concerned . It was a large dormitory , and Mr Seymour had fancied that it might , perhaps , be something of a handful for a single prefect . As a matter of fact , however , Drummond , who was in charge , had shown early in the term that he was more than capable of managing the place single handed . He was popular and determined . The dormitory was orderly , partly because it liked him , principally because it had to be .  He had an opportunity of exhibiting his powers of control that night . When Sheen came in , the room was full . Drummond was in bed , reading his novel . The other ornaments of the dormitory were in various stages of undress .  As Sheen appeared , a sudden hissing broke out from the farther corner of the room . Sheen flushed , and walked to his bed . The hissing increased in volume and richness .  Shut up that noise , said Drummond , without looking up from his book .  The hissing diminished . Only two or three of the more reckless kept it up .  Drummond looked across the room at them .  Stop that noise , and get into bed , he said quietly .  The hissing ceased . He went on with his book again .  Silence reigned in dormitory four .     VI  ALBERT REDIVIVUS   By murdering in cold blood a large and respected family , and afterwards depositing their bodies in a reservoir , one may gain , we are told , much unpopularity in the neighbourhood of ones crime; while robbing a church will get one cordially disliked especially by the vicar . But , to be really an outcast , to feel that one has no friend in the world , one must break an important public-school commandment .  Sheen had always been something of a hermit . In his most sociable moments he had never had more than one or two friends; but he had never before known what it meant to be completely isolated . It was like living in a world of ghosts , or , rather , like being a ghost in a living world . That disagreeable experience of being looked through , as if one were invisible , comes to the average person , it may be half a dozen times in his life . Sheen had to put up with it a hundred times a day . People who were talking to one another stopped when he appeared and waited until he had passed on before beginning again . Altogether , he was made to feel that he had done for himself , that , as far as the life of the school was concerned , he did not exist .  There had been some talk , particularly in the senior day-room , of more active measures . It was thought that nothing less than a court-martial could meet the case . But the house prefects had been against it . Sheen was in the sixth , and , however monstrous and unspeakable might have been his acts , it would hardly do to treat him as if he were a junior . And the scheme had been definitely discouraged by Drummond , who had stated , without wrapping the gist of his remarks in elusive phrases , that in the event of a court-martial being held he would interview the president of the same and knock his head off . So Seymours had fallen back on the punishment which from their earliest beginnings the public schools have meted out to their criminals . They had cut Sheen dead .  In a way Sheen benefited from this excommunication . Now that he could not even play fives , for want of an opponent , there was nothing left for him to do but work . Fortunately , he had an object . The Gotford would be coming on in a few weeks , and the more work he could do for it , the better . Though Stanning was the only one of his rivals whom he feared , and though he was known to be taking very little trouble over the matter , it was best to run as few risks as possible . Stanning was one of those people who produce great results in their work without seeming to do anything for them .  So Sheen shut himself up in his study and ground grimly away at his books , and for exercise went for cross-country walks . It was a monotonous kind of existence . For the space of a week the only Wrykinian who spoke a single word to him was Bruce , the son of the Conservative candidate for Wrykyn: and Bruces conversation had been limited to two remarks . He had said , You might play that again , will you ? and , later , Thanks . He had come into the music-room while Sheen was practising one afternoon , and had sat down , without speaking , on a chair by the door . When Sheen had played for the second time the piece which had won his approval , Bruce thanked him and left the room . As the solitary break in the monotony of the week , Sheen remembered the incident rather vividly .  Since the great rout of Albert and his minions outside Cooks , things , as far as the seniors were concerned , had been quiet between school and town . Linton and Dunstable had gone to and from Cooks two days in succession without let or hindrance . It was generally believed that , owing to the unerring way in which he had put his head in front of Drummonds left on that memorable occasion , the scarlet-haired one was at present dry-docked for repairs . The story in the school--it had grown with the days--was that Drummond had laid the enemy out on the pavement with a sickening crash , and that he had still been there at , so to speak , the close of play . As a matter of fact , Albert was in excellent shape , and only an unfortunate previous engagement prevented him from ranging the streets near Cooks as before . Sir William Bruce was addressing a meeting in another part of the town , and Albert thought it his duty to be on hand to boo .  In the junior portion of the school the feud with the town was brisk . Mention has been made of a certain St Judes , between which seat of learning and the fags of Dexters and the School House there was a spirited vendetta .  Jackson , of Dexters was one of the pillars of the movement . Jackson was                     a calm-browd lad ,     Yet mad , at moments , as a hatter ,  and he derived a great deal of pleasure from warring against St Judes . It helped him to enjoy his meals . He slept the better for it . After a little turn up with a Judy he was fuller of that spirit of manly fortitude and forbearance so necessary to those whom Fate brought frequently into contact with Mr Dexter . The Judies wore mortar-boards , and it was an enjoyable pastime sending these spinning into space during one of the usual rencontres in the High Street . From the fact that he and his friends were invariably outnumbered , there was a sporting element in these affairs , though occasionally this inferiority of numbers was the cause of his executing a scientific retreat with the enemy harassing his men up to the very edge of the town . This had happened on the last occasion . There had been casualties . No fewer than six house-caps had fallen into the enemys hands , and he himself had been tripped up and rolled in a puddle .  He burned to avenge this disaster .  Coming down to Cooks ? he said to his ally , Painter . It was just a week since the Sheen episode .  All right , said Painter .  Suppose we go by the High Street , suggested Jackson , casually .  Then wed better get a few more chaps , said Painter .  A few more chaps were collected , and the party , numbering eight , set off for the town . There were present such stalwarts as Borwick and Crowle , both of Dexters , and Tomlin , of the School House , a useful man to have by you in an emergency . It was Tomlin who , on one occasion , attacked by two terrific champions of St Judes in a narrow passage , had vanquished them both , and sent their mortar-boards miles into the empyrean , so that they were never the same mortar-boards again , but wore ever after a bruised and draggled look .  The expedition passed down the High Street without adventure , until , by common consent , it stopped at the lofty wall which bounded the playground of St Judes .  From the other side of the wall came sounds of revelry , shrill squealings and shoutings . The Judies were disporting themselves at one of their weird games . It was known that they played touch-last , and Scandal said that another of their favourite recreations was marbles . The juniors at Wrykyn believed that it was to hide these excesses from the gaze of the public that the playground wall had been made so high . Eye-witnesses , who had peeped through the door in the said wall , reported that what the Judies seemed to do mostly was to chase one another about the playground , shrieking at the top of their voices . But , they added , this was probably a mere ruse to divert suspicion .  They had almost certainly got the marbles in their pockets all the time .  The expedition stopped , and looked itself in the face .  How about buzzing something at them ? said Jackson earnestly .  You can get oranges over the road , said Tomlin in his helpful way .  Jackson vanished into the shop indicated , and reappeared a few moments later with a brown paper bag .  It seems a beastly waste , suggested the economical Painter .  Thats all right , said Jackson , theyre all bad . The man thought I was rotting him when I asked if hed got any bad oranges , but I got them at last . Give us a leg up , some one .  Willing hands urged him to the top of the wall . He drew out a green orange , and threw it .  There was a sudden silence on the other side of the wall . Then a howl of wrath went up to the heavens . Jackson rapidly emptied his bag .  Got him! he exclaimed , as the last orange sped on its way . Look out , theyre coming!  The expedition had begun to move off with quiet dignity , when from the doorway in the wall there poured forth a stream of mortar-boarded warriors , shrieking defiance . The expedition advanced to meet them .  As usual , the Judies had the advantage in numbers , and , filled to the brim with righteous indignation , they were proceeding to make things uncommonly warm for the invaders--Painter had lost his cap , and Tomlin three waistcoat buttons--when the eye of Jackson , roving up and down the street , was caught by a Seymours cap . He was about to shout for assistance when he perceived that the newcomer was Sheen , and refrained . It was no use , he felt , asking Sheen for help .  But just as Sheen arrived and the ranks of the expedition were beginning to give way before the strenuous onslaught of the Judies , the latter , almost with one accord , turned and bolted into their playground again . Looking round , Tomlin , that first of generals , saw the reason , and uttered a warning .  A mutual foe had appeared . From a passage on the left of the road there had debouched on to the field of action Albert himself and two of his band .  The expedition flew without false shame . It is to be doubted whether one of Alberts calibre would have troubled to attack such small game , but it was the firm opinion of the Wrykyn fags and the Judies that he and his men were to be avoided .  The newcomers did not pursue them . They contented themselves with shouting at them . One of the band threw a stone .  Then they caught sight of Sheen .  Albert said , Oo er! and advanced at the double . His companions followed him .  Sheen watched them come , and backed against the wall . His heart was thumping furiously . He was in for it now , he felt . He had come down to the town with this very situation in his mind . A wild idea of doing something to restore his self-respect and his credit in the eyes of the house had driven him to the High Street . But now that the crisis had actually arrived , he would have given much to have been in his study again .  Albert was quite close now . Sheen could see the marks which had resulted from his interview with Drummond . With all his force Sheen hit out , and experienced a curious thrill as his fist went home . It was a poor blow from a scientific point of view , but Sheens fives had given him muscle , and it checked Albert . That youth , however , recovered rapidly , and the next few moments passed in a whirl for Sheen . He received a stinging blow on his left ear , and another which deprived him of his whole stock of breath , and then he was on the ground , conscious only of a wish to stay there for ever .     VII  MR JOE BEVAN   Almost involuntarily he staggered up to receive another blow which sent him down again .  Thatll do , said a voice .  Sheen got up , panting . Between him and his assailant stood a short , sturdy man in a tweed suit . He was waving Albert back , and Albert appeared to be dissatisfied . He was arguing hotly with the newcomer .  Now , you go away , said that worthy , mildly , just you go away .  Albert gave it as his opinion that the speaker would do well not to come interfering in what didnt concern him . What he wanted , asserted Albert , was a thick ear .  Coming pushing yourself in , added Albert querulously .  You go away , repeated the stranger . You go away . I dont want to have trouble with you .  Alberts reply was to hit out with his left hand in the direction of the speakers face . The stranger , without fuss , touched the back of Alberts wrist gently with the palm of his right hand , and Albert , turning round in a circle , ended the manoeuvre with his back towards his opponent . He faced round again irresolutely . The thing had surprised him .  You go away , said the other , as if he were making the observation for the first time .  Its Joe Bevan , said one of Alberts friends , excitedly .  Alberts jaw fell . His freckled face paled .  You go away , repeated the man in the tweed suit , whose conversation seemed inclined to run in a groove .  This time Albert took the advice . His friends had already taken it .  Thanks , said Sheen .  Beware , said Mr Bevan oracularly , of entrance to a quarrel; but , being in , beart that th opposed may beware of thee . Always counter back when you guard . When a man shows you his right like that , always push out your hand straight . The straight left rules the boxing world . Feeling better , sir ?  Yes , thanks .  He got that right in just on the spot . I was watching . When you see a man coming to hit you with his right like that , dont you draw back . Get on top of him . He cant hit you then .  That feeling of utter collapse , which is the immediate result of a blow in the parts about the waistcoat , was beginning to pass away , and Sheen now felt capable of taking an interest in sublunary matters once more . His ear smarted horribly , and when he put up a hand and felt it the pain was so great that he could barely refrain from uttering a cry . But , however physically battered he might be , he was feeling happier and more satisfied with himself than he had felt for years . He had been beaten , but he had fought his best , and not given in . Some portion of his self-respect came back to him as he reviewed the late encounter .  Mr Bevan regarded him approvingly .  He was too heavy for you , he said . Hes a good twelve stone , I make it . I should put you at ten stone--say ten stone three . Call it nine stone twelve in condition . But youve got pluck , sir .  Sheen opened his eyes at this surprising statement .  Some Ive met would have laid down after getting that first hit , but you got up again . Thats the secret of fighting . Always keep going on . Never give in . You know what Shakespeare says about the one who first cries , Hold , enough! Do you read Shakespeare , sir ?  Yes , said Sheen .  Ah , now he knew his business , said Mr Bevan enthusiastically . There was ring-craft , as you may say . He wasnt a novice .  Sheen agreed that Shakespeare had written some good things in his time .  Thats what you want to remember . Always keep going on , as the saying is . I was fighting Dick Roberts at the National--an American , he was , from San Francisco . He come at me with his right stretched out , and I think hes going to hit me with it , when blessed if his left dont come out instead , and , my Golly! it nearly knocked a passage through me . Just where that fellow hit you , sir , he hit me . It was just at the end of the round , and I went back to my corner . Jim Blake was seconding me . Whats this , Jim ? I says , is the man mad , or what ? Why , he says , hes left-handed , thats whats the matter . Get on top of him . Get on top of him ? I says . My Golly , Ill get on top of the roof if hes going to hit me another of those . But I kept on , and got close to him , and he couldnt get in another of them , and he give in after the seventh round .  What competition was that ? asked Sheen .  Mr Bevan laughed . It was a twenty-round contest , sir , for seven-fifty aside and the Light Weight Championship of the World .  Sheen looked at him in astonishment . He had always imagined professional pugilists to be bullet-headed and beetle-browed to a man . He was not prepared for one of Mr Joe Bevans description . For all the marks of his profession that he bore on his face , in the shape of lumps and scars , he might have been a curate . His face looked tough , and his eyes harboured always a curiously alert , questioning expression , as if he were perpetually sizing up the person he was addressing . But otherwise he was like other men . He seemed also to have a pretty taste in Literature . This , combined with his strong and capable air , attracted Sheen . Usually he was shy and ill at ease with strangers . Joe Bevan he felt he had known all his life .  Do you still fight ? he asked .  No , said Mr Bevan , I gave it up . A man finds hes getting on , as the saying is , and it dont do to keep at it too long . I teach and I train , but I dont fight now .  A sudden idea flashed across Sheens mind . He was still glowing with that pride which those who are accustomed to work with their brains feel when they have gone honestly through some labour of the hands . At that moment he felt himself capable of fighting the world and beating it . The small point , that Albert had knocked him out of time in less than a minute , did not damp him at all . He had started on the right road . He had done something . He had stood up to his man till he could stand no longer . An unlimited vista of action stretched before him . He had tasted the pleasure of the fight , and he wanted more .  Why , he thought , should he not avail himself of Joe Bevans services to help him put himself right in the eyes of the house ? At the end of the term , shortly before the Public Schools Competitions at Aldershot , inter-house boxing cups were competed for at Wrykyn . It would be a dramatic act of reparation to the house if he could win the Light-Weight cup for it . His imagination , jumping wide gaps , did not admit the possibility of his not being good enough to win it . In the scene which he conjured up in his mind he was an easy victor . After all , there was the greater part of the term to learn in , and he would have a Champion of the World to teach him .  Mr Bevan cut in on his reflections as if he had heard them by some process of wireless telegraphy .  Now , look here , sir , he said , you should let me give you a few lessons . Youre plucky , but you dont know the game as yet . And boxings a thing every one ought to know . Supposition is , youre crossing a field or going down a street with your sweetheart or your wife--  Sheen was neither engaged nor married , but he let the point pass .  --And up comes one of these hooligans , as they call em . What are you going to do if he starts his games ? Why , nothing , if you cant box . You may be plucky , but you cant beat him . And if you beat him , youll get half murdered yourself . What you want to do is to learn to box , and then what happens ? Why , as soon as he sees you shaping , he says to himself , Hullo , this chap knows too much for me . Im off , and off he runs . Or supposition is , he comes for you . You dont mind . Not you . You give him one punch in the right place , and then you go off to your tea , leaving him lying there . He wont get up .  Id like to learn , said Sheen . I should be awfully obliged if youd teach me . I wonder if you could make me any good by the end of the term . The House Competitions come off then .  That all depends , sir . It comes easier to some than others . If you know how to shoot your left out straight , thats as good as six months teaching . After that its all ring-craft . The straight left beats the world .  Where shall I find you ?  Im training a young chap--eight stone seven , and hes got to get down to eight stone four , for a bantam weight match--at an inn up the river here . I daresay you know it , sir . Or any one would tell you where it is . The Blue Boar , its called . You come there any time you like to name , sir , and youll find me .  I should like to come every day , said Sheen . Would that be too often ?  Oftener the better , sir . You cant practise too much .  Then Ill start next week . Thanks very much . By the way , I shall have to go by boat , I suppose . It isnt far , is it ? Ive not been up the river for some time . The School generally goes down stream .  Its not what youd call far , said Bevan . But it would be easier for you to come by road .  I havent a bicycle .  Wouldnt one of your friends lend you one ?  Sheen flushed .  No , Id better come by boat , I think . Ill turn up on Tuesday at about five . Will that suit you ?  Yes , sir . That will be a good time . Then Ill say good bye , sir , for the present .  Sheen went back to his house in a different mood from the one in which he had left it . He did not care now when the other Seymourites looked through him .  In the passage he met Linton , and grinned pleasantly at him .  What the dickens was that man grinning at ? said Linton to himself . I must have a smut or something on my face .  But a close inspection in the dormitory looking-glass revealed no blemish on his handsome features .     VIII  A NAVAL BATTLE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES   What a go is life!  Let us examine the case of Jackson , of Dexters . OHara , who had left Dexters at the end of the summer term , had once complained to Clowes of the manner in which his house-master treated him , and Clowes had remarked in his melancholy way that it was nothing less than a breach of the law that Dexter should persist in leading a fellow a dogs life without a dog licence for him .  That was precisely how Jackson felt on the subject .  Things became definitely unbearable on the day after Sheens interview with Mr Joe Bevan .  Twas morn--to begin at the beginning--and Jackson sprang from his little cot to embark on the labours of the day . Unfortunately , he sprang ten minutes too late , and came down to breakfast about the time of the second slice of bread and marmalade . Result , a hundred lines . Proceeding to school , he had again fallen foul of his house-master--in whose form he was--over a matter of unprepared Livy . As a matter of fact , Jackson had prepared the Livy . Or , rather , he had not absolutely prepared it; but he had meant to . But it was Mr Templars preparation , and Mr Templar was short-sighted . Any one will understand , therefore , that it would have been simply chucking away the gifts of Providence if he had not gone on with the novel which he had been reading up till the last moment before prep-time , and had brought along with him accidentally , as it were . It was a book called A Spoiler of Men , by Richard Marsh , and there was a repulsive crime on nearly every page . It was Hot Stuff . Much better than Livy . . . .  Lunch Score--Two hundred lines .  During lunch he had the misfortune to upset a glass of water . Pure accident , of course , but there it was , dont you know , all over the table .  Mr Dexter had called him--      (a) clumsy;     (b) a pig;  and had given him      (1) Advice--You had better be careful , Jackson .     (2) A present--Two hundred lines , Jackson .  On the match being resumed at two oclock , with four hundred lines on the score-sheet , he had played a fine , free game during afternoon school , and Mr Dexter , who objected to fine , free games--or , indeed , any games--during school hours , had increased the total to six hundred , when stumps were drawn for the day .  So on a bright sunny Saturday afternoon , when he should have been out in the field cheering the house-team on to victory against the School House , Jackson sat in the junior day-room at Dexters copying out portions of Virgil , Aeneid Two .  To him , later on in the afternoon , when he had finished half his task , entered Painter , with the news that Dexters had taken thirty points off the School House just after half-time .  Mopped them up , said the terse and epigrammatic Painter . Made rings round them . Havent you finished yet ? Well , chuck it , and come out .  Whats on ? asked Jackson .  Were going to have a boat race .  Pile it on .  We are , really . Fact . Some of these School House kids are awfully sick about the match , and challenged us . That chap Tomlin thinks he can row .  He cant row for nuts , said Jackson . He doesnt know which end of the oar to shove into the water . Ive seen cats that could row better than Tomlin .  Thats what I told him . At least , I said he couldnt row for toffee , so he said all right , I bet I can lick you , and I said I betted he couldnt , and he said all right , then , lets try , and then the other chaps wanted to join in , so we made an inter-house thing of it . And I want you to come and stroke us .  Jackson hesitated . Mr Dexter , setting the lines on Friday , had certainly said that they were to be shown up tomorrow evening . He had said it very loud and clear . Still , in a case like this . . . . After all , by helping to beat the School House on the river he would be giving Dexters a leg-up . And what more could the man want ?  Right ho , said Jackson .  Down at the School boat-house the enemy were already afloat when Painter and Jackson arrived .  Buck up , cried the School House crew .  Dexters embarked , five strong . There was room for two on each seat . Jackson shared the post of stroke with Painter . Crowle steered .  Ready ? asked Tomlin from the other boat .  Half a sec . , said Jackson . Whats the course ?  Oh , dont you know that yet ? Up to the town , round the island just below the bridge ,--the island with the croquet ground on it , you know--and back again here . Ready ?  In a jiffy . Look here , Crowle , remember about steering . You pull the right line if you want to go to the right and the other if you want to go to the left .  All right , said the injured Crowle . As if I didnt know that .  Thought Id mention it . Its your fault . Nobody could tell by looking at you that you knew anything except how to eat . Ready , you chaps ?  When I say Three , said Tomlin .  It was a subject of heated discussion between the crews for weeks afterwards whether Dexters boat did or did not go off at the word Two . Opinions were divided on the topic . But it was certain that Jackson and his men led from the start . Pulling a good , splashing stroke which had drenched Crowle to the skin in the first thirty yards , Dexters boat crept slowly ahead . By the time the island was reached , it led by a length . Encouraged by success , the leaders redoubled their already energetic efforts . Crowle sat in a shower-bath . He was even moved to speech about it .  When youve finished , said Crowle .  Jackson , intent upon repartee , caught a crab , and the School House drew level again . The two boats passed the island abreast .  Just here occurred one of those unfortunate incidents . Both crews had quickened their stroke until the boats had practically been converted into submarines , and the rival coxswains were observing bitterly to space that this was jolly well the last time they ever let themselves in for this sort of thing , when round the island there hove in sight a flotilla of boats , directly in the path of the racers .  There were three of them , and not even the spray which played over them like a fountain could prevent Crowle from seeing that they were manned by Judies . Even on the river these outcasts wore their mortar-boards .  Look out! shrieked Crowle , pulling hard on his right line . Stop rowing , you chaps . We shall be into them .  At the same moment the School House oarsmen ceased pulling . The two boats came to a halt a few yards from the enemy .  Whats up ? panted Jackson , crimson from his exertions . Hullo , its the Judies!  Tomlin was parleying with the foe .  Why the dickens cant you keep out of the way ? Spoiling our race . Wait till we get ashore .  But the Judies , it seemed , were not prepared to wait even for that short space of time . A miscreant , larger than the common run of Judy , made a brief , but popular , address to his men .  Splash them! he said .  Instantly , amid shrieks of approval , oars began to strike the water , and the water began to fly over the Wrykyn boats , which were now surrounded . The latter were not slow to join battle with the same weapons . Homeric laughter came from the bridge above . The town bridge was a sort of loafers club , to which the entrance fee was a screw of tobacco , and the subscription an occasional remark upon the weather . Here gathered together day by day that section of the populace which resented it when they asked for employment , and only got work instead . From morn till eve they lounged against the balustrades , surveying nature , and hoping it would be kind enough to give them some excitement that day . An occasional dog-fight found in them an eager audience . No runaway horse ever bored them . A broken-down motor-car was meat and drink to them . They had an appetite for every spectacle .  When , therefore , the water began to fly from boat to boat , kind-hearted men fetched their friends from neighbouring public houses and craned with them over the parapet , observing the sport and commenting thereon . It was these comments that attracted Mr Dexters attention . When , cycling across the bridge , he found the south side of it entirely congested , and heard raucous voices urging certain unseen little uns now to go it and anon to vote for Pedder , his curiosity was aroused . He dismounted and pushed his way through the crowd until he got a clear view of what was happening below .  He was just in time to see the most stirring incident of the fight . The biggest of the Judy boats had been propelled by the current nearer and nearer to the Dexter Argo . No sooner was it within distance than Jackson , dropping his oar , grasped the side and pulled it towards him . The two boats crashed together and rocked violently as the crews rose from their seats and grappled with one another . A hurricane of laughter and applause went up from the crowd upon the bridge .  The next moment both boats were bottom upwards and drifting sluggishly down towards the island , while the crews swam like rats for the other boats .  Every Wrykinian had to learn to swim before he was allowed on the river; so that the peril of Jackson and his crew was not extreme: and it was soon speedily evident that swimming was also part of the Judy curriculum , for the shipwrecked ones were soon climbing drippingly on board the surviving ships , where they sat and made puddles , and shrieked defiance at their antagonists .  This was accepted by both sides as the end of the fight , and the combatants parted without further hostilities , each fleet believing that the victory was with them .  And Mr Dexter , mounting his bicycle again , rode home to tell the headmaster .  That evening , after preparation , the headmaster held a reception . Among distinguished visitors were Jackson , Painter , Tomlin , Crowle , and six others .  On the Monday morning the headmaster issued a manifesto to the school after prayers . He had , he said , for some time entertained the idea of placing the town out of bounds . He would do so now . No boy , unless he was a prefect , would be allowed till further notice to cross the town bridge . As regarded the river , for the future boating Wrykinians must confine their attentions to the lower river . Nobody must take a boat up-stream . The school boatman would have strict orders to see that this rule was rigidly enforced . Any breach of these bounds would , he concluded , be punished with the utmost severity .  The headmaster of Wrykyn was not a hasty man . He thought before he put his foot down . But when he did , he put it down heavily .  Sheen heard the ultimatum with dismay . He was a law-abiding person , and here he was , faced with a dilemma that made it necessary for him to choose between breaking school rules of the most important kind , or pulling down all the castles he had built in the air before the mortar had had time to harden between their stones .  He wished he could talk it over with somebody . But he had nobody with whom he could talk over anything . He must think it out for himself .  He spent the rest of the day thinking it out , and by nightfall he had come to his decision .  Even at the expense of breaking bounds and the risk of being caught at it , he must keep his appointment with Joe Bevan . It would mean going to the town landing-stage for a boat , thereby breaking bounds twice over .  But it would have to be done .     IX  SHEEN BEGINS HIS EDUCATION   The Blue Boar was a picturesque inn , standing on the bank of the river Severn . It was much frequented in the summer by fishermen , who spent their days in punts and their evenings in the old oak parlour , where a picture in boxing costume of Mr Joe Bevan , whose brother was the landlord of the inn , gazed austerely down on them , as if he disapproved of the lamentable want of truth displayed by the majority of their number . Artists also congregated there to paint the ivy-covered porch . At the back of the house were bedrooms , to which the fishermen would make their way in the small hours of a summer morning , arguing to the last as they stumbled upstairs . One of these bedrooms , larger than the others , had been converted into a gymnasium for the use of mine hosts brother . Thither he brought pugilistic aspirants who wished to be trained for various contests , and it was the boast of the Blue Boar that it had never turned out a loser . A reputation of this kind is a valuable asset to an inn , and the boxing world thought highly of it , in spite of the fact that it was off the beaten track . Certainly the luck of the Blue Boar had been surprising .  Sheen pulled steadily up stream on the appointed day , and after half an hours work found himself opposite the little landing-stage at the foot of the inn lawn .  His journey had not been free from adventure . On his way to the town he had almost run into Mr Templar , and but for the lucky accident of that gentlemans short sight must have been discovered . He had reached the landing-stage in safety , but he had not felt comfortable until he was well out of sight of the town . It was fortunate for him in the present case that he was being left so severely alone by the school . It was an advantage that nobody took the least interest in his goings and comings .  Having moored his boat and proceeded to the inn , he was directed upstairs by the landlord , who was an enlarged and coloured edition of his brother . From the other side of the gymnasium door came an unceasing and mysterious shuffling sound .  He tapped at the door and went in .  He found himself in a large , airy room , lit by two windows and a broad skylight . The floor was covered with linoleum . But it was the furniture that first attracted his attention . In a farther corner of the room was a circular wooden ceiling , supported by four narrow pillars . From the centre of this hung a ball , about the size of an ordinary football . To the left , suspended from a beam , was an enormous leather bolster . On the floor , underneath a table bearing several pairs of boxing-gloves , a skipping-rope , and some wooden dumb-bells , was something that looked like a dozen Association footballs rolled into one . All the rest of the room , a space some few yards square , was bare of furniture . In this space a small sweater-clad youth , with a head of light hair cropped very short , was darting about and ducking and hitting out with both hands at nothing , with such a serious , earnest expression on his face that Sheen could not help smiling . On a chair by one of the windows Mr Joe Bevan was sitting , with a watch in his hand .  As Sheen entered the room the earnest young man made a sudden dash at him . The next moment he seemed to be in a sort of heavy shower of fists . They whizzed past his ear , flashed up from below within an inch of his nose , and tapped him caressingly on the waistcoat . Just as the shower was at its heaviest his assailant darted away again , side-stepped an imaginary blow , ducked another , and came at him once more . None of the blows struck him , but it was with more than a little pleasure that he heard Joe Bevan call Time! and saw the active young gentleman sink panting into a seat .  You and your games , Francis! said Joe Bevan , reproachfully . This is a young gentleman from the college come for tuition .  Gentleman--wont mind--little joke--take it in spirit which is--meant , said Francis , jerkily .  Sheen hastened to assure him that he had not been offended .  You take your two minutes , Francis , said Mr Bevan , and then have a turn with the ball . Come this way , Mr--  Sheen .  Come this way , Mr Sheen , and Ill show you where to put on your things .  Sheen had brought his football clothes with him . He had not put them on for a year .  Thats the lad I was speaking of . Getting on prime , he is . Fit to fight for his life , as the saying is .  What was he doing when I came in ?  Oh , he always has three rounds like that every day . It teaches you to get about quick . You try it when you get back , Mr Sheen . Fancy youre fighting me .  Are you sure Im not interrupting you in the middle of your work ? asked Sheen .  Not at all , sir , not at all . I just have to rub him down , and give him his shower-bath , and then hes finished for the day .  Having donned his football clothes and returned to the gymnasium , Sheen found Francis in a chair , having his left leg vigorously rubbed by Mr Bevan .  You fon of dargs ? inquired Francis affably , looking up as he came in .  Sheen replied that he was , and , indeed , was possessed of one . The admission stimulated Francis , whose right leg was now under treatment , to a flood of conversation . He , it appeared , had always been one for dargs . Owned two . Answering to the names of Tim and Tom . Beggars for rats , yes . And plucked uns ? Well--he would like to see , would Francis , a dog that Tim or Tom would not stand up to . Clever , too . Why once--  Joe Bevan cut his soliloquy short at this point by leading him off to another room for his shower-bath; but before he went he expressed a desire to talk further with Sheen on the subject of dogs , and , learning that Sheen would be there every day , said he was glad to hear it . He added that for a brother dog-lover he did not mind stretching a point , so that , if ever Sheen wanted a couple of rounds any day , he , Francis , would see that he got them . This offer , it may be mentioned , Sheen accepted with gratitude , and the extra practice he acquired thereby was subsequently of the utmost use to him . Francis , as a boxer , excelled in what is known in pugilistic circles as shiftiness . That is to say , he had a number of ingenious ways of escaping out of tight corners; and these he taught Sheen , much to the latters profit .  But this was later , when the Wrykinian had passed those preliminary stages on which he was now to embark .  The art of teaching boxing really well is a gift , and it is given to but a few . It is largely a matter of personal magnetism , and , above all , sympathy . A man may be a fine boxer himself , up to every move of the game , and a champion of champions , but for all that he may not be a good teacher . If he has not the sympathy necessary for the appreciation of the difficulties experienced by the beginner , he cannot produce good results . A boxing instructor needs three qualities--skill , sympathy , and enthusiasm . Joe Bevan had all three , particularly enthusiasm . His heart was in his work , and he carried Sheen with him . Beautiful , sir , beautiful , he kept saying , as he guarded the blows; and Sheen , though too clever to be wholly deceived by the praise , for he knew perfectly well that his efforts up to the present had been anything but beautiful , was nevertheless encouraged , and put all he knew into his hits . Occasionally Joe Bevan would push out his left glove . Then , if Sheens guard was in the proper place and the push did not reach its destination , Joe would mutter a word of praise . If Sheen dropped his right hand , so that he failed to stop the blow , Bevan would observe , Keep that guard up , sir! with almost a pained intonation , as if he had been disappointed in a friend .  The constant repetition of this maxim gradually drove it into Sheens head , so that towards the end of the lesson he no longer lowered his right hand when he led with his left; and he felt the gentle pressure of Joe Bevans glove less frequently . At no stage of a pupils education did Joe Bevan hit him really hard , and in the first few lessons he could scarcely be said to hit him at all . He merely rested his glove against the pupils face . On the other hand , he was urgent in imploring the pupil to hit him as hard as he could .  Dont be too kind , sir , he would chant , I dont mind being hit . Let me have it . Dont flap . Put it in with some weight behind it . He was also fond of mentioning that extract from Polonius speech to Laertes , which he had quoted to Sheen on their first meeting .  Sheen finished his first lesson , feeling hotter than he had ever felt in his life .  Hullo , sir , youre out of condition , commented Mr Bevan . Have a bit of a rest .  Once more Sheen had learnt the lesson of his weakness . He could hardly realise that he had only begun to despise himself in the last fortnight . Before then , he had been , on the whole , satisfied with himself . He was brilliant at work , and would certainly get a scholarship at Oxford or Cambridge when the time came; and he had specialised in work to the exclusion of games . It is bad to specialise in games to the exclusion of work , but of the two courses the latter is probably the less injurious . One gains at least health by it .  But Sheen now understood thoroughly , what he ought to have learned from his study of the Classics , that the happy mean was the thing at which to strive . And for the future he meant to aim at it . He would get the Gotford , if he could , but also would he win the house boxing at his weight .  After he had rested he discovered the use of the big ball beneath the table . It was soft , but solid and heavy . By throwing this--the medicine-ball , as they call it in the profession--at Joe Bevan , and catching it , Sheen made himself very hot again , and did the muscles of his shoulders a great deal of good .  Thatll do for today , then , sir , said Joe Bevan . Have a good rub down tonight , or youll find yourself very stiff in the morning .  Well , do you think I shall be any good ? asked Sheen .  Youll do fine , sir . But remember what Shakespeare says .  About vaulting ambition ?  No , sir , no . I meant what Hamlet says to the players . Nor do not saw the air too much , with your hand , thus , but use all gently . Thats what youve got to remember in boxing , sir . Take it easy . Easy and cool does it , and the straight left beats the world .         *       *       *       *       *  Sheen paddled quietly back to the town with the stream , pondering over this advice . He felt that he had advanced another step . He was not foolish enough to believe that he knew anything about boxing as yet , but he felt that it would not be long before he did .     X  SHEENS PROGRESS   Sheen improved . He took to boxing as he had taken to fives . He found that his fives helped him . He could get about on his feet quickly , and his eye was trained to rapid work .  His second lesson was not encouraging . He found that he had learned just enough to make him stiff and awkward , and no more . But he kept on , and by the end of the first week Joe Bevan declared definitely that he would do , that he had the root of the matter in him , and now required only practice .  I wish you could see like I can how youre improving , he said at the end of the sixth lesson , as they were resting after five minutes exercise with the medicine-ball . I get four blows in on some of the gentlemen I teach to one what I get in on you . But its like riding . When you can trot , you look forward to when you can gallop . And when you can gallop , you cant see yourself getting on any further . But youre improving all the time .  But I cant gallop yet , said Sheen .  Well , no , not gallop exactly , but youve only had six lessons . Why , in another six weeks , if you come regular , you wont know yourself . Youll be making some of the young gentlemen at the college wish they had never been born . Youll make babies of them , thats what youll do .  Ill bet I couldnt , if Id learnt with some one else , said Sheen , sincerely . I dont believe I should have learnt a thing if Id gone to the school instructor .  Who is your school instructor , sir ?  A man named Jenkins . He used to be in the army .  Well , there , you see , thats what it is . I know old George Jenkins . He used to be a pretty good boxer in his time , but there! boxings a thing , like everything else , that moves with the times . We used to go about in iron trucks . Now we go in motor-cars . Just the same with boxing . What youre learning now is the sort of boxing that wins championship fights nowadays . Old George , well , he teaches you how to put your left out , but , my Golly , he doesnt know any tricks . He hasnt studied it same as I have . Its the ring-craft that wins battles . Now sir , if youre ready .  They put on the gloves again . When the round was over , Mr Bevan had further comments to make .  You dont hit hard enough , sir , he said . Dont flap . Let it come straight out with some weight behind it . You want to be earnest in the ring . The other mans going to do his best to hurt you , and youve got to stop him . One good punch is worth twenty taps . You hit him . And when youve hit him , dont you go back; you hit him again . Theyll only give you three rounds in any competition you go in for , so you want to do the work you can while youre at it .  As the days went by , Sheen began to imbibe some of Joe Bevans rugged philosophy of life . He began to understand that the world is a place where every man has to look after himself , and that it is the stronger hand that wins . That sentence from Hamlet which Joe Bevan was so fond of quoting practically summed up the whole duty of man--and boy too . One should not seek quarrels , but , being in , one should do ones best to ensure that ones opponent thought twice in future before seeking them . These afternoons at the Blue Boar were gradually giving Sheen what he had never before possessed--self-confidence . He was beginning to find that he was capable of something after all , that in an emergency he would be able to keep his end up . The feeling added a zest to all that he did . His work in school improved . He looked at the Gotford no longer as a prize which he would have to struggle to win . He felt that his rivals would have to struggle to win it from him .  After his twelfth lesson , when he had learned the ground-work of the art , and had begun to develop a style of his own , like some nervous batsman at cricket who does not show his true form till he has been at the wickets for several overs , the dog-loving Francis gave him a trial . This was a very different affair from his spars with Joe Bevan . Frank Hunt was one of the cleverest boxers at his weight in England , but he had not Joe Bevans gift of hitting gently . He probably imagined that he was merely tapping , and certainly his blows were not to be compared with those he delivered in the exercise of his professional duties; but , nevertheless , Sheen had never felt anything so painful before , not even in his passage of arms with Albert . He came out of the encounter with a swollen lip and a feeling that one of his ribs was broken , and he had not had the pleasure of landing a single blow upon his slippery antagonist , who flowed about the room like quicksilver . But he had not flinched , and the statement of Francis , as they shook hands , that he had done varry well , was as balm . Boxing is one of the few sports where the loser can feel the same thrill of triumph as the winner . There is no satisfaction equal to that which comes when one has forced oneself to go through an ordeal from which one would have liked to have escaped .  Capital , sir , capital , said Joe Bevan . I wanted to see whether you would lay down or not when you began to get a few punches . You did capitally , Mr Sheen .  I didnt hit him much , said Sheen with a laugh .  Never mind , sir , you got hit , which was just as good . Some of the gentlemen Ive taught wouldnt have taken half that . Theyre all right when theyre on top and winning , and to see them shape youd say to yourself , By George , heres a champion . But let em get a punch or two , and hullo! says you , whats this ? They dont like it . They lay down . But you kept on . Theres one thing , though , you want to keep that guard up when you duck . You slip him that way once . Very well . Next time hes waiting for you . He doesnt hit straight . He hooks you , and you dont want many of those .  Sheen enjoyed his surreptitious visits to the Blue Boar . Twice he escaped being caught in the most sensational way; and once Mr Spence , who looked after the Wrykyn cricket and gymnasium , and played everything equally well , nearly caused complications by inviting Sheen to play fives with him after school . Fortunately the Gotford afforded an excellent excuse . As the time for the examination drew near , those who had entered for it were accustomed to become hermits to a great extent , and to retire after school to work in their studies .  You mustnt overdo it , Sheen , said Mr Spence . You ought to get some exercise .  Oh , I do , sir , said Sheen . I still play fives , but I play before breakfast now .  He had had one or two games with Harrington of the School House , who did not care particularly whom he played with so long as his opponent was a useful man . Sheen being one of the few players in the school who were up to his form , Harrington ignored the cloud under which Sheen rested . When they met in the world outside the fives-courts Harrington was polite , but made no overtures of friendship . That , it may be mentioned , was the attitude of every one who did not actually cut Sheen . The exception was Jack Bruce , who had constituted himself audience to Sheen , when the latter was practising the piano , on two further occasions . But then Bruce was so silent by nature that for all practical purposes he might just as well have cut Sheen like the others .  We might have a game before breakfast some time , then , said Mr Spence .  He had noticed , being a master who did notice things , that Sheen appeared to have few friends , and had made up his mind that he would try and bring him out a little . Of the real facts of the case , he knew of course , nothing .  I should like to , sir , said Sheen .  Next Wednesday ?  All right , sir .  Ill be there at seven . If youre before me , you might get the second court , will you ?  The second court from the end nearest the boarding-house was the best of the half-dozen fives-courts at Wrykyn . After school sometimes you would see fags racing across the gravel to appropriate it for their masters . The rule was that whoever first pinned to the door a piece of paper with his name on it was the legal owner of the court-and it was a stirring sight to see a dozen fags fighting to get at the door . But before breakfast the court might be had with less trouble .         *       *       *       *       *  Meanwhile , Sheen paid his daily visits to the Blue Boar , losing flesh and gaining toughness with every lesson . The more he saw of Joe Bevan the more he liked him , and appreciated his strong , simple outlook on life . Shakespeare was a great bond between them . Sheen had always been a student of the Bard , and he and Joe would sit on the little verandah of the inn , looking over the river , until it was time for him to row back to the town , quoting passages at one another . Joe Bevans knowledge , of the plays , especially the tragedies , was wide , and at first inexplicable to Sheen . It was strange to hear him declaiming long speeches from Macbeth or Hamlet , and to think that he was by profession a pugilist . One evening he explained his curious erudition . In his youth , before he took to the ring in earnest , he had travelled with a Shakespearean repertory company . I never played a star part , he confessed , but I used to come on in the Battle of Bosworth and in Macbeths castle and what not . Ive been First Citizen sometimes . I was the carpenter in Julius Caesar . That was my biggest part . Truly sir , in respect of a fine workman , I am but , as you would say , a cobbler . But somehow the stage--well . . .you know what it is , sir . Leeds one week , Manchester the next , Brighton the week after , and travelling all Sunday . It wasnt quiet enough for me .  The idea of becoming a professional pugilist for the sake of peace and quiet tickled Sheen . But Ive always read Shakespeare ever since then , continued Mr Bevan , and I always shall read him .  It was on the next day that Mr Bevan made a suggestion which drew confidences from Sheen , in his turn .  What you want now , sir , he said , is to practise on someone of about your own form , as the saying is . Isnt there some gentleman friend of yours at the college who would come here with you ?  They were sitting on the verandah when he asked this question . It was growing dusk , and the evening seemed to invite confidences . Sheen , looking out across the river and avoiding his friends glance , explained just what it was that made it so difficult for him to produce a gentleman friend at that particular time . He could feel Mr Bevans eye upon him , but he went through with it till the thing was told--boldly , and with no attempt to smooth over any of the unpleasant points .  Never you mind , sir , said Mr Bevan consolingly , as he finished . We all lose our heads sometimes . Ive seen the way you stand up to Francis , and Ill eat--Ill eat the medicine-ball if youre not as plucky as anyone . Its simply a question of keeping your head . You wouldnt do a thing like that again , not you . Dont you worry yourself , sir . Were all alike when we get bustled . We dont know what were doing , and by the time weve put our hands up and got into shape , why , its all over , and there you are . Dont you worry yourself , sir .  Youre an awfully good sort , Joe , said Sheen gratefully .     XI  A SMALL INCIDENT   Failing a gentleman friend , Mr Bevan was obliged to do what he could by means of local talent . On Sheens next visit he was introduced to a burly youth of his own age , very taciturn , and apparently ferocious . He , it seemed , was the knife and boot boy at the Blue Boar , did a bit with the gloves , and was willing to spar with Sheen provided Mr Bevan made it all right with the guvnor; saw , that is so say , that he did not get into trouble for passing in unprofessional frivolity moments which should have been sacred to knives and boots . These terms having been agreed to , he put on the gloves .  For the first time since he had begun his lessons , Sheen experienced an attack of his old shyness and dislike of hurting other peoples feelings . He could not resist the thought that he had no grudge against the warden of the knives and boots . He hardly liked to hit him .  The other , however , did not share this prejudice . He rushed at Sheen with such determination , that almost the first warning the latter had that the contest had begun was the collision of the back of his head with the wall . Out in the middle of the room he did better , and was beginning to hold his own , in spite of a rousing thump on his left eye , when Joe Bevan called Time! A second round went off in much the same way . His guard was more often in the right place , and his leads less wild . At the conclusion of the round , pressure of business forced his opponent to depart , and Sheen wound up his lesson with a couple of minutes at the punching-ball . On the whole , he was pleased with his first spar with someone who was really doing his best and trying to hurt him . With Joe Bevan and Francis there was always the feeling that they were playing down to him . Joe Bevans gentle taps , in particular , were a little humiliating . But with his late opponent all had been serious . It had been a real test , and he had come through it very fairly . On the whole , he had taken more than he had given--his eye would look curious tomorrow--but already he had thought out a way of foiling the burly youths rushes . Next time he would really show his true form .  The morrow , on which Sheen expected his eye to look curious , was the day he had promised to play fives with Mr Spence . He hoped that at the early hour at which they had arranged to play it would not have reached its worst stage; but when he looked in the glass at a quarter to seven , he beheld a small ridge of purple beneath it . It was not large , nor did it interfere with his sight , but it was very visible . Mr Spence , however , was a sportsman , and had boxed himself in his time , so there was a chance that nothing would be said .  It was a raw , drizzly morning . There would probably be few fives-players before breakfast , and the capture of the second court should be easy . So it turned out . Nobody was about when Sheen arrived . He pinned his slip of paper to the door , and , after waiting for a short while for Mr Spence and finding the process chilly , went for a trot round the gymnasium to pass the time .  Mr Spence had not arrived during his absence , but somebody else had . At the door of the second court , gleaming in first-fifteen blazer , sweater , stockings , and honour-cap , stood Attell .  Sheen looked at Attell , and Attell looked through Sheen .  It was curious , thought Sheen , that Attell should be standing in the very doorway of court two . It seemed to suggest that he claimed some sort of ownership . On the other hand , there was his , Sheens , paper on the . . . . His eye happened to light on the cement flooring in front of the court . There was a crumpled ball of paper there .  When he had started for his run , there had been no such ball of paper .  Sheen picked it up and straightened it out . On it was written R . D . Sheen .  He looked up quickly . In addition to the far-away look , Attells face now wore a faint smile , as if he had seen something rather funny on the horizon . But he spake no word .  A curiously calm and contented feeling came upon Sheen . Here was something definite at last . He could do nothing , however much he might resent it , when fellows passed him by as if he did not exist; but when it came to removing his landmark . . . .  Would you mind shifting a bit ? he said very politely . I want to pin my paper on the door again . It seems to have fallen down .  Attells gaze shifted slowly from the horizon and gradually embraced Sheen .  Ive got this court , he said .  I think not , said Sheen silkily . I was here at ten to seven , and there was no paper on the door then . So I put mine up . If you move a little , Ill put it up again .  Go and find another court , if you want to play , said Attell , and if youve got anybody to play with , he added with a sneer . This is mine .  I think not , said Sheen .  Attell resumed his inspection of the horizon .  Attell , said Sheen .  Attell did not answer .  Sheen pushed him gently out of the way , and tore down the paper from the door .  Their eyes met . Attell , after a moments pause , came forward , half-menacing , half irresolute; and as he came Sheen hit him under the chin in the manner recommended by Mr Bevan .  When you upper-cut , Mr Bevan was wont to say , dont make it a swing . Just a half-arm jolts all you want .  It was certainly all Attell wanted . He was more than surprised . He was petrified . The sudden shock of the blow , coming as it did from so unexpected a quarter , deprived him of speech: which was , perhaps , fortunate for him , for what he would have said would hardly have commended itself to Mr Spence , who came up at this moment .  Well , Sheen , said Mr Spence , here you are . I hope I havent kept you waiting . What a morning! Youve got the court , I hope ?  Yes , sir , said Sheen .  He wondered if the master had seen the little episode which had taken place immediately before his arrival . Then he remembered that it had happened inside the court . It must have been over by the time Mr Spence had come upon the scene .  Are you waiting for somebody , Attell ? asked Mr Spence . Stanning ? He will be here directly . I passed him on the way .  Attell left the court , and they began their game .  Youve hurt your eye , Sheen , said Mr Spence , at the end of the first game . How did that happen ?  Boxing , sir , said Sheen .  Oh , replied Mr Spence , and to Sheens relief he did not pursue his inquiries .  Attell had wandered out across the gravel to meet Stanning .  Got that court ? inquired Stanning .  No .  You idiot , why on earth didnt you ? Its the only court worth playing in . Whos got it ?  Sheen .  Sheen! Stanning stopped dead . Do you mean to say you let a fool like Sheen take it from you! Why didnt you turn him out ?  I couldnt , said Attell . I was just going to when Spence came up . Hes playing Sheen this morning . I couldnt very well bag the court when a master wanted it .  I suppose not , said Stanning . What did Sheen say when you told him you wanted the court ?  This was getting near a phase of the subject which Attell was not eager to discuss .  Oh , he didnt say much , he said .  Did you do anything ? persisted Stanning .  Attell suddenly remembered having noticed that Sheen was wearing a black eye . This was obviously a thing to be turned to account .  I hit him in the eye , he said . Ill bet its coloured by school-time .  And sure enough , when school-tune arrived , there was Sheen with his face in the condition described , and Stanning hastened to spread abroad this sequel to the story of Sheens failings in the town battle . By the end of preparation it had got about the school that Sheen had cheeked Attell , that Attell had hit Sheen , and that Sheen had been afraid to hit him back . At the precise moment when Sheen was in the middle of a warm two-minute round with Francis at the Blue Boar , an indignation meeting was being held in the senior day-room at Seymours to discuss this latest disgrace to the house .  This is getting a bit too thick , was the general opinion . Moreover , it was universally agreed that something ought to be done . The feeling in the house against Sheen had been stirred to a dangerous pitch by this last episode . Seymours thought more of their reputation than any house in the school . For years past the house had led on the cricket and football field and off it . Sometimes other houses would actually win one of the cups , but , when this happened , Seymours was always their most dangerous rival . Other houses had their ups and downs , were very good one year and very bad the next; but Seymours had always managed to maintain a steady level of excellence . It always had a man or two in the School eleven and fifteen , generally supplied one of the School Racquets pair for Queens Club in the Easter vac . , and when this did not happen always had one of two of the Gym . Six or Shooting Eight , or a few men who had won scholarships at the Varsities . The pride of a house is almost keener than the pride of a school . From the first minute he entered the house a new boy was made to feel that , in coming to Seymours , he had accepted a responsibility that his reputation was not his own , but belonged to the house . If he did well , the glory would be Seymours glory . If he did badly , he would be sinning against the house .  This second story about Sheen , therefore , stirred Seymours to the extent of giving the house a resemblance to a hornets nest into which a stone had been hurled . After school that day the house literally hummed . The noise of the two day-rooms talking it over could be heard in the road outside . The only bar that stood between the outraged Seymourites and Sheen was Drummond . As had happened before , Drummond resolutely refused to allow anything in the shape of an active protest , and no argument would draw him from this unreasonable attitude , though why it was that he had taken it up he himself could not have said . Perhaps it was that rooted hatred a boxer instinctively acquires of anything in the shape of unfair play that influenced him . He revolted against the idea of a whole house banding together against one of its members .  So even this fresh provocation did not result in any active interference with Sheen; but it was decided that he must be cut even more thoroughly than before .  And about the time when this was resolved , Sheen was receiving the congratulations of Francis on having positively landed a blow upon him . It was an event which marked an epoch in his career .     XII  DUNSTABLE AND LINTON GO UP THE RIVER   There are some proud , spirited natures which resent rules and laws on principle as attempts to interfere with the rights of the citizen . As the Duchess in the play said of her son , who had had unpleasantness with the authorities at Eton because they had been trying to teach him things , Silwood is a sweet boy , but he will not stand the bearing-rein . Dunstable was also a sweet boy , but he , too , objected to the bearing-rein . And Linton was a sweet boy , and he had similar prejudices . And this placing of the town out of bounds struck both of them simultaneously as a distinct attempt on the part of the headmaster to apply the bearing-rein .  Its all very well to put it out of bounds for the kids , said Dunstable , firmly , but when it comes to Us--why , I never heard of such a thing .  Linton gave it as his opinion that such conduct was quite in a class of its own as regarded cool cheek .  It fairly sneaks , said Linton , with forced calm , the Garibaldi .  Kids , proceeded Dunstable , judicially , are idiots , and cant be expected to behave themselves down town . Put the show out of bounds to them if you like . But We--  We! echoed Linton .  The fact is , said Dunstable , its a beastly nuisance , but we shall have to go down town and up the river just to assert ourselves . We cant have the thin end of the wedge coming and spoiling our liberties . We may as well chuck life altogether if we arent able to go to the town whenever we like .  And Albert will be pining away , added Linton .         *       *       *       *       *  Hullo , young gentlemen , said the town boatman , when they presented themselves to him , what can I do for you ?  I know it seems strange , said Dunstable , but we want a boat . We are the Down-trodden British Schoolboys League for Demanding Liberty and seeing that We Get It . Have you a boat ?  The man said he believed he had a boat . In fact , now that he came to think of it , he rather fancied he had one or two . He proceeded to get one ready , and the two martyrs to the cause stepped in .  Dunstable settled himself in the stern , and collected the rudder-lines .  Hullo , said Linton , arent you going to row ?  It may be only my foolish fancy , replied Dunstable , but I rather think youre going to do that . Ill steer .  Beastly slacker , said Linton . Anyhow , how far are we going ? Im not going to pull all night .  If you row for about half an hour without exerting yourself--and I can trust you not to do that--and then look to your left , youll see a certain hostelry , if it hasnt moved since I was last there . Its called the Blue Boar . We will have tea there , and then Ill pull gently back , and that will end the programme .  Except being caught in the town by half the masters , said Linton . Still , Im not grumbling . This had to be done . Ready ?  Not just yet , said Dunstable , looking past Linton and up the landing-stage . Wait just one second . Here are some friends of ours .  Linton looked over his shoulder .  Albert! he cried .  And the who struck me divers blows in sundry places . Ah , theyve sighted us .  What are you going to do ? We cant have another scrap with them .  Far from it , said Dunstable gently . Hullo , Albert . And my friend in the moth-eaten bowler! This is well met .  You come out here , said Albert , pausing on the brink .  Why ? asked Dunstable .  You see what youll get .  But we dont want to see what well get . Youve got such a narrow mind , Albert--may I call you Bertie ? You seem to think that nobody has any pleasures except vulgar brawls . We are going to row up river , and think beautiful thoughts .  Albert was measuring with his eye the distance between the boat and landing-stage . It was not far . A sudden spring . . . .  If you want a fight , go up to the school and ask for Mr Drummond . Hes the gentlemen who sent you to hospital last time . Any time youre passing , Im sure hed--  Albert leaped .  But Linton had had him under observation , and , as he sprung , pushed vigorously with his oar . The gap between boat and shore widened in an instant , and Albert , failing to obtain a foothold on the boat , fell back , with a splash that sent a cascade over his friend and the boatman , into three feet of muddy water . By the time he had scrambled out , his enemies were moving pensively up-stream .  The boatman was annoyed .  Makin me wet and spoilin my paint--what yer mean by it ?  Me and my friend here we want a boat , said Albert , ignoring the main issue .  Want a boat! Then youll not get a boat . Spoil my cushions , too , would you ? What next , I wonder! You go to Smith and ask him for a boat . Perhaps he aint so particular about having his cushions--  Orl right , said Albert , orl right .  Mr Smith proved more complaisant , and a quarter of an hour after Dunstable and Linton had disappeared , Albert and his friend were on the water . Moist outside , Albert burned with a desire for Revenge . He meant to follow his men till he found them . It almost seemed as if there would be a repetition of the naval battle which had caused the town to be put out of bounds . Albert was a quick-tempered youth , and he had swallowed fully a pint of Severn water .         *       *       *       *       *  Dunstable and Linton sat for some time in the oak parlour of the Blue Boar . It was late when they went out . As they reached the waters edge Linton uttered a cry of consternation .  Whats up ? asked Dunstable . I wish you wouldnt do that so suddenly . It gives me a start . Do you feel bad ?  Great Scott! its gone .  The pain ?  Our boat . I tied it up to this post .  You cant have done . Whats that boat over there! That looks like ours .  No , it isnt . That was there when we came . I noticed it . I tied ours up here , to this post .  This is a shade awkward , said Dunstable thoughtfully . You must have tied it up jolly rottenly . It must have slipped away and gone down-stream . This is where we find ourselves in the cart . Right among the ribstons , by Jove . I feel like that Frenchman in the story , who lost his glasses just as he got to the top of the mountain , and missed the view . Altogezzer I do not vish I ad kom .  Im certain I tied it up all right . And--why , look! heres the rope still on the pole , just as I left it .  For the first time Dunstable seemed interested .  This is getting mysterious . Did we hire a rowing-boat or a submarine ? Theres something on the end of this rope . Give it a tug , and see . There , didnt you feel it ?  I do believe , said Linton in an awed voice , the things sunk .  They pulled at the rope together . The waters heaved and broke , and up came the nose of the boat , to sink back with a splash as they loosened their hold .  There are more things in Heaven and Earth-- said Dunstable , wiping his hands . If you ask me , I should say an enemy hath done this . A boat doesnt sink of its own accord .  Albert! said Linton . The blackguard must have followed us up and done it while we were at tea .  Thats about it , said Dunstable . And now--how about getting home ?  I suppose wed better walk . We shall be hours late for lock-up .  You , said Dunstable , may walk if you are fond of exercise and arent in a hurry . Personally , Im going back by river .  But--  That looks a good enough boat over there . Anyhow , we must make it do . One mustnt be particular for once .  But it belongs--what will the other fellow do ?  I cant help his troubles , said Dunstable mildly , having enough of my own . Coming ?         *       *       *       *       *  It was about ten minutes later that Sheen , approaching the waterside in quest of his boat , found no boat there . The time was a quarter to six , and lock-up was at six-thirty .     XIII  DEUS EX MACHINA   It did not occur to Sheen immediately that his boat had actually gone . The full beauty of the situation was some moments in coming home to him . At first he merely thought that somebody had moved it to another part of the bank , as the authorities at the inn had done once or twice in the past , to make room for the boats of fresh visitors . Walking along the lawn in search of it , he came upon the stake to which Dunstables submerged craft was attached . He gave the rope a tentative pull , and was surprised to find that there was a heavy drag on the end of it .  Then suddenly the truth flashed across him . Heavens! he cried , its sunk .  Joe Bevan and other allies lent their aid to the pulling . The lost boat came out of the river like some huge fish , and finally rested on the bank , oozing water and drenching the grass in all directions .  Joe Bevan stooped down , and examined it in the dim light .  Whats happened here , sir , he said , is that theres a plank gone from the bottom . Smashed clean out , it is . Not started it isnt . Smashed clean out . Thats what it is . Some one must have been here and done it .  Sheen looked at the boat , and saw that he was right . A plank in the middle had been splintered . It looked as if somebody had driven some heavy instrument into it . As a matter of fact , Albert had effected the job with the butt-end of an oar .  The damage was not ruinous . A carpenter could put the thing right at no great expense . But it would take time . And meanwhile the minutes were flying , and lock-up was now little more than half an hour away .  Whatll you do , sir ? asked Bevan .  That was just what Sheen was asking himself . What could he do ? The road to the school twisted and turned to such an extent that , though the distance from the Blue Boar to Seymours was only a couple of miles as the crow flies , he would have to cover double that distance unless he took a short cut across the fields . And if he took a short cut in the dark he was certain to lose himself . It was a choice of evils . The Blue Boar possessed but one horse and trap , and he had seen that driven away to the station in charge of a fishermans luggage half an hour before .  I shall have to walk , he said .  Its a long way . Youll be late , wont you ? said Mr Bevan .  It cant be helped . I suppose I shall . I wonder who smashed that boat , he added after a pause .  Passing through the inn on his way to the road , he made inquiries . It appeared that two young gentlemen from the school had been there to tea . They had arrived in a boat and gone away in a boat . Nobody else had come into the inn . Suspicion obviously rested upon them .  Do you remember anything about them ? asked Sheen .  Further details came out . One of the pair had worn a cap like Sheens . The others headgear , minutely described , showed him that its owner was a member of the school second eleven .  Sheen pursued the inquiry . He would be so late in any case that a minute or so more or less would make no material difference; and he was very anxious to find out , if possible , who it was that had placed him in this difficulty . He knew that he was unpopular in the school , but he had not looked for this sort of thing .  Then somebody suddenly remembered having heard one of the pair address the other by name .  What name ? asked Sheen .  His informant was not sure . Would it be Lindon ?  Linton , said Sheen .  That was it .  Sheen thanked him and departed , still puzzled . Linton , as he knew him , was not the sort of fellow to do a thing like that . And the other , the second eleven man , must be Dunstable . They were always about together . He did not know much about Dunstable , but he could hardly believe that this sort of thing was his form either . Well , he would have to think of that later . He must concentrate himself now on covering the distance to the school in the minimum of time . He looked at his watch . Twenty minutes more . If he hurried , he might not be so very late . He wished that somebody would come by in a cart , and give him a lift .  He stopped and listened . No sound of horses hoof broke the silence . He walked on again .  Then , faint at first , but growing stronger every instant , there came from some point in the road far behind him a steady droning sound . He almost shouted with joy . A motor! Even now he might do it .  But could he stop it ? Would the motorist pay any attention to him , or would he flash past and leave him in the dust ? From the rate at which the drone increased the car seemed to be travelling at a rare speed .  He moved to one side of the road , and waited . He could see the lights now , flying towards him .  Then , as the car hummed past , he recognised its driver , and put all he knew into a shout .  Bruce! he cried .  For a moment it seemed as if he had not been heard . The driver paid not the smallest attention , as far as he could see . He looked neither to the left nor to right . Then the car slowed down , and , backing , came slowly to where he stood .  Hullo , said the driver , whos that ?  Jack Bruce was alone in the car , muffled to the eyes in an overcoat . It was more by his general appearance than his face that Sheen had recognised him .  Its me , Sheen . I say , Bruce , I wish youd give me a lift to Seymours , will you ?  There was never any waste of words about Jack Bruce . Of all the six hundred and thirty-four boys at Wrykyn he was probably the only one whose next remark in such circumstances would not have been a question . Bruce seldom asked questions--never , if they wasted time .  Hop in , he said .  Sheen consulted his watch again .  Lock-ups in a quarter of an hour , he said , but they give us ten minutes grace . That allows us plenty of time , doesnt it ?  Do it in seven minutes , if you like .  Dont hurry , said Sheen . Ive never been in a motor before , and I dont want to cut the experience short . Its awfully good of you to give me a lift .  Thats all right , said Bruce .  Were you going anywhere ? Am I taking you out of your way ?  No . I was just trying the car . Its a new one . The paters just got it .  Do you do much of this ? said Sheen .  Good bit . Im going in for the motor business when I leave school .  So all this is training ?  Thats it .  There was a pause .  You seemed to be going at a good pace just now , said Sheen .  About thirty miles an hour . She can move all right .  Thats faster than youre allowed to go , isnt it ?  Yes .  Youve never been caught , have you ?  Not yet . I want to see how much pace I can get out of her , because shell be useful when the election really comes on . Bringing voters to the poll , you know . Thats why the pater bought this new car . Its a beauty . His others only a little runabout .  Doesnt your father mind your motoring ?  Likes it , said Jack Bruce .  It seemed to Sheen that it was about time that he volunteered some information about himself , instead of plying his companion with questions . It was pleasant talking to a Wrykinian again; and Jack Bruce had apparently either not heard of the Albert incident , or else he was not influenced by it in any way .  Youve got me out of an awful hole , Bruce , he began .  Thats all right . Been out for a walk ?  Id been to the Blue Boar .  Oh! said Bruce . He did not seem to wish to know why Sheen had been there .  Sheen proceeded to explain .  I suppose youve heard all about me , he said uncomfortably . About the town , you know . That fight . Not joining in .  Heard something about it , said Bruce .  I went down town again after that , said Sheen , and met the same fellows who were fighting Linton and the others . They came for me , and I was getting awfully mauled when Joe Bevan turned up .  Oh , is Joe back again ?  Do you know him ? asked Sheen in surprise .  Oh yes . I used to go to the Blue Boar to learn boxing from him all last summer holidays .  Did you really ? Why , thats what Im doing now .  Good man , said Bruce .  Isnt he a splendid teacher ?  Ripping .  But I didnt know you boxed , Bruce . You never went in for any of the School competitions .  Im rather a rotten weight . Ten six . Too heavy for the Light-Weights and not heavy enough for the Middles . Besides , the competitions here are really inter-house . They dont want day-boys going in for them . Are you going to box for Seymours ?  Thats what I want to do . You see , it would be rather a score , wouldnt it ? After whats happened , you know .  I suppose it would .  I should like to do something . Its not very pleasant , he added , with a forced laugh , being considered a disgrace to the house , and cut by everyone .  Suppose not .  The difficulty is Drummond . You see , we are both the same weight , and hes much better than I am . Im hoping that hell go in for the Middles and let me take the Light-Weights . Theres nobody he couldnt beat in the Middles , though he would be giving away a stone .  Have you asked him ?  Not yet . I want to keep it dark that Im learning to box , just at present .  Spring it on them suddenly ?  Yes . Of course , I cant let it get about that I go to Joe Bevan , because I have to break bounds every time I do it .  The upper rivers out of bounds now for boarders , isnt it ?  Yes .  Jack Bruce sat in silence for a while , his gaze concentrated on the road in front of him .  Why go by river at all ? he said at last . If you like , Ill run you to the Blue Boar in the motor every day .  Oh , I say , thats awfully decent of you , said Sheen .  I should like to see old Joe again . I think Ill come and spar , too . If youre learning , what you want more than anything is somebody your own size to box with .  Thats just what Joe was saying . Will you really ? I should be awfully glad if you would . Boxing with Joe is all right , but you feel all the time hes fooling with you . I should like to try how I got on with somebody else .  Youd better meet me here , then , as soon after school as you can .  As he spoke , the car stopped .  Where are we ? asked Sheen .  Just at the corner of the road behind the houses .  Oh , I know . Hullo , there goes the lock-up bell . I shall do it comfortably .  He jumped down .  I say , Bruce , he said , I really am most awfully obliged for the lift . Something went wrong with my boat , and I couldnt get back in it . I should have been frightfully in the cart if you hadnt come by .  Thats all right , said Jack Bruce . I say , Sheen!  Hullo ?  Are you going to practise in the music-room after morning school tomorrow ?  Yes . Why ?  I think Ill turn up .  I wish you would .  Whats that thing that goes like this ? I forget most of it .  He whistled a few bars .  Thats a thing of Greigs , said Sheen .  You might play it tomorrow , said Bruce .  Rather . Of course I will .  Thanks , said Jack Bruce . Good night .  He turned the car , and vanished down the road . From the sound Sheen judged that he was once more travelling at a higher rate of speed than the local police would have approved .     XIV  A SKIRMISH   Upon consideration Sheen determined to see Linton about that small matter of the boat without delay . After prayers that night he went to his study .  Can I speak to you for a minute , Linton ? he said .  Linton was surprised . He disapproved of this intrusion . When a fellow is being cut by the house , he ought , by all the laws of school etiquette , to behave as such , and not speak till he is spoken to .  What do you want ? asked Linton .  I shant keep you long . Do you think you could put away that book for a minute , and listen ?  Linton hesitated , then shut the book .  Hurry up , then , he said .  I was going to , said Sheen . I simply came in to tell you that I know perfectly well who sunk my boat this afternoon .  He felt at once that he had now got Lintons undivided attention .  Your boat! said Linton . You dont mean to say that was yours! What on earth were you doing at the place ?  I dont think thats any business of yours , is it , Linton ?  How did you get back ?  I dont think thats any business of yours , either . I daresay youre disappointed , but I did manage to get back . In time for lock-up , too .  But I dont understand . Do you mean to say that that was your boat we took ?  Sunk , corrected Sheen .  Dont be a fool , Sheen . What the dickens should we want to sink your boat for ? What happened was this . Albert--you remember Albert ?--followed us up to the inn , and smashed our boat while we were having tea . When we got out and found it sunk , we bagged the only other one we could see . We hadnt a notion it was yours . We thought it belonged to some fisherman chap .  Then you didnt sink my boat ?  Of course we didnt . What do you take us for ?  Sorry , said Sheen . I thought it was a queer thing for you to have done . Im glad it wasnt you . Good night .  But look here , said Linton , dont go . It must have landed you in a frightful hole , didnt it ?  A little . But it doesnt matter . Good night .  But half a second , Sheen--  Sheen had disappeared .  Linton sat on till lights were turned off , ruminating . He had a very tender conscience where other members of the school were concerned , though it was tougher as regarded masters; and he was full of remorse at the thought of how nearly he had got Sheen into trouble by borrowing his boat that afternoon . It seemed to him that it was his duty to make it up to him in some way .  It was characteristic of Linton that the episode did not , in any way , alter his attitude towards Sheen . Another boy in a similar position might have become effusively friendly . Linton looked on the affair in a calm , judicial spirit . He had done Sheen a bad turn , but that was no reason why he should fling himself on his neck and swear eternal friendship . His demeanour on the occasions when they came in contact with each other remained the same . He did not speak to him , and he did not seem to see him . But all the while he was remembering that somehow or other he must do him a good turn of some sort , by way of levelling things up again . When that good turn had been done , he might dismiss him from his thoughts altogether .  Sheen , for his part , made no attempt to trade on the matter of the boat . He seemed as little anxious to be friendly with Linton as Linton was to be friendly with him . For this Linton was grateful , and continued to keep his eyes open in the hope of finding some opportunity of squaring up matters between them .  His chance was not long in coming . The feeling in the house against Sheen , caused by the story of his encounter with Attell , had not diminished . Stanning had fostered it in various little ways . It was not difficult . When a house of the standing in the school which Seymours possessed exhibits a weak spot , the rest of the school do not require a great deal of encouragement to go on prodding that weak spot . In short , the school rotted Seymours about Sheen , and Seymours raged impotently . Fags of other houses expended much crude satire on Seymours fags , and even the seniors of the house came in for their share of the baiting . Most of the houses at Wrykyn were jealous of Seymours , and this struck them as an admirable opportunity of getting something of their own back .  One afternoon , not long after Sheens conversation with Linton , Stanning came into Seymours senior day-room and sat down on the table . The senior day-room objected to members of other houses coming and sitting on their table as if they had bought that rickety piece of furniture; but Stannings reputation as a bruiser kept their resentment within bounds .  Hullo , you chaps , said Stanning .  The members of the senior day-room made no reply , but continued , as Mr Kipling has it , to persecute their vocations . Most of them were brewing . They went on brewing with the earnest concentration of chefs .  Youre a cheery lot , said Stanning . But I dont wonder youve got the hump . I should be a bit sick if wed got a skunk like that in our house . Heard the latest ?  Some lunatic said , No . What ? thereby delivering the day-room bound into the hands of the enemy .  Sheens apologised to Attell .  There was a sensation in the senior day-room , as Stanning had expected . He knew his men . He was perfectly aware that any story which centred round Sheens cowardice would be believed by them , so he had not troubled to invent a lie which it would be difficult to disprove . He knew that in the present state of feeling in the house Sheen would not be given a hearing .  No! shouted the senior day-room .  This was the last straw . The fellow seemed to go out of his way to lower the prestige of the house .  Fact , said Stanning . I thought you knew .  He continued to sit on the table , swinging his legs , while the full horror of his story sunk into the senior day-room mind .  I wonder you dont do something about it . Why dont you touch him up ? Hes not a prefect .  But they were not prepared to go to that length . The senior day-room had a great respect both for Drummonds word and his skill with his hands . He had said he would slay any one who touched Sheen , and they were of opinion that he would do it .  He isnt in , said one of the brewers , looking up from his toasting-fork . His study door was open when I passed .  I say , why not rag his study ? suggested another thickly , through a mouthful of toast .  Stanning smiled .  Good idea , he said .  It struck him that some small upheaval of Sheens study furniture , coupled with the burning of one or two books , might check to some extent that students work for the Gotford . And if Sheen could be stopped working for the Gotford , he , Stanning , would romp home . In the matter of brilliance there was no comparison between them . It was Sheens painful habit of work which made him dangerous .  Linton had been listening to this conversation in silence . He had come to the senior day-room to borrow a book . He now slipped out , and made his way to Drummonds study .  Drummond was in . Linton proceeded to business .  I say , Drummond .  Hullo ?  That man Stanning has come in . Hes getting the senior day-room to rag Sheens study .  What!  Linton repeated his statement .  Does the man think he owns the house ? said Drummond . Where is he ?  Coming up now . I hear them . What are you going to do ? Stop them ?  What do you think ? Of course I am . Im not going to have any of Applebys crew coming into Seymours and ragging studies .  This ought to be worth seeing , said Linton . Look on me as Charles , his friend . Ill help if you want me , but its your scene .  Drummond opened his door just as Stanning and his myrmidons were passing it .  Hullo , Stanning , he said .  Stanning turned . The punitive expedition stopped .  Do you want anything ? inquired Drummond politely .  The members of the senior day-room who were with Stanning rallied round , silent and interested . This dramatic situation appealed to them . They had a passion for rows , and this looked distinctly promising .  There was a pause . Stanning looked carefully at Drummond . Drummond looked carefully at Stanning .  I was going to see Sheen , said Stanning at length .  He isnt in .  Oh!  Another pause .  Was it anything special ? inquired Drummond pleasantly .  The expedition edged a little forward .  No . Oh , no . Nothing special , said Stanning .  The expedition looked disappointed .  Any message I can give him ? asked Drummond .  No , thanks , said Stanning .  Sure ?  Quite , thanks .  I dont think its worth while your waiting . He may not be in for some time .  No , perhaps not . Thanks . So long .  So long .  Stanning turned on his heel , and walked away down the passage . Drummond went back into his study , and shut the door .  The expedition , deprived of its commander-in-chief , paused irresolutely outside . Then it followed its leaders example .  There was peace in the passage .     XV  THE ROUT AT RIPTON   On the Saturday following this episode , the first fifteen travelled to Ripton to play the return match with that school on its own ground . Of the two Ripton matches , the one played at Wrykyn was always the big event of the football year; but the other came next in importance , and the telegram which was despatched to the school shop at the close of the game was always awaited with anxiety . This year Wrykyn looked forward to the return match with a certain amount of apathy , due partly to the fact that the school was in a slack , unpatriotic state , and partly to the hammering the team had received in the previous term , when the Ripton centre three-quarters had run through and scored with monotonous regularity . Were bound to get sat on , was the general verdict of the school .  Allardyce , while thoroughly agreeing with this opinion , did his best to conceal the fact from the rest of the team . He had certainly done his duty by them . Every day for the past fortnight the forwards and outsides had turned out to run and pass , and on the Saturdays there had been matches with Corpus , Oxford , and the Cambridge Old Wrykinians . In both games the school had been beaten . In fact , it seemed as if they could only perform really well when they had no opponents . To see the three-quarters racing down the field (at practice) and scoring innumerable (imaginary) tries , one was apt to be misled into considering them a fine quartette . But when there was a match , all the beautiful dash and precision of the passing faded away , and the last thing they did was to run straight . Barry was the only one of the four who played the game properly .  But , as regarded condition , there was nothing wrong with the team . Even Trevor could not have made them train harder; and Allardyce in his more sanguine moments had a shadowy hope that the Ripton score might , with care , be kept in the teens .  Barry had bought a Sportsman at the station , and he unfolded it as the train began to move . Searching the left-hand column of the middle page , as we all do when we buy the Sportsman on Saturday--to see how our names look in print , and what sort of a team the enemy has got--he made a remarkable discovery . At the same moment Drummond , on the other side of the carriage , did the same .  I say , he said , they must have had a big clear-out at Ripton . Have you seen the team theyve got out today ?  I was just looking at it , said Barry .  Whats up with it ? inquired Allardyce . Lets have a look .  Theyve only got about half their proper team . Theyve got a different back--Grey isnt playing .  Both their centres are , though , said Drummond .  More fun for us , Drum . , old chap , said Attell . Im going home again . Stop the train .  Drummond said nothing . He hated Attell most when he tried to be facetious .  Dunn isnt playing , nor is Waite , said Barry , so they havent got either of their proper halves . I say , we might have a chance of doing something today .  Of course we shall , said Allardyce . Youve only got to buck up and weve got them on toast .  The atmosphere in the carriage became charged with optimism . It seemed a simple thing to defeat a side which was practically a Ripton A team . The centre three-quarters were there still , it was true , but Allardyce and Drummond ought to be able to prevent the halves ever getting the ball out to them . The team looked on those two unknown halves as timid novices , who would lose their heads at the kick-off . As a matter of fact , the system of football teaching at Ripton was so perfect , and the keenness so great , that the second fifteen was nearly as good as the first every year . But the Wrykyn team did not know this , with the exception of Allardyce , who kept his knowledge to himself; and they arrived at Ripton jaunty and confident .  Keith , the Ripton captain , who was one of the centre three-quarters who had made so many holes in the Wrykyn defence in the previous term , met the team at the station , and walked up to the school with them , carrying Allardyces bag .  You seem to have lost a good many men at Christmas , said Allardyce . We were reading the Sportsman in the train . Apparently , youve only got ten of your last terms lot . Have they all left ?  The Ripton captain grinned ruefully .  Not much , he replied . Theyre all here . All except Dunn . You remember Dunn ? Little thick-set chap who played half . He always had his hair quite tidy and parted exactly in the middle all through the game .  Oh , yes , I remember Dunn . Whats he doing now ?  Gone to Coopers Hill . Rot , his not going to the Varsity . Hed have walked into his blue .  Allardyce agreed . He had marked Dunn in the match of the previous term , and that immaculate sportsman had made things not a little warm for him .  Where are all the others , then ? he asked . Wheres that other half of yours ? And the rest of the forwards ?  Mumps , said Keith .  What!  Its a fact . Rot , isnt it ? Weve had a regular bout of it . Twenty fellows got it altogether . Naturally , four of those were in the team . Thats the way things happen . I only wonder the whole scrum didnt have it .  What beastly luck , said Allardyce . We had measles like that a couple of years ago in the summer term , and had to play the Incogs and Zingari with a sort of second eleven . We got mopped .  Thats what we shall get this afternoon , Im afraid , said Keith .  Oh , no , said Allardyce . Of course you wont .  And , as events turned out , that was one of the truest remarks he had ever made in his life .         *       *       *       *       *  One of the drawbacks to playing Ripton on its own ground was the crowd . Another was the fact that one generally got beaten . But your sportsman can put up with defeat . What he does not like is a crowd that regards him as a subtle blend of incompetent idiot and malicious scoundrel , and says so very loud and clear . It was not , of course , the school that did this . They spent their time blushing for the shouters . It was the patriotic inhabitants of Ripton town who made the school wish that they could be saved from their friends . The football ground at Ripton was at the edge of the school fields , separated from the road by narrow iron railings; and along these railings the choicest spirits of the town would line up , and smoke and yell , and spit and yell again . As Wordsworth wrote , There are two voices . They were on something like the following lines .  Inside the railings: Sch-oo-oo-oo-oo-l! Buck up Sch-oo-oo-oo-oo-l!! Get it OUT , Schoo-oo-oo-oo-l!!!  Outside the railings: Gow it , Ripton! Thats the way , Ripton! Twist his good-old-English-adjectived neck , Ripton! Sit on his forcibly described head , Ripton! Gow it , Ripton! Haw , Haw , Haw! They aint no use , RIPton! Kick im in the eye , RipTON! Haw , Haw , Haw!  The bursts of merriment signalised the violent downfall of some dangerous opponent .  The school loathed these humble supporters , and occasionally fastidious juniors would go the length of throwing chunks of mud at them through the railings . But nothing discouraged them or abated their fervid desire to see the school win . Every year they seemed to increase in zeal , and they were always in great form at the Wrykyn match .  It would be charitable to ascribe to this reason the gruesome happenings of that afternoon . They needed some explaining away .         *       *       *       *       *  Allardyce won the toss , and chose to start downhill , with the wind in his favour . It is always best to get these advantages at the beginning of the game . If one starts against the wind , it usually changes ends at half-time . Amidst a roar from both touch-lines and a volley of howls from the road , a Ripton forward kicked off . The ball flew in the direction of Stanning , on the right wing . A storm of laughter arose from the road as he dropped it . The first scrum was formed on the Wrykyn twenty-five line .  The Ripton forwards got the ball , and heeled with their usual neatness . The Ripton half who was taking the scrum gathered it cleanly , and passed to his colleague . He was a sturdy youth with a dark , rather forbidding face , in which the acute observer might have read signs of the savage . He was of the breed which is vaguely described at public schools as nigger , a term covering every variety of shade from ebony to light lemon . As a matter of fact he was a half-caste , sent home to England to be educated . Drummond recognised him as he dived forward to tackle him . The last place where they had met had been the roped ring at Aldershot . It was his opponent in the final of the Feathers .  He reached him as he swerved , and they fell together . The ball bounded forward .  Hullo , Peteiro , he said . Thought youd left .  The other grinned recognition .  Hullo , Drummond .  Going up to Aldershot this year ?  Yes . Light-Weight .  So am I .  The scrum had formed by now , and further conversation was impossible . Drummond looked a little thoughtful as he put the ball in . He had been told that Peteiro was leaving Ripton at Christmas . It was a nuisance his being still at school . Drummond was not afraid of him--he would have fought a champion of the world if the school had expected him to--but he could not help remembering that it was only by the very narrowest margin , and after a terrific three rounds , that he had beaten him in the Feathers the year before . It would be too awful for words if the decision were to be reversed in the coming competition .  But he was not allowed much leisure for pondering on the future . The present was too full of incident and excitement . The withdrawal of the four invalids and the departure of Dunn had not reduced the Ripton team to that wreck of its former self which the Wrykyn fifteen had looked for . On the contrary , their play seemed , if anything , a shade better than it had been in the former match . There was all the old aggressiveness , and Peteiro and his partner , so far from being timid novices and losing their heads , eclipsed the exhibition given at Wrykyn by Waite and Dunn . Play had only been in progress six minutes when Keith , taking a pass on the twenty-five line , slipped past Attell , ran round the back , and scored between the posts . Three minutes later the other Ripton centre scored . At the end of twenty minutes the Wrykyn line had been crossed five times , and each of the tries had been converted .  Cant you fellows get that ball in the scrum ? demanded Allardyce plaintively , as the team began for the fifth time the old familiar walk to the half-way line . Pack tight , and get the first shove .  The result of this address was to increase the Ripton lead by four points . In his anxiety to get the ball , one of the Wrykyn forwards started heeling before it was in , and the referee promptly gave a free kick to Ripton for foot up . As this event took place within easy reach of the Wrykyn goal , and immediately in front of the same , Keith had no difficulty in bringing off the penalty .  By half-time the crowd in the road , hoarse with laughter , had exhausted all their adjectives and were repeating themselves . The Ripton score was six goals , a penalty goal , and two tries to nil , and the Wrykyn team was a demoralised rabble .  The fact that the rate of scoring slackened somewhat after the interval may be attributed to the disinclination of the Riptonians to exert themselves unduly . They ceased playing in the stern and scientific spirit in which they had started; and , instead of adhering to an orthodox game , began to enjoy themselves . The forwards no longer heeled like a machine . They broke through ambitiously , and tried to score on their own account . When the outsides got as far as the back , they did not pass . They tried to drop goals . In this way only twenty-two points were scored after half-time . Allardyce and Drummond battled on nobly , but with their pack hopelessly outclassed it was impossible for them to do anything of material use . Barry , on the wing , tackled his man whenever the latter got the ball , but , as a rule , the centres did not pass , but attacked by themselves . At last , by way of a fitting conclusion to the rout , the Ripton back , catching a high punt , ran instead of kicking , and , to the huge delight of the town contingent , scored . With this incident the visiting team drained the last dregs of the bitter cup . Humiliation could go no further . Almost immediately afterwards the referee blew his whistle for No side .  Three cheers for Wrykyn , said Keith .  To the fifteen victims it sounded ironical .     XVI  DRUMMOND GOES INTO RETIREMENT   The return journey of a school team after a crushing defeat in a foreign match is never a very exhilarating business . Those members of the side who have not yet received their colours are wondering which of them is to be sacrificed to popular indignation and chucked: the rest , who have managed to get their caps , are feeling that even now two-thirds of the school will be saying that they are not worth a place in the third fifteen; while the captain , brooding apart , is becoming soured at the thought that Posterity will forget what little good he may have done , and remember only that it was in his year that the school got so many points taken off them by So-and-So . Conversation does not ripple and sparkle during these home-comings . The Wrykyn team made the journey in almost unbroken silence . They were all stiff and sore , and their feelings were such as to unfit them for talking to people .  The school took the thing very philosophically--a bad sign . When a school is in a healthy , normal condition , it should be stirred up by a bad defeat by another school , like a disturbed wasps nest . Wrykyn made one or two remarks about people who could not play footer for toffee , and then let the thing drop .  Sheen was too busy with his work and his boxing to have much leisure for mourning over this latest example of the present inefficiency of the school . The examination for the Gotford was to come off in two days , and the inter-house boxing was fixed for the following Wednesday . In five days , therefore , he would get his chance of retrieving his lost place in the school . He was certain that he could , at any rate make a very good show against anyone in the school , even Drummond . Joe Bevan was delighted with his progress , and quoted Shakespeare volubly in his admiration . Jack Bruce and Francis added their tribute , and the knife and boot boy paid him the neatest compliment of all by refusing point-blank to have any more dealings with him whatsoever . His professional duties , explained the knife and boot boy , did not include being punched in the heye by blokes , and he did not intend to be put upon .  Youll do all right , said Jack Bruce , as they were motoring home , if theyll let you go in for it all . But how do you know they will ? Have they chosen the men yet ?  Not yet . They dont do it till the day before . But there wont be any difficulty about that . Drummond will let me have a shot if he thinks Im good enough .  Oh , youre good enough , said Bruce .  And when , on Monday evening , Francis , on receipt of no fewer than four blows in a single round--a record , shook him by the hand and said that if ever he happened to want a leetle darg that was a perfect bag of tricks and had got a pedigree , mind you , he , Francis , would be proud to supply that animal , Sheen felt that the moment had come to approach Drummond on the subject of the house boxing . It would be a little awkward at first , and conversation would probably run somewhat stiffly; but all would be well once he had explained himself .  But things had been happening in his absence which complicated the situation . Allardyce was having tea with Drummond , who had been stopping in with a sore throat . He had come principally to make arrangements for the match between his house and Seymours in the semi-final round of the competition .  Youre looking bad , he said , taking a seat .  Im feeling bad , said Drummond . For the past few days he had been very much out of sorts . He put it down to a chill caught after the Ripton match . He had never mustered up sufficient courage to sponge himself with cold water after soaking in a hot bath , and he occasionally suffered for it .  Whats up ? inquired Allardyce .  Oh , I dont know . Sort of beastly feeling . Sore throat . Nothing much . Only it makes you feel rather rotten .  Allardyce looked interested .  I say , he said , it looks as if--I wonder . I hope you havent .  What ?  Mumps . It sounds jolly like it .  Mumps! Of course Ive not . Why should I ?  Allardyce produced a letter from his pocket . I got this from Keith , the Ripton captain , this morning . You know theyve had a lot of the thing there . Oh , didnt you ? That was why they had such a bad team out .  Bad team! murmured Drummond .  Well , I mean not their best team . They had four of their men down with mumps . Heres what Keith says . Listen . Bit about hoping we got back all right , and so on , first . Then he says--here it is , Another of our fellows has got the mumps . One of the forwards; rather a long man who was good out of touch . He developed it a couple of days after the match . Its lucky that all our card games are over . We beat Johns , Oxford , last Wednesday , and that finished the card . But itll rather rot up the House matches . We should have walked the cup , but theres no knowing what will happen now . I hope none of your lot caught the mumps from Browning during the game . Its quite likely , of course . Browning ought not to have been playing , but I had no notion that there was anything wrong with him . He never said he felt bad . Youve got it , Drummond . Thats whats the matter with you .  Oh , rot , said Drummond . Its only a chill .  But the school doctor , who had looked in at the house to dose a small Seymourite who had indulged too heartily in the pleasures of the table , had other views , and before lock-up Drummond was hurried off to the infirmary .  Sheen went to Drummonds study after preparation had begun , and was surprised to find him out . Not being on speaking terms with a single member of the house , he was always out-of-date as regarded items of school news . As a rule he had to wait until Jack Bruce told him before learning of any occurrence of interest . He had no notion that mumps was the cause of Drummonds absence , and he sat and waited patiently for him in his study till the bell rang for prayers . The only possible explanation that occurred to him was that Drummond was in somebody elses study , and he could not put his theory to the test by going and looking . It was only when Drummond did not put in an appearance at prayers that Sheen began to suspect that something might have happened .  It was maddening not to be able to make inquiries . He had almost decided to go and ask Linton , and risk whatever might be the consequences of such a step , when he remembered that the matron must know . He went to her , and was told that Drummond was in the infirmary .  He could not help seeing that this made his position a great deal more difficult . In ten minutes he could have explained matters to Drummond if he had found him in his study . But it would be a more difficult task to put the thing clearly in a letter .  Meanwhile , it was bed-time , and he soon found his hands too full with his dormitory to enable him to think out the phrasing of that letter . The dormitory , which was recruited entirely from the junior day-room , had heard of Drummonds departure with rejoicings . They liked Drummond , but he was a good deal too fond of the iron hand for their tastes . A night with Sheen in charge should prove a welcome change .  A deafening uproar was going on when Sheen arrived , and as he came into the room somebody turned the gas out . He found some matches on the chest of drawers , and lit it again just in time to see a sportive youth tearing the clothes off his bed and piling them on the floor . A month before he would not have known how to grapple with such a situation , but his evenings with Joe Bevan had given him the habit of making up his mind and acting rapidly . Drummond was wont to keep a swagger-stick by his bedside for the better observance of law and order . Sheen possessed himself of this swagger-stick , and reasoned with the sportive youth . The rest of the dormitory looked on in interested silence . It was a critical moment , and on his handling of it depended Sheens victory or defeat . If he did not keep his head he was lost . A dormitory is merciless to a prefect whose weakness they have discovered .  Sheen kept his head . In a quiet , pleasant voice , fingering the swagger-stick , as he spoke , in an absent manner , he requested his young friend to re-make the bed--rapidly and completely . For the space of five minutes no sound broke the silence except the rustle of sheets and blankets . At the end of that period the bed looked as good as new .  Thanks , said Sheen gratefully . Thats very kind of you .  He turned to the rest of the dormitory .  Dont let me detain you , he said politely . Get into bed as soon as you like .  The dormitory got into bed sooner than they liked . For some reason the colossal rag they had planned had fizzled out . They were thoughtful as they crept between the sheets . Could these things be ?         *       *       *       *       *  After much deliberation Sheen sent his letter to Drummond on the following day . It was not a long letter , but it was carefully worded . It explained that he had taken up boxing of late , and ended with a request that he might be allowed to act as Drummonds understudy in the House competitions .  It was late that evening when the infirmary attendant came over with the answer .  Like the original letter , the answer was brief .  Dear Sheen , wrote Drummond , thanks for the offer . I am afraid I cant accept it . We must have the best man . Linton is going to box for the House in the Light-Weights .     XVII  SEYMOURS ONE SUCCESS   This polite epistle , it may be mentioned , was a revised version of the one which Drummond originally wrote in reply to Sheens request . His first impulse had been to answer in the four brief words , Dont be a fool; for Sheens letter had struck him as nothing more than a contemptible piece of posing , and he had all the hatred for poses which is a characteristic of the plain and straightforward type of mind . It seemed to him that Sheen , as he expressed it to himself , was trying to do the boy hero . In the school library , which had been stocked during the dark ages , when that type of story was popular , there were numerous school stories in which the hero retrieved a rocky reputation by thrashing the bully , displaying in the encounter an intuitive but overwhelming skill with his fists . Drummond could not help feeling that Sheen must have been reading one of these stories . It was all very fine and noble of him to want to show that he was No Coward After All , like Leo Cholmondeley or whatever his beastly name was , in The Lads of St . Ethelbertas or some such piffling book; but , thought Drummond in his cold , practical way , what about the house ? If Sheen thought that Seymours was going to chuck away all chance of winning one of the inter-house events , simply in order to give him an opportunity of doing the Young Hero , the sooner he got rid of that sort of idea , the better . If he wanted to do the Leo Cholmondeley business , let him go and chuck a kid into the river , and jump in and save him . But he wasnt going to have the house let in for twenty Sheens .  Such were the meditations of Drummond when the infirmary attendant brought Sheens letter to him; and he seized pencil and paper and wrote , Dont be a fool . But pity succeeded contempt , and he tore up the writing . After all , however much he had deserved it , the man had had a bad time . It was no use jumping on him . And at one time they had been pals . Might as well do the thing politely .  All of which reflections would have been prevented had Sheen thought of mentioning the simple fact that it was Joe Bevan who had given him the lessons to which he referred in his letter . But he had decided not to do so , wishing to avoid long explanations . And there was , he felt , a chance that the letter might come into other hands than those of Drummond . So he had preserved silence on that point , thereby wrecking his entire scheme .  It struck him that he might go to Linton , explain his position , and ask him to withdraw in his favour , but there were difficulties in the way of that course . There is a great deal of red tape about the athletic arrangements of a house at a public school . When once an order has gone forth , it is difficult to get it repealed . Linton had been chosen to represent the house in the Light-Weights , and he would carry out orders . Only illness would prevent him appearing in the ring .  Sheen made up his mind not to try to take his place , and went through the days a victim to gloom , which was caused by other things besides his disappointment respecting the boxing competition . The Gotford examination was over now , and he was not satisfied with his performance . Though he did not know it , his dissatisfaction was due principally to the fact that , owing to his isolation , he had been unable to compare notes after the examinations with the others . Doing an examination without comparing notes subsequently with ones rivals , is like playing golf against a bogey . The imaginary rival against whom one pits oneself never makes a mistake . Our own howlers stand out in all their horrid nakedness; but we do not realise that our rivals have probably made others far worse . In this way Sheen plumbed the depths of depression . The Gotford was a purely Classical examination , with the exception of one paper , a General Knowledge paper; and it was in this that Sheen fancied he had failed so miserably . His Greek and Latin verse were always good; his prose , he felt , was not altogether beyond the pale; but in the General Knowledge paper he had come down heavily . As a matter of fact , if he had only known , the paper was an exceptionally hard one , and there was not a single candidate for the scholarship who felt satisfied with his treatment of it . It was to questions ten , eleven , and thirteen of this paper that Cardew , of the School House , who had entered for the scholarship for the sole reason that competitors got excused two clear days of ordinary school-work , wrote the following answer:      See Encylopaedia Britannica , Times edition .  If they really wanted to know , he said subsequently , that was the authority to go to . He himself would probably misinform them altogether .  In addition to the Gotford and the House Boxing , the House Fives now came on , and the authorities of Seymours were in no small perplexity . They met together in Rigbys study to discuss the matter . Their difficulty was this . There was only one inmate of Seymours who had a chance of carrying off the House Fives Cup . And that was Sheen . The house was asking itself what was to be done about it .  You see , said Rigby , you can look at it in two ways , whichever you like . We ought certainly to send in our best man for the pot , whatever sort of chap he is . But then , come to think of it , Sheen cant very well be said to belong to the house at all . When a mans been cut dead during the whole term , he cant be looked on as one of the house very well . See what I mean ?  Of course he cant , said Mill , who was second in command at Seymours . Mills attitude towards his fellow men was one of incessant hostility . He seemed to bear a grudge against the entire race .  Rigby resumed . He was a pacific person , and hated anything resembling rows in the house . He had been sorry for Sheen , and would have been glad to give him a chance of setting himself on his legs again .  You see , he said , this is what I mean . We either recognise Sheens existence or we dont . Follow ? We cant get him to win this Cup for us , and then , when he has done it , go on cutting him and treating him as if he didnt belong to the house at all . I know he let the house down awfully badly in that business , but still , if he lifts the Fives Cup , thatll square the thing . If he does anything to give the house a leg-up , he must be treated as if hed never let it down at all .  Of course , said Barry . I vote we send him in for the Fives .  What rot! said Mill . It isnt as if none of the rest of us played fives .  We arent as good as Sheen , said Barry .  I dont care . I call it rot letting a chap like him represent the house at anything . If he were the best fives-player in the world I wouldnt let him play for the house .  Rigby was impressed by his vehemence . He hesitated .  After all , Barry , he said , I dont know . Perhaps it might--you see , he did--well , I really think wed better have somebody else . The house has got its knife into Sheen too much just at present to want him as a representative . Thered only be sickness , dont you think ? Who else is there ?  So it came about that Menzies was chosen to uphold the house in the Fives Courts . Sheen was not surprised . But it was not pleasant . He was certainly having bad luck in his attempts to do something for the house . Perhaps if he won the Gotford they might show a little enthusiasm . The Gotford always caused a good deal of interest in the school . It was the best thing of its kind in existence at Wrykyn , and even the most abandoned loafers liked to feel that their house had won it . It was just possible , thought Sheen , that a brilliant win might change the feelings of Seymours towards him . He did not care for the applause of the multitude more than a boy should , but he preferred it very decidedly to the cut direct .  Things went badly for Seymours . Never in the history of the house , or , at any rate , in the comparatively recent history of the house , had there been such a slump in athletic trophies . To begin with , they were soundly beaten in the semi-final for the House football cup by Allardyces lot . With Drummond away , there was none to mark the captain of the School team at half , and Allardyce had raced through in a manner that must have compensated him to a certain extent for the poor time he had had in first fifteen matches . The game had ended in a Seymourite defeat by nineteen points to five .  Nor had the Boxing left the house in a better position . Linton fought pluckily in the Light-Weights , but went down before Stanning , after beating a representative of Templars . Mill did not show up well in the Heavy-Weights , and was defeated in his first bout . Seymours were reduced to telling themselves how different it all would have been if Drummond had been there .  Sheen watched the Light-Weight contests , and nearly danced with irritation . He felt that he could have eaten Stanning . The man was quick with his left , but he couldnt box . He hadnt a notion of side-stepping , and the upper-cut appeared to be entirely outside his range . He would like to see him tackle Francis .  Sheen thought bitterly of Drummond . Why on earth couldnt he have given him a chance . It was maddening .  The Fives carried on the story . Menzies was swamped by a Days man . He might just as well have stayed away altogether . The star of Seymours was very low on the horizon .  And then the house scored its one success . The headmaster announced it in the Hall after prayers in his dry , unemotional way .  I have received the list of marks , he said , from the examiners for the Gotford Scholarship . He paused . Sheen felt a sudden calm triumph flood over him . Somehow , intuitively , he knew that he had won . He waited without excitement for the next words .  Out of a possible thousand marks , Sheen , who wins the scholarship , obtained seven hundred and one , Stanning six hundred and four , Wilson . . . .  Sheen walked out of the Hall in the unique position of a Gotford winner with only one friend to congratulate him . Jack Bruce was the one . The other six hundred and thirty-three members of the school made no demonstration .  There was a pleasant custom at Seymours of applauding at tea any Seymourite who had won distinction , and so shed a reflected glory on the house . The head of the house would observe , Well played , So-and-So! and the rest of the house would express their emotion in the way that seemed best to them , to the subsequent exultation of the local crockery merchant , who had generally to supply at least a dozen fresh cups and plates to the house after one of these occasions . When it was for getting his first eleven or first fifteen cap that the lucky man was being cheered , the total of breakages sometimes ran into the twenties .  Rigby , good , easy man , was a little doubtful as to what course to pursue in the circumstances . Should he give the signal ? After all , the fellow had won the Gotford . It was a score for the house , and they wanted all the scores they could get in these lean years . Perhaps , then , he had better .  Well played , Sheen , said he .  There was a dead silence . A giggle from the fags table showed that the comedy of the situation was not lost on the young mind .  The head of the house looked troubled . This was awfully awkward .  Well played , Sheen , he said again .  Dont mention it , Rigby , said the winner of the Gotford politely , looking up from his plate .     XVIII  MR BEVAN MAKES A SUGGESTION   When one has been working hard with a single end in view , the arrival and departure of the supreme moment is apt to leave a feeling of emptiness , as if life had been drained of all its interest , and left nothing sufficiently exciting to make it worth doing . Horatius , as he followed his plough on a warm day over the corn land which his gratified country bestowed on him for his masterly handling of the traffic on the bridge , must sometimes have felt it was a little tame . The feeling is far more acute when one has been unexpectedly baulked in ones desire for action . Sheen , for the first few days after he received Drummonds brief note , felt that it was useless for him to try to do anything . The Fates were against him . In stories , as Mr Anstey has pointed out , the hero is never long without his chance of retrieving his reputation . A mad bull comes into the school grounds , and he alone (the hero , not the bull) is calm . Or there is a fire , and whose is that pale and gesticulating form at the upper window ? The bullys , of course . And who is that climbing nimbly up the Virginia creeper ? Why , the hero . Who else ? Three hearty cheers for the plucky hero .  But in real life opportunities of distinguishing oneself are less frequent .  Sheen continued his visits to the Blue Boar , but more because he shrank from telling Joe Bevan that all his trouble had been for nothing , than because he had any definite object in view . It was bitter to listen to the eulogies of the pugilist , when all the while he knew that , as far as any immediate results were concerned , it did not really matter whether he boxed well or feebly . Some day , perhaps , as Mr Bevan was fond of pointing out when he approached the subject of disadvantages of boxing , he might meet a hooligan when he was crossing a field with his sister; but he found that but small consolation . He was in the position of one who wants a small sum of ready money , and is told that , in a few years , he may come into a fortune . By the time he got a chance of proving himself a man with his hands , he would be an Old Wrykinian . He was leaving at the end of the summer term .  Jack Bruce was sympathetic , and talked more freely than was his wont .  I cant understand it , he said . Drummond always seemed a good sort . I should have thought he would have sent you in for the house like a shot . Are you sure you put it plainly in your letter ? What did you say ?  Sheen repeated the main points of his letter .  Did you tell him who had been teaching you ?  No . I just said Id been boxing lately .  Pity , said Jack Bruce . If youd mentioned that it was Joe whod been training you , he would probably have been much more for it . You see , he couldnt know whether you were any good or not from your letter . But if youd told him that Joe Bevan and Hunt both thought you good , hed have seen there was something in it .  It never occurred to me . Like a fool , I was counting on the thing so much that it didnt strike me there would be any real difficulty in getting him to see my point . Especially when he got mumps and couldnt go in himself . Well , it cant be helped now .  And the conversation turned to the prospects of Jack Bruces father in the forthcoming election , the polling for which had just begun .  Im busy now , said Bruce . Im not sure that I shall be able to do much sparring with you for a bit .  My dear chap , dont let me--  Oh , its all right , really . Taking you to the Blue Boar doesnt land me out of my way at all . Most of the work lies round in this direction . I call at cottages , and lug oldest inhabitants to the poll . Its rare sport .  Does your pater know ?  Oh , yes . He rots me about it like anything , but , all the same , I believe hes really rather bucked because Ive roped in quite a dozen voters who wouldnt have stirred a yard if I hadnt turned up . Thats where were scoring . Pedder hasnt got a car yet , and these old rotters round here arent going to move out of their chairs to go for a ride in an ordinary cart . But they chuck away their crutches and hop into a motor like one oclock .  It must be rather a rag , said Sheen .  The car drew up at the door of the Blue Boar . Sheen got out and ran upstairs to the gymnasium . Joe Bevan was sparring a round with Francis . He watched them while he changed , but without the enthusiasm of which he had been conscious on previous occasions . The solid cleverness of Joe Bevan , and the quickness and cunning of the bantam-weight , were as much in evidence as before , but somehow the glamour and romance which had surrounded them were gone . He no longer watched eagerly to pick up the slightest hint from these experts . He felt no more interest than he would have felt in watching a game of lawn tennis . He had been keen . Since his disappointment with regard to the House Boxing he had become indifferent .  Joe Bevan noticed this before he had been boxing with him a minute .  Hullo , sir , he said , whats this ? Tired today ? Not feeling well ? You arent boxing like yourself , not at all you arent . Theres no weight behind em . Youre tapping . Whats the matter with your feet , too ? You arent getting about as quickly as I should like to see . What have you been doing to yourself ?  Nothing that I know of , said Sheen . Im sorry Im so rotten . Lets have another try .  The second try proved as unsatisfactory as the first . He was listless , and his leads and counters lacked conviction .  Joe Bevan , who identified himself with his pupils with that thoroughness which is the hall-mark of the first-class boxing instructor , looked so pained at his sudden loss of form , that Sheen could not resist the temptation to confide in him . After all , he must tell him some time .  The fact is , he said , as they sat on the balcony overlooking the river , waiting for Jack Bruce to return with his car , Ive had a bit of a sickener .  I thought youd got sick of it , said Mr Bevan . Well , have a bit of a rest .  I dont mean that Im tired of boxing , Sheen hastened to explain . After all the trouble youve taken with me , it would be a bit thick if I chucked it just as I was beginning to get on . It isnt that . But you know how keen I was on boxing for the house ?  Joe Bevan nodded .  Did you get beat ?  They wouldnt let me go in , said Sheen .  But , bless me! youd have made babies of them . What was the instructor doing ? Couldnt he see that you were good ?  I didnt get a chance of showing what I could do . He explained the difficulties of the situation .  Mr Bevan nodded his head thoughtfully .  So naturally , concluded Sheen , the thing has put me out a bit . Its beastly having nothing to work for . Im at a loose end . Up till now , Ive always had the thought of the House Competition to keep me going . But now--well , you see how it is . Its like running to catch a train , and then finding suddenly that youve got plenty of time . There doesnt seem any point in going on running .  Why not Aldershot , sir ? said Mr Bevan .  What! cried Sheen .  The absolute novelty of the idea , and the gorgeous possibilities of it , made him tingle from head to foot . Aldershot! Why hadnt he thought of it before! The House Competition suddenly lost its importance in his eyes . It was a trivial affair , after all , compared with Aldershot , that Mecca of the public-school boxer .  Then the glow began to fade . Doubts crept in . He might have learned a good deal from Joe Bevan , but had he learned enough to be able to hold his own with the best boxers of all the public schools in the country ? And if he had the skill to win , had he the heart ? Joe Bevan had said that he would not disgrace himself again , and he felt that the chances were against his doing so , but there was the terrible possibility . He had stood up to Francis and the others , and he had taken their blows without flinching; but in these encounters there was always at the back of his mind the comforting feeling that there was a limit to the amount of punishment he would receive . If Francis happened to drive him into a corner where he could neither attack , nor defend himself against attack , he did not use his advantage to the full . He indicated rather than used it . A couple of blows , and he moved out into the open again . But in the Public Schools Competition at Aldershot there would be no quarter . There would be nothing but deadly earnest . If he allowed himself to be manoeuvred into an awkward position , only his own skill , or the call of time , could extricate him from it .  In a word , at the Blue Boar he sparred . At Aldershot he would have to fight . Was he capable of fighting ?  Then there was another difficulty . How was he to get himself appointed as the Wrykyn light-weight representative ? Now that Drummond was unable to box , Stanning would go down , as the winner of the School Competition . These things were worked by an automatic process . Sheen felt that he could beat Stanning , but he had no means of publishing this fact to the school . He could not challenge him to a trial of skill . That sort of thing was not done .  He explained this to Joe Bevan .  Well , its a pity , said Joe regretfully . Its a pity .  At this moment Jack Bruce appeared .  Whats a pity , Joe ? he asked .  Joe wants me to go to Aldershot as a light-weight , explained Sheen , and I was just saying that I couldnt , because of Stanning .  What about Stanning ?  He won the School Competition , you see , so theyre bound to send him down .  Half a minute , said Jack Bruce . I never thought of Aldershot for you before . Its a jolly good idea . I believe youd have a chance . And its all right about Stanning . Hes not going down . Havent you heard ?  I dont hear anything . Why isnt he going down ?  Hes knocked up one of his wrists . So he says .  How do you mean--so he says ? asked Sheen .  I believe he funks it .  Why ? What makes you think that ?  Oh , I dont know . Its only my opinion . Still , its a little queer . Stanning says he crocked his left wrist in the final of the House Competition .  Well , whats wrong with that ? Why shouldnt he have done so ?  Sheen objected strongly to Stanning , but he had the elements of justice in him , and he was not going to condemn him on insufficient evidence , particularly of a crime of which he himself had been guilty .  Of course he may have done , said Bruce . But its a bit fishy that he should have been playing fives all right two days running just after the competition .  He might have crocked himself then .  Then why didnt he say so ?  A question which Sheen found himself unable to answer .  Then theres nothing to prevent you fighting , sir , said Joe Bevan , who had been listening attentively to the conversation .  Do you really think Ive got a chance ?  I do , sir .  Of course you have , said Jack Bruce . Youre quite as good as Drummond was , last time I saw him box .  Then Ill have a shot at it , said Sheen .  Good for you , sir , cried Joe Bevan .  Though itll be a bit of a job getting leave , said Sheen . How would you start about it , Bruce ?  Youd better ask Spence . Hes the man to go to .  Thats all right . Im rather a pal of Spences .  Ask him tonight after prep . , suggested Bruce .  And then you can come here regular , said Joe Bevan , and well train you till youre that fit you could eat bricks , and youll make babies of them up at Aldershot .     XIX  PAVING THE WAY   Bruce had been perfectly correct in his suspicions . Stannings wrist was no more sprained than his ankle . The advisability of manufacturing an injury had come home to him very vividly on the Saturday morning following the Ripton match , when he had read the brief report of that painful episode in that weeks number of the Field in the school library . In the list of the Ripton team appeared the name R . Peteiro . He had heard a great deal about the dusky Riptonian when Drummond had beaten him in the Feather-Weights the year before . Drummond had returned from Aldershot on that occasion cheerful , but in an extremely battered condition . His appearance as he limped about the field on Sports Day had been heroic , and , in addition , a fine advertisement for the punishing powers of the Ripton champion . It is true that at least one of his injuries had been the work of a Pauline whom he had met in the opening bout; but the great majority were presents from Ripton , and Drummond had described the dusky one , in no uncertain terms , as a holy terror .  These things had sunk into Stannings mind . It had been generally understood at Wrykyn that Peteiro had left school at Christmas . When Stanning , through his study of the Field , discovered that the redoubtable boxer had been one of the team against which he had played at Ripton , and realised that , owing to Drummonds illness , it would fall to him , if he won the House Competition , to meet this man of wrath at Aldershot , he resolved on the instant that the most persuasive of wild horses should not draw him to that military centre on the day of the Public Schools Competition . The difficulty was that he particularly wished to win the House Cup . Then it occurred to him that he could combine the two things--win the competition and get injured while doing so .  Accordingly , two days after the House Boxing he was observed to issue from Applebys with his left arm slung in a first fifteen scarf . He was too astute to injure his right wrist . What happens to ones left wrist at school is ones own private business . When one injures ones right arm , and so incapacitates oneself for form work , the authorities begin to make awkward investigations .  Mr Spence , who looked after the schools efforts to win medals at Aldershot , was the most disappointed person in the place . He was an enthusiastic boxer--he had represented Cambridge in the Middle-Weights in his day--and with no small trouble had succeeded in making boxing a going concern at Wrykyn . Years of failure had ended , the Easter before , in a huge triumph , when OHara , of Dexters and Drummond had won silver medals , and Moriarty , of Dexters , a bronze . If only somebody could win a medal this year , the tradition would be established , and would not soon die out . Unfortunately , there was not a great deal of boxing talent in the school just now . The rule that the winner at his weight in the House Competitions should represent the school at Aldershot only applied if the winner were fairly proficient . Mr Spence exercised his discretion . It was no use sending down novices to be massacred . This year Drummond and Stanning were the only Wrykinians up to Aldershot form . Drummond would have been almost a certainty for a silver medal , and Stanning would probably have been a runner-up . And here they were , both injured; Wrykyn would not have a single representative at the Queens Avenue Gymnasium . It would be a set-back to the cult of boxing at the school .  Mr Spence was pondering over this unfortunate state of things when Sheen was shown in .  Can I speak to you for a minute , sir ? said Sheen .  Certainly , Sheen . Take one of those cig--I mean , sit down . What is it ?  Sheen had decided how to open the interview before knocking at the door . He came to the point at once .  Do you think I could go down to Aldershot , sir ? he asked .  Mr Spence looked surprised .  Go down ? You mean-- ? Do you want to watch the competition ? Really , I dont know if the headmaster--  I mean , can I box ?  Mr Spences look of surprise became more marked .  Box ? he said . But surely--I didnt know you were a boxer , Sheen .  Ive only taken it up lately .  But you didnt enter for the House Competitions , did you ? What weight are you ?  Just under ten stone .  A light-weight . Why , Linton boxed for your house in the Light-Weights surely ?  Yes sir . They wouldnt let me go in .  You hurt yourself ?  No , sir .  Then why wouldnt they let you go in ?  Drummond thought Linton was better . He didnt know I boxed .  But--this is very curious . I dont understand it at all . You see , if you were not up to House form , you would hardly--At Aldershot , you see , you would meet the best boxers of all the public schools .  Yes , sir .  There was a pause .  It was like this , sir , said Sheen nervously . At the beginning of the term there was a bit of a row down in the town , and I got mixed up in it . And I didnt--I was afraid to join in . I funked it .  Mr Spence nodded . He was deeply interested now . The office of confessor is always interesting .  Go on , Sheen . What happened then ?  I was cut by everybody . The fellows thought I had let the house down , and it got about , and the other houses scored off them , so I had rather a rotten time .  Here it occurred to him that he was telling his story without that attention to polite phraseology which a master expects from a boy , so he amended the last sentence .  I didnt have a very pleasant time , sir , was his correction .  Well ? said Mr Spence .  So I was a bit sick , continued Sheen , relapsing once more into the vernacular , and I wanted to do something to put things right again , and I met--anyhow , I took up boxing . I wanted to box for the house , if I was good enough . I practised every day , and stuck to it , and after a bit I did become pretty good .  Well ?  Then Drummond got mumps , and I wrote to him asking if I might represent the house instead of him , and I suppose he didnt believe I was any good . At any rate , he wouldnt let me go in . Then Joe--a man who knows something about boxing--suggested I should go down to Aldershot .  Joe ? said Mr Spence inquiringly .  Sheen had let the name slip out unintentionally , but it was too late now to recall it .  Joe Bevan , sir , he said . He used to be champion of England , light-weight .  Joe Bevan! cried Mr Spence . Really ? Why , he trained me when I boxed for Cambridge . Hes one of the best of fellows . Ive never seen any one who took such trouble with his man . I wish we could get him here . So it was Joe who suggested that you should go down to Aldershot ? Well , he ought to know . Did he say you would have a good chance ?  Yes , sir .  My position is this , you see , Sheen . There is nothing I should like more than to see the school represented at Aldershot . But I cannot let anyone go down , irrespective of his abilities . Aldershot is not childs play . And in the Light-Weights you get the hardest fighting of all . It wouldnt do for me to let you go down if you are not up to the proper form . You would be half killed .  I should like to have a shot , sir , said Sheen .  Then this year , as you probably know , Ripton are sending down Peteiro for the Light-Weights . He was the fellow whom Drummond only just beat last year . And you saw the state in which Drummond came back . If Drummond could hardly hold him , what would you do ?  I believe I could beat Drummond , sir , said Sheen .  Mr Spences eyes opened wider . Here were brave words . This youth evidently meant business . The thing puzzled him . On the one hand , Sheen had been cut by his house for cowardice . On the other , Joe Bevan , who of all men was best able to judge , had told him that he was good enough to box at Aldershot .  Let me think it over , Sheen , he said . This is a matter which I cannot decide in a moment . I will tell you tomorrow what I think about it .  I hope you will let me go down , sir , said Sheen . Its my one chance .  Yes , yes , I see that , I see that , said Mr Spence , but all the same--well , I will think it over .  All the rest of that evening he pondered over the matter , deeply perplexed . It would be nothing less than cruel to let Sheen enter the ring at Aldershot if he were incompetent . Boxing in the Public Schools Boxing Competition is not a pastime for the incompetent . But he wished very much that Wrykyn should be represented , and also he sympathised with Sheens eagerness to wipe out the stain on his honour , and the honour of the house . But , like Drummond , he could not help harbouring a suspicion that this was a pose . He felt that Sheen was intoxicated by his imagination . Every one likes to picture himself doing dashing things in the limelight , with an appreciative multitude to applaud . Would this mood stand the test of action ?  Against this there was the evidence of Joe Bevan . Joe had said that Sheen was worthy to fight for his school , and Joe knew .  Mr Spence went to bed still in a state of doubt .  Next morning he hit upon a solution of the difficulty . Wandering in the grounds before school , he came upon OHara , who , as has been stated before , had won the Light-Weights at Aldershot in the previous year . He had come to Wrykyn for the Sports . Here was the man to help him . OHara should put on the gloves with Sheen and report .  Im in rather a difficulty , OHara , he said , and you can help me .  Whats that ? inquired OHara .  You know both our light-weights are on the sick list ? I had just resigned myself to going down to Aldershot without any one to box , when a boy in Seymours volunteered for the vacant place . I dont know if you knew him at school ? Sheen . Do you remember him ?  Sheen ? cried OHara in amazement . Not Sheen! . . .  His recollections of Sheen were not conducive to a picture of him as a public-school boxer .  Yes . I had never heard of him as a boxer . Still , he seems very anxious to go down , and he certainly has one remarkable testimonial , and as theres no one else--  And what shall I do ? asked OHara .  I want you , if you will , to give him a trial in the dinner-hour . Just see if hes any good at all . If he isnt , of course , dont hit him about a great deal . But if he shows signs of being a useful man , extend him . See what he can do .  Very well , sir , said OHara .  And you might look in at my house at tea-time , if you have nothing better to do , and tell me what you think of him .  At five oclock , when he entered Mr Spences study , OHaras face wore the awe-struck look of one who had seen visions .  Well ? said Mr Spence . Did you find him any good ?  Good ? said OHara . Hell beat them all . Hes a champion . Theres no stopping him .  What an extraordinary thing! said Mr Spence .     XX  SHEEN GOES TO ALDERSHOT   At Sheens request Mr Spence made no announcement of the fact that Wrykyn would be represented in the Light-Weights . It would be time enough , Sheen felt , for the School to know that he was a boxer when he had been down and shown what he could do . His appearance in his new role would be the most surprising thing that had happened in the place for years , and it would be a painful anti-climax if , after all the excitement which would be caused by the discovery that he could use his hands , he were to be defeated in his first bout . Whereas , if he happened to win , the announcement of his victory would be all the more impressive , coming unexpectedly . To himself he did not admit the possibility of defeat . He had braced himself up for the ordeal , and he refused to acknowledge to himself that he might not come out of it well . Besides , Joe Bevan continued to express hopeful opinions .  Just you keep your head , sir , he said , and youll win . Lots of these gentlemen , theyre champions when theyre practising , and youd think nothing wouldnt stop them when they get into the ring . But they get wild directly they begin , and forget everything theyve been taught , and where are they then ? Why , on the floor , waiting for the referee to count them out .  This picture might have encouraged Sheen more if he had not reflected that he was just as likely to fall into this error as were his opponents .  What you want to remember is to keep that guard up . Nothing can beat that . And push out your left straight . The straight left rules the boxing world . And be earnest about it . Be as friendly as you like afterwards , but while youre in the ring say to yourself , Well , its you or me , and dont be too kind .  I wish you could come down to second me , Joe , said Sheen .  Ill have a jolly good try , sir , said Joe Bevan . Let me see . Youll be going down the night before--I cant come down then , but Ill try and manage it by an early train on the day .  How about Francis ?  Oh , Francis can look after himself for one day . Hes not the sort of boy to run wild if hes left alone for a few hours .  Then you think you can manage it ?  Yes , sir . If Im not there for your first fight , I shall come in time to second you in the final .  If I get there , said Sheen .  Good secondings half the battle . These soldiers they give you at Aldershot--well , they dont know the business , as the saying is . They dont look after their man , not like I could . I saw young whats-his-name , of Rugby--Stevens: he was beaten in the final by a gentleman from Harrow--I saw him fight there a couple of years ago . After the first round he was leading--not by much , but still , he was a point or two ahead . Well! He went to his corner and his seconds sent him up for the next round in the same state hed got there in . They hadnt done a thing to him . Why , if Id been in his corner Id have taken him and sponged him and sent him up again as fresh as he could be . You must have a good second if youre to win . When youre all on top of your man , I dont say . But you get a young gentleman of your own class , just about as quick and strong as you are , and then youll know where the seconding comes in .  Then , for goodness sake , dont make any mistake about coming down , said Sheen .  Ill be there , sir , said Joe Bevan .         *       *       *       *       *  The Queens Avenue Gymnasium at Aldershot is a roomy place , but it is always crowded on the Public Schools Day . Sisters and cousins and aunts of competitors flock there to see Tommy or Bobby perform , under the impression , it is to be supposed , that he is about to take part in a pleasant frolic , a sort of merry parlour game . What their opinion is after he emerges from a warm three rounds is not known . Then there are soldiers in scores . Their views on boxing as a sport are crisp and easily defined . What they want is Gore . Others of the spectators are Old Boys , come to see how the school can behave in an emergency , and to find out whether there are still experts like Jones , who won the Middles in 96 or Robinson , who was runner-up in the Feathers in the same year; or whether , as they have darkly suspected for some time , the school has Gone To The Dogs Since They Left .  The usual crowd was gathered in the seats round the ring when Sheen came out of the dressing-room and sat down in an obscure corner at the end of the barrier which divides the gymnasium into two parts on these occasions . He felt very lonely . Mr Spence and the school instructor were watching the gymnastics , which had just started upon their lengthy course . The Wrykyn pair were not expected to figure high on the list this year . He could have joined Mr Spence , but , at the moment , he felt disinclined for conversation . If he had been a more enthusiastic cricketer , he would have recognised the feeling as that which attacks a batsman before he goes to the wicket . It is not precisely funk . It is rather a desire to accelerate the flight of Time , and get to business quickly . All things come to him who waits , and among them is that unpleasant sensation of a cold hand upon the portion of the body which lies behind the third waistcoat button .  The boxing had begun with a bout between two feather-weights , both obviously suffering from stage-fright . They were fighting in a scrambling and unscientific manner , which bore out Mr Bevans statements on the subject of losing ones head . Sheen felt that both were capable of better things . In the second and third rounds this proved to be the case and the contest came to an end amidst applause .  The next pair were light-weights , and Sheen settled himself to watch more attentively . From these he would gather some indication of what he might expect to find when he entered the ring . He would not have to fight for some time yet . In the drawing for numbers , which had taken place in the dressing-room , he had picked a three . There would be another light-weight battle before he was called upon . His opponent was a Tonbridgian , who , from the glimpse Sheen caught of him , seemed muscular . But he (Sheen) had the advantage in reach , and built on that .  After opening tamely , the light-weight bout had become vigorous in the second round , and both men had apparently forgotten that their right arms had been given them by Nature for the purpose of guarding . They were going at it in hurricane fashion all over the ring . Sheen was horrified to feel symptoms of a return of that old sensation of panic which had caused him , on that dark day early in the term , to flee Albert and his wicked works . He set his teeth , and fought it down . And after a bad minute he was able to argue himself into a proper frame of mind again . After all , that sort of thing looked much worse than it really was . Half those blows , which seemed as if they must do tremendous damage , were probably hardly felt by their recipient . He told himself that Francis , and even the knife-and-boot boy , hit fully as hard , or harder , and he had never minded them . At the end of the contest he was once more looking forward to his entrance to the ring with proper fortitude .  The fighting was going briskly forward now , sometimes good , sometimes moderate , but always earnest , and he found himself contemplating , without undue excitement , the fact that at the end of the bout which had just begun , between middle-weights from St Pauls and Wellington , it would be his turn to perform . As luck would have it , he had not so long to wait as he had expected , for the Pauline , taking the lead after the first few exchanges , out-fought his man so completely that the referee stopped the contest in the second round . Sheen got up from his corner and went to the dressing-room . The Tonbridgian was already there . He took off his coat . Somebody crammed his hands into the gloves and from that moment the last trace of nervousness left him . He trembled with the excitement of the thing , and hoped sincerely that no one would notice it , and think that he was afraid .  Then , amidst a clapping of hands which sounded faint and far-off , he followed his opponent to the ring , and ducked under the ropes .  The referee consulted a paper which he held , and announced the names .  R . D . Sheen , Wrykyn College .  Sheen wriggled his fingers right into the gloves , and thought of Joe Bevan . What had Joe said ? Keep that guard up . The straight left . Keep that guard--the straight left . Keep that--  A . W . Bird , Tonbridge School .  There was a fresh outburst of applause . The Tonbridgian had shown up well in the competition of the previous year , and the crowd welcomed him as an old friend .  Keep that guard up--straight left . Straight left--guard up .  Seconds out of the ring .  Guard up . Not too high . Straight left . It beats the world . What an age that man was calling Time . Guard up . Straight--  Time , said the referee .  Sheen , filled with a great calm , walked out of his corner and shook hands with his opponent .     XXI  A GOOD START   It was all over in half a minute .  The Tonbridgian was a two-handed fighter of the rushing type almost immediately after he had shaken hands . Sheen found himself against the ropes , blinking from a heavy hit between the eyes . Through the mist he saw his opponent sparring up to him , and as he hit he side-stepped . The next moment he was out in the middle again , with his man pressing him hard . There was a quick rally , and then Sheen swung his right at a venture . The blow had no conscious aim . It was purely speculative . But it succeeded . The Tonbridgian fell with a thud .  Sheen drew back . The thing seemed pathetic . He had braced himself up for a long fight , and it had ended in half a minute . His sensations were mixed . The fighting half of him was praying that his man would get up and start again . The prudent half realised that it was best that he should stay down . He had other fights before him before he could call that silver medal his own , and this would give him an invaluable start in the race . His rivals had all had to battle hard in their opening bouts .  The Tonbridgians rigidity had given place to spasmodic efforts to rise . He got on one knee , and his gloved hand roamed feebly about in search of a hold . It was plain that he had shot his bolt . The referee signed to his seconds , who ducked into the ring and carried him to his corner . Sheen walked back to his own corner , and sat down . Presently the referee called out his name as the winner , and he went across the ring and shook hands with his opponent , who was now himself again .  He overheard snatches of conversation as he made his way through the crowd to the dressing-room .  Useful boxer , that Wrykyn boy .  Shortest fight Ive seen here since Hopley won the Heavy-Weights .  Fluke , do you think ?  Dont know . Came to the same thing in the end , anyhow . Caught him fair .  Hard luck on that Tonbridge man . Hes a good boxer , really . Did well here last year .  Then an outburst of hand-claps drowned the speakers voices . A swarthy youth with the Ripton pink and green on his vest had pushed past him and was entering the ring . As he entered the dressing-room he heard the referee announcing the names . So that was the famous Peteiro! Sheen admitted to himself that he looked tough , and hurried into his coat and out of the dressing-room again so as to be in time to see how the Ripton terror shaped .  It was plainly not a one-sided encounter . Peteiros opponent hailed from St Pauls , a school that has a habit of turning out boxers . At the end of the first round it seemed that honours were even . The great Peteiro had taken as much as he had given , and once had been uncompromisingly floored by the Paulines left . But in the second round he began to gain points . For a boy of his weight he had a terrific hit with the right , and three applications of this to the ribs early in the round took much of the sting out of the Paulines blows . He fought on with undiminished pluck , but the Riptonian was too strong for him , and the third round was a rout . To quote the Sportsman of the following day , Peteiro crowded in a lot of work with both hands , and scored a popular victory .  Sheen looked thoughtful at the conclusion of the fight . There was no doubt that Drummonds antagonist of the previous year was formidable . Yet Sheen believed himself to be the cleverer of the two . At any rate , Peteiro had given no signs of possessing much cunning . To all appearances he was a tough , go-ahead fighter , with a right which would drill a hole in a steel plate . Had he sufficient skill to baffle his (Sheens) strong tactics ? If only Joe Bevan would come! With Joe in his corner to direct him , he would feel safe .  But of Joe up to the present there were no signs .  Mr Spence came and sat down beside him .  Well , Sheen , he said , so you won your first fight . Keep it up .  Ill try , sir , said Sheen .  What do you think of Peteiro ?  I was just wondering , sir . He hits very hard .  Very hard indeed .  But he doesnt look as if he was very clever .  Not a bit . Just a plain slogger . Thats all . Thats why Drummond beat him last year in the Feather-Weights . In strength there was no comparison , but Drummond was just too clever for him . You will be the same , Sheen .  I hope so , sir , said Sheen .         *       *       *       *       *  After lunch the second act of the performance began . Sheen had to meet a boxer from Harrow who had drawn a bye in the first round of the competition . This proved a harder fight than his first encounter , but by virtue of a stout heart and a straight left he came through it successfully , and there was no doubt as to what the decision would be . Both judges voted for him .  Peteiro demolished a Radleian in his next fight .  By the middle of the afternoon there were three light-weights in the running--Sheen , Peteiro , and a boy from Clifton . Sheen drew the bye , and sparred in an outer room with a soldier , who was inclined to take the thing easily . Sheen , with the thought of the final in his mind , was only too ready to oblige him . They sparred an innocuous three rounds , and the man of war was kind enough to whisper in his ear as they left the room that he hoped he would win the final , and that he himself had a matter of one-and-sixpence with Old Spud Smith on his success .  For Im a man , said the amiable warrior confidentially , as knows Class when he sees it . Youre Class , sir , thats what you are .  This , taken in conjunction with the fact that if the worst came to the worst he had , at any rate , won a medal by having got into the final , cheered Sheen . If only Joe Bevan had appeared he would have been perfectly contented .  But there were no signs of Joe .     XXII  A GOOD FINISH   Final , Light-Weights , shouted the referee .  A murmur of interest from the ring-side chairs .  R . D . Sheen , Wrykyn College .  Sheen got his full measure of applause this time . His victories in the preliminary bouts had won him favour with the spectators .  J . Peteiro , Ripton School .  Go it , Ripton! cried a voice from near the door . The referee frowned in the direction of this audacious partisan , and expressed a hope that the audience would kindly refrain from comment during the rounds .  Then he turned to the ring again , and announced the names a second time .  Sheen--Peteiro .  The Ripton man was sitting with a hand on each knee , listening to the advice of his school instructor , who had thrust head and shoulders through the ropes , and was busy impressing some point upon him . Sheen found himself noticing the most trivial things with extraordinary clearness . In the front row of the spectators sat a man with a parti-coloured tie . He wondered idly what tie it was . It was rather like one worn by members of Templars house at Wrykyn . Why were the ropes of the ring red ? He rather liked the colour . There was a man lighting a pipe . Would he blow out the match or extinguish it with a wave of the hand ? What a beast Peteiro looked . He really was a nigger . He must look out for that right of his . The straight left . Push it out . Straight left ruled the boxing world . Where was Joe ? He must have missed the train . Or perhaps he hadnt been able to get away . Why did he want to yawn , he wondered .  Time!  The Ripton man became suddenly active . He almost ran across the ring . A brief handshake , and he had penned Sheen up in his corner before he had time to leave it . It was evident what advice his instructor had been giving him . He meant to force the pace from the start .  The suddenness of it threw Sheen momentarily off his balance . He seemed to be in a whirl of blows . A sharp shock from behind . He had run up against the post . Despite everything , he remembered to keep his guard up , and stopped a lashing hit from his antagonists left . But he was too late to keep out his right . In it came , full on the weakest spot on his left side . The pain of it caused him to double up for an instant , and as he did so his opponent upper-cut him . There was no rest for him . Nothing that he had ever experienced with the gloves on approached this . If only he could get out of this corner .  Then , almost unconsciously , he recalled Joe Bevans advice .  If a mans got you in a corner , Joe had said , fall on him .  Peteiro made another savage swing . Sheen dodged it and hurled himself forward .  Break away , said a dispassionate official voice .  Sheen broke away , but now he was out of the corner with the whole good , open ring to manoeuvre in .  He could just see the Ripton instructor signalling violently to his opponent , and , in reply to the signals , Peteiro came on again with another fierce rush .  But Sheen in the open was a different person from Sheen cooped up in a corner . Francis Hunt had taught him to use his feet . He side-stepped , and , turning quickly , found his man staggering past him , over-balanced by the force of his wasted blow . And now it was Sheen who attacked , and Peteiro who tried to escape . Two swift hits he got in before his opponent could face round , and another as he turned and rushed . Then for a while the battle raged without science all over the ring . Gradually , with a cold feeling of dismay , Sheen realised that his strength was going . The pace was too hot . He could not keep it up . His left counters were losing their force . Now he was merely pushing his glove into the Ripton mans face . It was not enough . The other was getting to close quarters , and that right of his seemed stronger than ever .  He was against the ropes now , gasping for breath , and Peteiros right was thudding against his ribs . It could not last . He gathered all his strength and put it into a straight left . It took the Ripton man in the throat , and drove him back a step . He came on again . Again Sheen stopped him .  It was his last effort . He could do no more . Everything seemed black to him . He leaned against the ropes and drank in the air in great gulps .  Time! said the referee .  The word was lost in the shouts that rose from the packed seats .  Sheen tottered to his corner and sat down .  Keep it up , sir , keep it up , said a voice . Beart that the opposed may beware of thee . Dont forget the guard . And the straight left beats the world .  It was Joe--at the eleventh hour .  With a delicious feeling of content Sheen leaned back in his chair . It would be all right now . He felt that the matter had been taken out of his hands . A more experienced brain than his would look after the generalship of the fight .  As the moments of the half-minutes rest slid away he discovered the truth of Joes remarks on the value of a good second . In his other fights the napping of the towel had hardly stirred the hair on his forehead . Joes energetic arms set a perfect gale blowing . The cool air revived him . He opened his mouth and drank it in . A spongeful of cold water completed the cure . Long before the call of Time he was ready for the next round .  Keep away from him , sir , said Joe , and score with that left of yours . Dont try the right yet . Keep it for guarding . Box clever . Dont let him corner you . Slip him when he rushes . Cool and steady does it . Dont aim at his face too much . Go down below . Thats the de-partment . And use your feet . Get about quick , and youll find he dont like that . Hullo , says he , I cant touch him . Then , when hes tired , go in .  The pupil nodded with closed eyes .  While these words of wisdom were proceeding from the mouth of Mr Bevan , another conversation was taking place which would have interested Sheen if he could have heard it . Mr Spence and the school instructor were watching the final from the seats under the side windows .  Its extraordinary , said Mr Spence . The boys wonderfully good for the short time he has been learning . You ought to be proud of your pupil .  Sir ?  I was saying that Sheen does you credit .  Not me , sir .  What! He told me he had been taking lessons . Didnt you teach him ?  Never set eyes on him , till this moment . Wish I had , sir . Hes the sort of pupil I could wish for .  Mr Spence bent forward and scanned the features of the man who was attending the Wrykinian .  Why , he said , surely thats Bevan--Joe Bevan! I knew him at Cambridge .  Yes , sir , thats Bevan , replied the instructor . He teaches boxing at Wrykyn now , sir .  At Wrykyn--where ?  Up the river--at the Blue Boar , sir , said the instructor , quite innocently--for it did not occur to him that this simple little bit of information was just so much incriminating evidence against Sheen .  Mr Spence said nothing , but he opened his eyes very wide . Recalling his recent conversation with Sheen , he remembered that the boy had told him he had been taking lessons , and also that Joe Bevan , the ex-pugilist , had expressed a high opinion of his work . Mr Spence had imagined that Bevan had been a chance spectator of the boys skill; but it would now seem that Bevan himself had taught Sheen . This matter , decided Mr Spence , must be looked into , for it was palpable that Sheen had broken bounds in order to attend Bevans boxing-saloon up the river .  For the present , however , Mr Spence was content to say nothing .         *       *       *       *       *  Sheen came up for the second round fresh and confident . His head was clear , and his breath no longer came in gasps . There was to be no rallying this time . He had had the worst of the first round , and meant to make up his lost points .  Peteiro , losing no time , dashed in . Sheen met him with a left in the face , and gave way a foot . Again Peteiro rushed , and again he was stopped . As he bored in for the third time Sheen slipped him . The Ripton man paused , and dropped his guard for a moment .  Sheens left shot out once more , and found its mark . Peteiro swung his right viciously , but without effect . Another swift counter added one more point to Sheens score .  Sheen nearly chuckled . It was all so beautifully simple . What a fool he had been to mix it up in the first round . If he only kept his head and stuck to out-fighting he could win with ease . The man couldnt box . He was nothing more than a slogger . Here he came , as usual , with the old familiar rush . Out went his left . But it missed its billet . Peteiro had checked his rush after the first movement , and now he came in with both hands . It was the first time during the round that he had got to close quarters , and he made the most of it . Sheens blows were as frequent , but his were harder . He drove at the body , right and left; and once again the call of Time extricated Sheen from an awkward position . As far as points were concerned he had had the best of the round , but he was very sore and bruised . His left side was one dull ache .  Keep away from him , sir , said Joe Bevan . You were ahead on that round . Keep away all the time unless he gets tired . But if you see me signalling , then go in all you can and have a fight .  There was a suspicion of weariness about the look of the Ripton champion as he shook hands for the last round . He was beginning to feel the effects of his hurricane fighting in the opening rounds . He began quietly , sparring for an opening . Sheen led with his left . Peteiro was too late with his guard . Sheen tried again--a double lead . His opponent guarded the first blow , but the second went home heavily on the body , and he gave way a step .  Then from the corner of his eye Sheen saw Bevan gesticulating wildly , so , taking his life in his hands , he abandoned his waiting game , dropped his guard , and dashed in to fight . Peteiro met him doggedly . For a few moments the exchanges were even . Then suddenly the Riptonians blows began to weaken . He got home his right on the head , and Sheen hardly felt it . And in a flash there came to him the glorious certainty that the game was his .  He was winning--winning--winning .         *       *       *       *       *  Thats enough , said the referee .  The Ripton man was leaning against the ropes , utterly spent , at almost the same spot where Sheen had leaned at the end of the first round . The last attack had finished him . His seconds helped him to his corner .  The referee waved his hand .  Sheen wins , he said .  And that was the greatest moment of his life .     XXIII  A SURPRISE FOR SEYMOURS   Seymours house took in one copy of the Sportsman daily . On the morning after the Aldershot competition Linton met the paper-boy at the door on his return from the fives courts , where he had been playing a couple of before-breakfast games with Dunstable . He relieved him of the house copy , and opened it to see how the Wrykyn pair had performed in the gymnastics . He did not expect anything great , having a rooted contempt for both experts , who were small and , except in the gymnasium , obscure . Indeed , he had gone so far on the previous day as to express a hope that Biddle , the more despicable of the two , would fall off the horizontal bar and break his neck . Still he might as well see where they had come out . After all , with all their faults , they were human beings like himself , and Wrykinians .  The competition was reported in the Boxing column . The first thing that caught his eye was the name of the school among the headlines . Honours , said the headline , for St Pauls , Harrow , and Wrykyn .  Hullo , said Linton , whats all this ?  Then the thing came on him with nothing to soften the shock . He had folded the paper , and the last words on the half uppermost were , Final . Sheen beat Peteiro .  Linton had often read novels in which some important document swam before the eyes of the hero or the heroine; but he had never understood the full meaning of the phrase until he read those words , Sheen beat Peteiro .  There was no mistake about it . There the thing was . It was impossible for the Sportsman to have been hoaxed . No , the incredible , outrageous fact must be faced . Sheen had been down to Aldershot and won a silver medal! Sheen! Sheen!! Sheen who had--who was--well , who , in a word , was SHEEN!!!  Linton read on like one in a dream .  The Light-Weights fell , said the writer , to a newcomer Sheen , of Wrykyn (Sheen!) , a clever youngster with a strong defence and a beautiful straight left , doubtless the result of tuition from the middle-weight ex-champion , Joe Bevan , who was in his corner for the final bout . None of his opponents gave him much trouble except Peteiro of Ripton , whom he met in the final . A very game and determined fight was seen when these two met , but Sheens skill and condition discounted the rushing tactics of his adversary , and in the last minute of the third round the referee stopped the encounter . (Game and determined! Sheen!!) Sympathy was freely expressed for Peteiro , who has thus been runner-up two years in succession . He , however , met a better man , and paid the penalty . The admirable pluck with which Sheen bore his punishment and gradually wore his man down made his victory the most popular of the days programme .  Well!  Details of the fighting described Sheen as cutting out the work , popping in several nice lefts , swinging his right for the point , and executing numerous other incredible manoeuvres .  Sheen!  You caught the name correctly ? SHEEN , Ill trouble you .  Linton stared blankly across the school grounds . Then he burst into a sudden yell of laughter .  On that very morning the senior day-room was going to court-martial Sheen for disgracing the house . The resolution had been passed on the previous afternoon , probably just as he was putting the finishing touches to the most popular victory of the days programme . This , said Linton , is rich .  He grubbed a little hole in one of Mr Seymours flower-beds , and laid the Sportsman to rest in it . The news would be about the school at nine oclock , but if he could keep it from the senior day-room till the brief interval between breakfast and school , all would be well , and he would have the pure pleasure of seeing that backbone of the house make a complete ass of itself . A thought struck him . He unearthed the Sportsman , and put it in his pocket .  He strolled into the senior day-room after breakfast .  Any one seen the Sporter this morning ? he inquired .  No one had seen it .  The thing hasnt come , said some one .  Good! said Linton to himself .  At this point Stanning strolled into the room . Im a witness , he said , in answer to Lintons look of inquiry . Were doing this thing in style . I depose that I saw the prisoner cutting off on the--whatever day it was , when he ought to have been saving our lives from the fury of the mob . Hadnt somebody better bring the prisoner into the dock ?  Ill go , said Linton promptly . I may be a little time , but dont get worried . Ill bring him all right .  He went upstairs to Sheens study , feeling like an impresario about to produce a new play which is sure to create a sensation .  Sheen was in . There was a ridge of purple under his left eye , but he was otherwise intact .  Gratulate you , Sheen , said Linton .  For an instant Sheen hesitated . He had rehearsed this kind of scene in his mind , and sometimes he saw himself playing a genial , forgiving , lets-say-no-more-about-it-we-all-make-mistakes-but-in-future! role , sometimes being cold haughty , and distant , and repelling friendly advances with icy disdain . If anybody but Linton had been the first to congratulate him he might have decided on this second line of action . But he liked Linton , and wanted to be friendly with him .  Thanks , he said .  Linton sat down on the table and burst into a torrent of speech .  You are a man! What did you want to do it for ? Where the dickens did you learn to box ? And why on earth , if you can win silver medals at Aldershot , didnt you box for the house and smash up that sidey ass Stanning ? I say , look here , I suppose we havent been making idiots of ourselves all the time , have we ?  I shouldnt wonder , said Sheen . How ?  I mean , you did--What I mean to say is--Oh , hang it , you know! You did cut off when we had that row in the town , didnt you ?  Yes , said Sheen , I did .  With that medal in his pocket it cost him no effort to make the confession .  Im glad of that . I mean , Im glad we havent been such fools as we might have been . You see , we only had Stannings word to go on .  Sheen started .  Stanning! he said . What do you mean ?  He was the chap who started the story . Didnt you know ? He told everybody .  I thought it was Drummond , said Sheen blankly . You remember meeting me outside his study the day after ? I thought he told you then .  Drummond! Not a bit of it . He swore you hadnt been with him at all . He was as sick as anything when I said I thought Id seen you with him .  I-- Sheen stopped . I wish Id known , he concluded . Then , after a pause , So it was Stanning!  Yes ,--conceited beast . Oh . I say .  Um ?  I see it all now . Joe Bevan taught you to box .  Yes .  Then thats how you came to be at the Blue Boar that day . Hes the Bevan who runs it .  Thats his brother . Hes got a gymnasium up at the top . I used to go there every day .  But I say , Great Scott , what are you going to do about that ?  How do you mean ?  Why , Spence is sure to ask you who taught you to box . He must know you didnt learn with the instructor . Then itll all come out , and youll get dropped on for going up the river and going to the pub .  Perhaps he wont ask , said Sheen .  Hope not . Oh , by the way--  Whats up ?  Just remembered what I came up for . Its an awful rag . The senior day-room are going to court-martial you .  Court-martial me!  For funking . They dont know about Aldershot , not a word . I bagged the Sportsman early , and hid it . They are going to get the surprise of their lifetime . I said Id come up and fetch you .  I shant go , said Sheen .  Linton looked alarmed .  Oh , but I say , you must . Dont spoil the thing . Cant you see what a rag itll be ?  Im not going to sweat downstairs for the benefit of the senior day-room .  I say , said Linton , Stannings there .  What!  Hes a witness , said Linton , grinning .  Sheen got up .  Come on , he said .  Linton came on .         *       *       *       *       *  Down in the senior day-room the court was patiently awaiting the prisoner . Eager anticipation was stamped on its expressive features .  Beastly time he is , said Clayton . Clayton was acting as president .  We shall have to buck up , said Stanning . Hullo , here he is at last . Come in , Linton .  I was going to , said Linton , but thanks all the same . Come along , Sheen .  Shut that door , Linton , said Stanning from his seat on the table .  All right , Stanning , said Linton . Anything to oblige . Shall I bring up a chair for you to rest your feet on ?  Forge ahead , Clayton , said Stanning to the president .  The president opened the court-martial in unofficial phraseology .  Look here , Sheen , he said , weve come to the conclusion that this has got a bit too thick .  You mustnt talk in that chatty way , Clayton , interrupted Linton . Prisoner at the bars the right expression to use . Why dont you let somebody else have a look in ? Youre the rottenest president of a court-martial I ever saw .  Dont rag , Linton , said Clayton , with an austere frown . This is serious .  Glad you told me , said Linton . Go on .  Cant you sit down , Linton! said Stanning .  I was only waiting for leave . Thanks . You were saying something , Clayton . It sounded pretty average rot , but youd better unburden your soul .  The president resumed .  We want to know if youve anything to say--  You dont give him a chance , said Linton . You bag the conversation so .  --about disgracing the house .  By getting the Gotford , you know , Sheen , explained Linton . Clayton thinks that works a bad habit , and ought to be discouraged .  Clayton glared , and looked at Stanning . He was not equal to the task of tackling Linton himself .  Stanning interposed .  Dont rot , Linton . We havent much time as it is .  Sorry , said Linton .  Youve let the house down awfully , said Clayton .  Yes ? said Sheen .  Linton took the paper out of his pocket , and smoothed it out .  Seen the Sporter ? he asked casually . His neighbour grabbed at it .  I thought it hadnt come , he said .  Good account of Aldershot , said Linton .  He leaned back in his chair as two or three of the senior day-room collected round the Sportsman .  Hullo! We won the gym .!  Rot! Lets have a look!  This tremendous announcement quite eclipsed the court-martial as an object of popular interest . The senior day-room surged round the holder of the paper .  Give us a chance , he protested .  We cant have . Where is it ? Biddle and Smith are simply hopeless . How the dickens can they have got the shield ?  What a goat you are! said a voice reproachfully to the possessor of the paper . Look at this . It says Cheltenham got it . And here we are--seventeenth . Fat lot of shield weve won .  Then what the deuce does this mean ? Honours for St Pauls , Harrow , and Wrykyn .  Perhaps it refers to the boxing , suggested Linton .  But we didnt send any one up . Look here . Harrow won the Heavies . St Pauls got the Middles . Hullo!  Great Scott! said the senior day-room .  There was a blank silence . Linton whistled softly to himself .  The gaze of the senior day-room was concentrated on that ridge of purple beneath Sheens left eye .  Clayton was the first to speak . For some time he had been waiting for sufficient silence to enable him to proceed with his presidential duties . He addressed himself to Sheen .  Look here , Sheen , he said , we want to know what youve got to say for yourself . You go disgracing the house--  The stunned senior day-room were roused to speech .  Oh , chuck it , Clayton .  Dont be a fool , Clayton .  Silly idiot!  Clayton looked round in pained surprise at this sudden withdrawal of popular support .  Youd better be polite to Sheen , said Linton; he won the Light-Weights at Aldershot yesterday .  The silence once more became strained .  Well , said Sheen , werent you going to court-martial me , or something ? Clayton , werent you saying something ?  Clayton started . He had not yet grasped the situation entirely; but he realised dimly that by some miracle Sheen had turned in an instant into a most formidable person .  Er--no , he said . No , nothing .  The thing seems to have fallen through , Sheen , said Linton . Great pity . Started so well , too . Clayton always makes a mess of things .  Then Id just like to say one thing , said Sheen .  Respectful attention from the senior day-room .  I only want to know why you cant manage things of this sort by yourselves , without dragging in men from other houses .  Especially men like Stanning , said Linton . The same thing occurred to me . Its lucky Drummond wasnt here . Remember the last time , you chaps ?  The chaps did . Stanning became an object of critical interest . After all , who was Stanning ? What right had he to come and sit on tables in Seymours and interfere with the affairs of the house ?  The allusion to last time was lost upon Sheen , but he saw that it had not improved Stannings position with the spectators .  He opened the door .  Good bye , Stanning , he said .  If I hadnt hurt my wrist-- Stanning began .  Hurt your wrist! said Sheen . You got a bad attack of Peteiro . That was what was the matter with you .  You think that every ones a funk like yourself , said Stanning .  Pity they arent , said Linton; we should do rather well down at Aldershot . And he wasnt such a terror after all , Sheen , was he ? You beat him in two and a half rounds , didnt you ? Think what Stanning might have done if only he hadnt sprained his poor wrist just in time .  Look here , Linton--  Some are born with sprained wrists , continued the speaker , some achieve sprained wrists--like Stanning--  Stanning took a step towards him .  Dont forget youve a sprained wrist , said Linton .  Come on , Stanning , said Sheen , who was still holding the door open , youll be much more comfortable in your own house . Ill show you out .  I suppose , said Stanning in the passage , you think youve scored off me .  That , said Sheen pleasantly , is rather the idea . Good bye .     XXIV  BRUCE EXPLAINS   Mr Spence was a master with a great deal of sympathy and a highly developed sense of duty . It was the combination of these two qualities which made it so difficult for him to determine on a suitable course of action in relation to Sheens out-of-bounds exploits . As a private individual he had nothing but admiration for the sporting way in which Sheen had fought his up-hill fight . He felt that he himself in similar circumstances would have broken any number of school rules . But , as a master , it was his duty , he considered , to report him . If a master ignored a breach of rules in one case , with which he happened to sympathise , he would in common fairness be compelled to overlook a similar breach of rules in other cases , even if he did not sympathise with them . In which event he would be of small use as a master .  On the other hand , Sheens case was so exceptional that he might very well compromise to a certain extent between the claims of sympathy and those of duty . If he were to go to the headmaster and state baldly that Sheen had been in the habit for the last half-term of visiting an up-river public-house , the headmaster would get an entirely wrong idea of the matter , and suspect all sorts of things which had no existence in fact . When a boy is accused of frequenting a public-house , the head-magisterial mind leaps naturally to Stale Fumes and the Drunken Stagger .  So Mr Spence decided on a compromise . He sent for Sheen , and having congratulated him warmly on his victory in the Light-Weights , proceeded as follows:  You have given me to understand , Sheen , that you were taught boxing by Bevan ?  Yes , sir .  At the Blue Boar ?  Yes , sir .  This puts me in a rather difficult position , Sheen . Much as I dislike doing it , I am afraid I shall have to report this matter to the headmaster .  Sheen said he supposed so . He saw Mr Spences point .  But I shall not mention the Blue Boar . If I did , the headmaster might get quite the wrong impression . He would not understand all the circumstances . So I shall simply mention that you broke bounds by going up the river . I shall tell him the whole story , you understand , and its quite possible that you will hear no more of the affair . Im sure I hope so . But you understand my position ?  Yes , sir .  Thats all , then , Sheen . Oh , by the way , you wouldnt care for a game of fives before breakfast tomorrow , I suppose ?  I should like it , sir .  Not too stiff ?  No , sir .  Very well , then . Ill be there by a quarter-past seven .         *       *       *       *       *  Jack Bruce was waiting to see the headmaster in his study at the end of afternoon school .  Well , Bruce , said the headmaster , coming into the room and laying down some books on the table , do you want to speak to me ? Will you give your father my congratulations on his victory . I shall be writing to him tonight . I see from the paper that the polling was very even . Apparently one or two voters arrived at the last moment and turned the scale .  Yes , sir .  It is a most gratifying result . I am sure that , apart from our political views , we should all have been disappointed if your father had not won . Please congratulate him sincerely .  Yes , sir .  Well , Bruce , and what was it that you wished to see me about ?  Bruce was about to reply when the door opened , and Mr Spence came in .  One moment , Bruce , said the headmaster . Yes , Spence ?  Mr Spence made his report clearly and concisely . Bruce listened with interest . He thought it hardly playing the game for the gymnasium master to hand Sheen over to be executed at the very moment when the school was shaking hands with itself over the one decent thing that had been done for it in the course of the athletic year; but he told himself philosophically that he supposed masters had to do these things . Then he noticed with some surprise that Mr Spence was putting the matter in a very favourable light for the accused . He was avoiding with some care any mention of the Blue Boar . When he had occasion to refer to the scene of Sheens training , he mentioned it vaguely as a house .  This man Bevan , who is an excellent fellow and a personal friend of my own , has a house some way up the river .  Of course a public-house is a house .  Up the river , said the headmaster meditatively .  It seemed that that was all that was wrong . The prosecution centred round that point , and no other . Jack Bruce , as he listened , saw his way of coping with the situation .  Thank you , Spence , said the headmaster at the conclusion of the narrative . I quite understand that Sheens conduct was very excusable . But--I distinctly said--I placed the upper river out of bounds . . . . Well , I will see Sheen , and speak to him . I will speak to him .  Mr Spence left the room .  Please sir-- said Jack Bruce .  Ah , Bruce . I am afraid I have kept you some little time . Yes ?  I couldnt help hearing what Mr Spence was saying to you about Sheen , sir . I dont think he knows quite what really happened .  You mean-- ?  Sheen went there by road . I used to take him in my motor .  Your--! What did you say , Bruce ?  My motor-car , sir . Thats to say , my fathers . We used to go together every day .  I am glad to hear it . I am glad . Then I need say nothing to Sheen after all . I am glad . . . . But--er--Bruce , proceeded the headmaster after a pause .  Yes , sir ?  Do you--are you in the habit of driving a motor-car frequently ?  Every day , sir . You see , I am going to take up motors when I leave school , so its all education .  The headmaster was silent . To him the word Education meant Classics . There was a Modern side at Wrykyn , and an Engineering side , and also a Science side; but in his heart he recognised but one Education--the Classics . Nothing that he had heard , nothing that he had read in the papers and the monthly reviews had brought home to him the spirit of the age and the fact that Things were not as they used to be so clearly as this one remark of Jack Bruces . For here was Bruce admitting that in his spare time he drove motors . And , stranger still , that he did it not as a wild frolic but seriously , with a view to his future career .  The old order changeth , thought the headmaster a little sadly .  Then he brought himself back from his mental plunge into the future .  Well , well , Bruce , he said , we need not discuss the merits and demerits of driving motor-cars , need we ? What did you wish to see me about ?  I came to ask if I might get off morning school tomorrow , sir . Those voters who got to the poll just in time and settled the election--I brought them down in the car . And the policeman--hes a Radical , and voted for Pedder--Mr Pedder--has sworn--says I was exceeding the speed-limit .  The headmaster pressed a hand to his forehead , and his mind swam into the future .  Well , Bruce ? he said at length , in the voice of one whom nothing can surprise now .  He says I was going twenty-eight miles an hour . And if I can get to the Court tomorrow morning I can prove that I wasnt . I brought them to the poll in the little runabout .  And the--er--little runabout , said the headmaster , does not travel at twenty-eight miles an hour ?  No , sir . It cant go more than twenty at the outside .  Very well , Bruce , you need not come to school tomorrow morning .  Thank you , sir .  The headmaster stood thinking . . . . The new order . . . .  Bruce , he said .  Yes , sir ?  Tell me , do I look very old ?  Bruce stared .  Do I look three hundred years old ?  No , sir , said Bruce , with the stolid wariness of the boy who fears that a master is subtly chaffing him .  I feel more , Bruce , said the headmaster , with a smile . I feel more . You will remember to congratulate your father for me , wont you ?         *       *       *       *       *  Outside the door Jack Bruce paused in deep reflection . Rum! he said to himself . Jolly rum!         *       *       *       *       *  On the senior gravel he met Sheen .  Hullo , Sheen , he said , what are you going to do ?  Drummond wants me to tea with him in the infirmary .  Its all right , then ?  Yes . I got a note from him during afternoon school . You coming ?  All right . I say , Sheen , the Old Mans rather rum sometimes , isnt he ?  Whats he been doing now ?  Oh--nothing . How do you feel after Aldershot ? Tell us all about it . Ive not heard a word yet . Well , wife , said Mr . Benjamin Stanton , as he sat down to a late breakfast , I had a letter from Ohio yesterday .  From Ohio ? Who should write you from Ohio ? Anyone I know ?  My sister , Margaret , you remember , moved out there with her husband ten years ago .  Oh , its from her , is it ? said Mrs . Stanton , indifferently .  No , said her husband with momentary gravity . Its from a Dr . Kent , who attended her in her last illness . Margaret is dead!  Dear me! returned Mrs . Stanton , uncomfortably; and I am just out of mourning for my aunt . Do you think it will be necessary for us to go into mourning for your sister ?  No , I think not , said her husband . Margaret has lived away from us so long , and people wont know that we have had a death in the family unless we mention it .  Was that all the letter said--about the death , I mean ?  Why , no , said Mr . Stanton , with a little frown . It seems Margaret left a child--a boy of fourteen; and , as she left no property , the doctor suggests that I should send for the boy and assume the care of him .  Upon my word! said Mrs . Stanton; you will find yourself in business if you undertake to provide for all the beggars brats that apply to you for assistance .  You must remember that you are speaking of my sisters child , said Mr . Stanton , who , cold and selfish and worldly as he was , had some touch of decency about him , and did not relish the term beggars brats , as applied to one so nearly related to him .  Well , call him what you like , said his wife; only dont be so foolish as to go spending your money on him when our children need all we have . Theres Maria needs a new dress immediately . She says all the girls at Signor Madalinis dancing academy dress elegantly , and shes positively ashamed to appear in any of her present dresses .  How much will it cost ? asked Mr . Stanton , opening his pocketbook .  You may hand me seventy-five dollars . I think I can make that do .  Without a word of remonstrance , the money was placed in her hand .  I want some money , too , said Tom Stanton , who had just disposed of a very hearty meal .  What do you want it for , Tom ?  Oh , some of the fellows are getting up a club . Its going to be a select affair , and of course each of us has got to contribute some money . You see , we are going to hire a room , furnish it nicely with a carpet , black walnut furniture , and so on , and thatll cost something .  Whose idea is it ?  Well , Sam Paget was the first boy that mentioned it .  Whose son is he ?  His father belongs to the firm of Paget , Norwood & Co . Hes awful rich .  Yes , it is one of our first families , said Mr . Stanton , with satisfaction . Is he a friend of yours , Tom ?  Oh , yes , we are quit intimate .  Thats right! said his father , approvingly . I am glad you choose your friends so well . Thats one of the principal reasons I have for sending you to an expensive school , to get you well launched into good society .  Yes , father , I understand , said Tom . You wont find me associating with common boys . I hold my head a little too high for that , I can tell you .  Thats right , my boy , said Mr . Stanton , with satisfaction . And now how much money do you want for this club of yours ?  Well , said Tom , hesitatingly , thirty or forty dollars .  Isnt that considerable ? said his father , surprised at the amount .  Well , you see , father , I want to contribute as much as any of the boys . It would seem mean if I didnt . Theres only a few of us to stand the expense , and we dont want to let in any out of our own set .  Thats true , said Mr . Stanton; I approve of that . Its all very well to talk about democracy , but I believe in those of the higher orders keeping by themselves .  Then youll give the money , father ? said Tom , eagerly .  Yes , Tom , theres forty dollars . Its more than I ought to spare , but I am determined you shall stand as good a chance as any of your school-fellows . They shant be able to say that your father stints you in anything that your position requires .  Thank you , father , said Tom , pocketing the two twenty-dollar bills with great satisfaction .  The fact was that Toms assessment amounted to only twenty dollars , but he thought it would be a good excuse for getting more out of his father . As to the extra money , Tom felt confident that he could find uses enough for it . He had latterly , though but fourteen years of age , contracted the habit of smoking cigars; a habit which he found rather expensive , especially as he felt bound occasionally to treat his companions . Then he liked , now and then , to drop in and get an ice-cream or some confectionery , and these little expenses counted up .  Mr . Stanton was a vain , worldly man . He was anxious to obtain an entrance into the best society . For this reason , he made it a point to send his children to the most expensive schools; trusting to their forming fashionable acquaintances , through whom his whole family might obtain recognition into those select circles for which he cherished a most undemocratic respect . For this reason it was that , though not naturally liberal , he had opened his purse willingly at the demands of Mrs . Stanton and Tom .  Well , said Mrs . Stanton , after Toms little financial affair had been adjusted , what are you going to write to this doctor ? Of course you wont think of sending for your nephew ?  By no means . He is much better off where he is . I shall write Dr . Kent that he is old enough to earn his own living , and I shall recommend that he be bound out to some farmer or mechanic in the neighborhood . It is an imposition to expect , because I am tolerably well off , that it is my duty to support other peoples children . My own are entitled to all I can do for them .  Thats so , father , said Tom , who was ready enough to give his consent to any proposition of a selfish nature . Charity begins at home .  With Tom , by the way , it not only began at home , but it ended there , and the same may be said of his father . From time to time Mr . Stantons name was found in the list of donors to some charitable object , provided his benevolence was likely to obtain sufficient publicity , Mr . Stanton did not believe in giving in secret . What was the use of giving away money unless you could get credit for it ? That was the principle upon which he always acted .  I suppose , continued Tom , this country cousin of mine wears cowhide boots and overalls , and has got rough , red hands like a common laborer . I wonder what Sam Paget would say if I should introduce such a fellow to him as my cousin . I rather guess he would not want to be quite so intimate with me as he is now .  If anything had been needed , this consideration would have been sufficient to deter Mr . Stanton from sending for his nephew . He could not permit the social standing of his family to be compromised by the presence of a poor relation from the country , rough and unpolished as he doubtless was .  Maria , too , who had been for some time silent , here contributed to strengthen the effect of Toms words .  Yes , said she , and Laura Brooks , my most intimate friend , who is shocked at anything vulgar or countrified--I wouldnt have her know that I have such a cousin--oh , not for the world!  There will be no occasion for it , said her father , decidedly . I shall write at once to this Dr . Kent , explaining to him my views and wishes , and how impossible it is for me to do as he so inconsiderately suggests .  Its the wisest thing you can do , Mr . Stanton , said his wife , who was to the full as selfish as her husband .  What is his name , father ? asked Maria .  Whose name ?  The boys .  Herbert Mason .  Herbert ? I thought it might be Jonathan , or Zeke , or some such name . Herbert isnt at all countrified .  No , said Tom , slyly; of course not . We all know why you like that name .  Oh , youre mighty wise , Mr . Tom! retorted his sister .  Its because you like Herbert Dartmouth; but it isnt any use . Hes in love with Lizzie Graves .  You seem to know all about it , said Maria , with vexation; for Tom was not far from right in speaking of her preference for Herbert Dartmouth .  Of course I do , said Tom; I ought to , for he told me so himself .  I dont believe it! said Maria , who looked ready to cry .  Well , you neednt; but its so .  Be quiet , children , said Mrs . Stanton . Thomas , you mustnt plague your sister .  Dont take it so hard , Maria , said Tom , in rather an aggravating tone . Theres other boys you could get . I guess you could get Jim Gorham for a beau , if you tried hard enough .  I wouldnt have him , said Maria . His face is all over freckles .  Enough of this quarreling , children , said Mrs . Stanton . I hope , she continued , addressing her husband , you wont fail to write at once . They might be sending on the boy , and then we should be in a pretty predicament .  I will write at once . I dont know but I ought to inclose some money .  I dont see why you need to .  Perhaps I had better , as this is the last I intend to do for him .  At any rate , it wont be necessary to send much , said Mrs . Stanton .  How much ?  Five dollars will do , I should think . Because he happens to be your nephew , there is no good reason why he should be thrown upon you for support .  Perhaps it will be best to send ten dollars , said Mr . Stanton . People are unreasonable , you know , and they might charge me with meanness , if I sent less .  Then make it ten . Its only for once . I hope that will be the last we shall hear of him .  The room in which this conversation took place was a handsomely furnished breakfast room , all the appointments of which spoke not only of comfort , but of luxury . Mr . Stanton had been made rich by a series of lucky speculations , and he was at present carrying on a large wholesale store downtown . He had commenced with small means twenty years before , and for some years had advanced slowly , until the tide of fortune set in and made him rich . His present handsome residence he had only occupied three years , having moved to it from one of much smaller pretensions on Bleecker Street . Tom and Maria were forbidden to speak of their former home to their present fashionable acquaintances , and this prohibition they were likely to observe , having inherited to the full the worldly spirit which actuated their parents . It will be seen that Herbert Mason was little likely to be benefited by having such prosperous relations .     CHAPTER II  INTRODUCING THE HERO   If my young readers do not find the town of Waverley on the map of Ohio , they may conclude that it was too small to attract the notice of the map-makers . The village is small , consisting of about a dozen houses , a church , a schoolhouse , and , as a matter of course , one of that well-known class of stores in which everything required for the family is sold , from a dress-pattern to a pound of sugar . Outside of the village there are farmhouses , surrounded by broad acres , which keep them at respectable distances from each other , like the feudal castles of the Middle Ages . The land is good , and the farmers are thrifty and well-to-do; but probably the whole town contains less than a thousand inhabitants .  In one of the houses , near the church , lived Dr . Kent , whose letter has already been referred to . He was a skillful physician , and a very worthy man , who would have been very glad to be benevolent if his limited practice had supplied him with the requisite means . But chance had directed him to a healthy and sparsely-settled neighborhood , where he was able only to earn a respectable livelihood , and indeed found himself compelled to economize at times where he would have liked to indulge himself in expense .  When Mrs . Mason died it was found that the sale of her furniture barely realized enough to defray the expenses of her funeral . Herbert , her only son , was left wholly unprovided for . Dr . Kent , knowing that he had a rich uncle in New York , undertook to communicate to him the position in which his nephew had been left , never doubting that he would cheerfully extend a helping hand to him . Meanwhile he invited Herbert to come to his house and make it his home till his uncle should send for him .  Herbert was a handsome , well-grown boy of fourteen , and a general favorite in the village . While his mother lived he had done all he could to lighten her tasks , and he grieved deeply for her loss now that she was gone . His father had ten years before failed in business in the city of New York , and , in a fit of depression , had emigrated to this obscure country village , where he had invested the few hundred dollars remaining to him in a farm , from which he was able to draw a scanty income . Being a man of liberal education , he had personally superintended the education of his son till his death , two years before , so that Herberts attainments were considerably in advance of those of other boys of his age in the neighborhood . He knew something of Latin and French , which made him looked upon as quite a model of learning by his playmates . After his fathers death he had continued the daily study of the languages , so that he was able to read ordinary French with nearly as much ease as if it were English . Though studious , he was not a bookworm , but was distinguished in athletic sports popular with boys of his age .  Enough has been said of our hero by way of introduction . Herberts faults and virtues will appear as the record of his adventures is continued . It may be hinted only that , while he was frank , manly , and generous in his disposition , he was proud and high-spirited also , and perhaps these qualities were sometimes carried to excess . He would not allow himself to be imposed upon if he could help it . Being strong for his age , he was always able to maintain his rights , but never abused his strength by making it the instrument of tyrannizing over weaker boys .  Of course Herbert felt somewhat anxious as to his future prospects . He knew that the doctor had written to his Uncle Benjamin about him , and he hoped that he might be sent for to New York , having a great curiosity to see the city , of which he had heard so much .  Have you heard from my uncle , Dr . Kent ? he inquired , a few days after the scene recorded in our first chapter .  His question was prompted by seeing the doctor coming into the yard with an open letter in his hand .  Yes , said Dr . Kent , with troubled expression and perplexed took .  What does Uncle Benjamin say ? asked our young hero , eagerly .  Nothing very encouraging , Herbert , I am sorry to say , returned the doctor . However , here is the letter; you may read it for yourself .  Herbert received the letter from the doctors hands and read it through with feelings of mortification and anger .  Here it is:  DEAR SIR: I have to acknowledge yours of the 10th inst . I regret to hear of my sisters decease . I regret , also , to hear that her son , Herbert , is left without a provision for his support . My brother-in-law I cannot but consider culpable in neglecting to lay up something during his life upon which his widow and son might depend . I suspect that he must have lived with inconsiderate extravagance .  As for myself , I have a family of my own to provide for , and the expense of living in a city like this is very great . In justice to them , I do not feel that it would be right for me to incur extra expense . You tell me that he is now fourteen and a stout boy . He is able , I should think , to earn his own living . I should recommend that he be bound out to a farmer or mechanic . To defray any little expenses that may arise , I enclose ten dollars , which I hope he may find serviceable . Yours etc . ,  BENJAMIN STANTON .  This cold and selfish letter Herbert read with rising color , and a feeling of bitterness found a place in his young heart , which was quite foreign to him .  Well , Herbert , what do you think of it ? asked the doctor .  I think , said Herbert , hotly , that I dont want to have anything to do with an uncle who could write such a letter as that .  He doesnt seem to write with much feeling . acknowledged the doctor .  Feeling! repeated Herbert; he writes as if I were a beggar , and asked charity . Where is the money he inclosed , Dr . Kent ?  I have it here in my vest pocket . I was afraid it would slip out of the letter , and so took care of it .  Will you let me send it back to my uncle ? asked Herbert .  Send it back ?  Yes , Dr . Kent; I dont want any of his charity , and Ill tell him so .  I am afraid , Herbert , that you are giving way to your pride .  But isnt it a proper pride , doctor ?  I hardly know what to say , Herbert . You must remember , however , that , as you are left quite unprovided for , even this small sum may be of use to you .  It isnt the smallness of the sum that I mind , said Herbert . If Uncle Benjamin had written a kind letter , or showed the least feeling in it for me , or for--for mother [his voice faltered a moment] , I would have accepted it thankfully . But I couldnt accept money thrown at me in that way . He didnt want to give it to me , I am sure , and wouldnt if he hadnt felt obliged to .  Dr . Kent paced the room thoughtfully . He respected Herberts feelings , but he saw that it was not wise for him to indulge them . He was in a dependent situation , and it was to be feared that he would have much to suffer in time to come from the coldness and selfishness of the world .  I will tell you what to do , Herbert , he said , after a while . You can accept this money as a loan , and repay it when you are able .  With interest ?  Yes , with interest , if you prefer it .  I shall be willing to accept it on those terms , said Herbert; but I want my uncle to understand it .  You may write to your uncle to that effect , if you like .  Very well , Dr . Kent . Then I will write to him at once .  You will find some paper in my desk , Herbert . I suppose you will not object to my seeing your letter .  No , doctor , I intended to show it to you . You wont expect me to show much gratitude , I hope ?  I wont insist upon it , Herbert , said the doctor , smiling .  Herbert in about half an hour submitted the following note to the doctors inspection . It had cost him considerable thought to determine how to express himself , but he succeeded at last to his tolerable satisfaction .  UNCLE BENJAMIN [so the letter commenced]: Dr . Kent has just shown me your reply to his letter about me . You seem to think I wish you to support me , which is not the case . All I should have asked was your influence to help me in obtaining a situation in the city , where I might support myself . I am willing to work , and shall probably find some opportunity here . The ten dollars , which you inclose , I will accept AS A LOAN , and will repay you as soon as I am able , WITH INTEREST . HERBERT MASON .  Will that do ? asked Herbert .  Dr . Kent smiled .  You were careful not to express any gratitude , Herbert , he said .  Because I dont feel any , returned Herbert , promptly . I feel grateful to you , Dr . Kent , for your great kindness . I wish I could pay you for that . I shall never forget how you attended my mother in her sickness , when there was small prospect of your being paid .  My dear boy , said the doctor , resting his hand affectionately on Herberts shoulder , I have been able to do but very little . I wish I could do more . If you wish to repay me , you can do it a hundred times over by growing up a good and honorable man; one upon whom your mother in heaven can look down with grateful joy , if it is permitted her to watch your progress here .  I will do my best , doctor , said Herbert .  The world is all before you , proceeded Dr . Kent . You may not achieve a brilliant destiny . It is permitted to few to do that . But whether your sphere is wide or narrow , you may exert an influence for good , AND LEAVE THE WORLD BETTER FOR YOUR HAVING LIVED IN IT .  I hope it may be so , said Herbert , thoughtfully . When I am tempted to do wrong , I will think of my mother .  It is the very best thing you can do , Herbert . And now for your plans . I wish I were in a situation to have you remain with me . But as that cannot be , I will do my best to get you a place .  I ought to be at work , said Herbert , as I have my living to get . I want you to take that ten dollars , doctor , as part payment of the debt I owe you .  The doctor shook his head .  I cant do that , Herbert , not even to oblige you . You were too proud to accept a favor from your uncle . You will not be too proud , I hope , to accept one from me ?  No , doctor; I am not too proud for that . You are my friend , and my uncle cares nothing for me .  When Herberts letter reached New York , his uncle felt a momentary shame , for he saw that his nephew had rightfully interpreted his own selfishness and lack of feeling , and he could not help involuntarily admiring the independent spirit which would not allow him to accept the proffered money , except as a loan . But mingled with his shame was a feeling of relief , as he foresaw that Herberts pride would not suffer him to become a burden upon him in the future . He hardly expected ever to see the ten dollars returned with interest; but even if he lost it , he felt that he should be getting off cheap .     CHAPTER III  A COLLISION   It was a week later when an incident befell Herbert which is worthy of mention , since it brought him into collision with a man who was destined to have some influence over his future life .  A neighboring farmer , for whom , during his mothers life , he had occasionally gone on errands , drove up in front of the doctors house , and asked Herbert if he could take his horse and wagon and drive over to the mill village to get some corn ground . Herbert was rather glad to accept this proposal , not only because he was to receive twenty-five cents for so doing , but also because he was fond of driving a horse .  He was only about a mile from the mill village , when he saw approaching him a man in a light open buggy . Herbert knew every horse in Waverley , and every man , woman , and child , for that matter , and he perceived at once that the driver was a stranger . To tell the truth , he was not very favorably impressed by his appearance . The man was very dark , with black hair and an unshaven beard of three days growth , which did not set off his irregular and repulsive features . His mouth , partly open , revealed several yellow tusks , stained with tobacco juice . On his head he wore a broad-brimmed straw hat , rather the worse for wear .  It so happened that just at this point the middle of the road was much better than the sides , which sloped considerably , terminating in gullies which were partly full from the recent rains . The road was narrow , being wide enough for two vehicles to pass each other , if each veered to the side , but not otherwise .  Herbert observed that the buggy , which was now rapidly approaching , was kept in the center of the road , and that the driver appeared to have no intention of turning out .  What does he mean ? thought our hero . He cannot expect me to do the whole of the turning out . I will turn out my half , and if he wants to get by , he must do the same .  Accordingly , he turned partially to one side , as much as could be reasonably expected , and quietly awaited the approach of the man in the buggy . The latter still kept the center of the road , and did not turn out his carriage at all . As soon as it was close at hand , the driver leaned forward and exclaimed angrily:  Turn out , boy!  If he expected that Herbert would be intimidated by his tone he was much mistaken . Our hero was bold , and not easily frightened . He looked quietly in the mans face , and said composedly , I have turned out .  Then turn out more , you young vagabond! Do you hear me ?  Yes , sir , I hear you , and should if you didnt speak half so loud .  Curse your impudence! I tell you , turn out more! exclaimed the stranger , becoming more and more angry . He had expected to get his own way without trouble . If Herbert had been a man , he would not have been so unreasonable; but he supposed he could browbeat a boy into doing whatever he chose to dictate . But he had met his match , as it turned out .  I have already given you half the road , said Herbert , firmly , and I dont intend to give you any more .  You dont , eh ? Young man , how old are you ?  I am fourteen .  I should think you were forty by the airs you put on .  Is it putting on airs to insist on my rights ? asked our hero .  Your rights! retorted the other , laughing contemptuously .  Yes , my rights , returned Herbert , quietly . I have a right to half of the road , and I have taken it . If I turn out any more , I shall go into the gully .  That makes no difference . A wetting wont do you any harm . Your impudence needs cooling .  That may be , said Herbert , who did not choose to get angry , but was resolved to maintain his rights; but I object to the wetting , for all that , and as this wagon is not mine , I do not choose to upset it .  You are the most insolent young scamp I ever came across! exclaimed the other , furiously . Ive a good mind to give you something much worse than a wetting .  Such as what ? asked our hero , coolly . In reply the man flourished his whip significantly . Do you see that ? he asked .  Yes .  Oh , very well , said the other , ironically; Im glad you do . Perhaps you wouldnt like to feel it ?  No , I dont think I should , said Herbert , not exhibiting the least apprehension .  The stranger handled his whip , eyeing our hero viciously at the same time , as if it would have afforded him uncommon pleasure to lay it over his back . But there was something in the look of our hero which unconsciously cowed him , and , much as he wished to strike him , he held back .  Well , youre a cool hand , he said , after a moments hesitation .  To this our hero did not see fit to make any reply . But he grasped his own whip a little tighter . So brutal had been the tone assumed by the stranger , that he was not sure but he might proceed to carry out his threat , and lay the whip over his back . He determined , in that case , to give him as good as he sent . I will not express any opinion as to the propriety of this determination , but I am certain , from what I know of our heros fearless spirit , that he would not have hesitated to do it , be the consequences what they might . But he did not have the opportunity .  Once more , demanded the stranger , furiously; are you going to turn out ?  No , said the boy , decidedly .  Then--Ill run you down .  So saying , he brought the whip violently on the horses back . The latter gave a convulsive spring forward . But his driver had not taken into consideration that the farm-wagon was the stronger of the two vehicles , and that in any collision the buggy must come off second best . So it happened that a wheel of the buggy was broken , and the driver , in the shock , thrown sprawling into a puddle on the other side of the road . The wagon suffered no damage , but the old horse , terrified , set off at a rapid pace . Herbert looked back to see if the stranger was injured , but seeing that he had already picked himself up unwounded , but decidedly dirty , he concluded to keep on his way to the mill .  The driver of the overturned vehicle was considerably more angry than hurt at this catastrophe .  It chafed his pride not a little to think that , after all his vaunts , the boy had maintained his ground , and got the better of him . For a man of forty-five to be worsted by a boy of fourteen was , it must be confessed , a little mortifying . It was something like a great ship of the line being compelled to surrender to a little monitor .  No one feels particularly dignified or good-natured when he is picking himself out of a mud puddle . Our black-haired acquaintance proved no exception to this remark . He shook his fist at the receding wagon and its occupant--a demonstration of defiance which our hero did not witness , his back being now turned to his late opponent .  Mr . Abner Holden--for this was the strangers name--next turned his attention to the buggy , which had been damaged to some extent , and so was likely to involve him in expense . This was another uncomfortable reflection . Meanwhile , as it was no longer in a fit state for travel , he must contrive some way to have it carried back to the stable , and , unless he could procure another vehicle , perform the rest of the journey on foot .  Luckily , some men in a neighboring field had witnessed the collision , and , supposing their services might be required , were now present to lend their aid .  Pretty bad accident , remarked one of them . That ere wheelll need considerable tinkering afore its fit for use . How came you to get it broke so , squire ?  A little rascal had the impudence to dispute the road with me , and would not turn out at my bidding , said Mr . Holden , in a tone of exasperation , which showed that his temper had been considerably soured by the accident .  Wouldnt turn out ? Seems to me from the marks of the wheels , you must have been drivin along in the middle of the road . I guess you didnt take the trouble to turn out , yourself .  Well , there was room enough for the boy to turn out one side , said Holden , doggedly .  You are slightly mistaken , stranger , said the other , who was disgusted at the travelers unreasonableness . There wasnt room; as anyone can see thats got eyes in his head . Didnt the youngster turn out at all ?  Yes , snapped Holden , not relishing the others free speech .  Then it seems you were the one that would not turn out . If you had been a leetle more accommodating , this accident couldnt have happened . Fair plays my motto . If a feller meets you halfway , its all you have a right to expect . I reckon itll cost you a matter of ten dollars to get that ere buggy fixed .  Holden looked savagely at the broken wheel , but that didnt mend matters . He would have answered the countryman angrily , but , as he stood in need of assistance , this was not good policy .  What would you advise me to do about it ? he inquired .  You will have to leave the buggy where it is just now . Where did you get it ?  Over at the mill village .  Well , youd better lead the horse back--taint moren a mile or so--get another wagon , and tell em to send for this .  Well , perhaps that is the best way .  Where was you goin ?  Over to Waverley .  Thats where the boy came from .  What boy ?  The boy that upset you .  What is his name ? asked Abner Holden , scowling .  His name is Herbert Mason , son of the Widder Mason that died two or three weeks since . Poor boy , hes left alone in the world .  Wheres he stopping ? asked Holden , hardly knowing why he asked the question .  Dr . Kent took him in after the funeral , so I heard; but the selectmen of Waverley are trying to find him a place somewheres , where he can earn his own livin . Hes a smart , capable boy , and I guess he can do most a mans work .  Abner Holden looked thoughtful . Some plan had suggested itself to him which appeared to yield him satisfaction , for he began to look decidedly more comfortable , and he muttered to himself: Ill be even with him YET . See if I dont .  How far am I from Waverley ? he asked , after a slight pause .  Well , risin three miles , drawled the other .  If I could get somebody to go back with this horse , I dont know but what Id walk to Waverley . Are you very busy ?  Well , I dont know but I could leave off for a short time , said the other , cautiously . Works pretty drivin , to be sure . What do you callate to pay ?  How much would it be worth ?  Well , theres the walk there and back , and then again theres the time .  You can mount the horse going .  I guess fifty centsll about pay me .  Mr . Holden took out his pocketbook and paid the required sum .  By the way , he said , as if incidentally , who is the chairman of the selectmen in the village of Waverley ?  You aint thinkin of takin that boy , be you ? said the other , curiously .  Ive had enough to do with him; I dont want ever to lay eyes on him again .  Well , I dunno as I should , if I was you , said the countryman , rather slyly .  You havent answered my question yet , said Holden , impatiently .  Oh , about the cheerman of the selectmen . Its Captain Joseph Ross .  Where does he live ?  A leetle this side of the village . Youll know the house , well enough . Its a large , square house painted white , with a well-sweep in front .  Without a word of thanks for the information , Abner Holden turned , and began to walk toward Waverley . Perhaps his object in making these inquiries has been guessed . It happened that he needed a boy , and , for more reasons than one , he thought he should like to have Herbert bound to him . Herbert , as he had noticed , was a stout boy , and he probably could get a good deal of work out of him . Then , again , it would be gratifying to him to have our hero in subjection to him . He could pay him off then , ten times over , for his insolence , as he chose to term it .  Ill break his proud spirit , thought Abner Holden . Hell find hes got a master , if I get hold of him . He dont know me yet , but he will some time .  Mr . Holden resolved to wait on Captain Ross at once , and conclude arrangements with him to take Herbert before our hero had returned from the mill village . He pictured , with a grim smile , Herberts dismay when he learned who was to be his future master .  With the help of a handkerchief dipped into a crystal stream at the roadside , Abner Holden succeeded in effacing some of the muddy stains upon his coat and pantaloons , and at length got himself into presentable trim for calling upon a selectman .  At length he came in sight of the house which had been described to him as that of Captain Ross . There was a woman at the well-sweep engaged in drawing water .  Does Captain Ross live here ? he inquired .  Yes , sir .  Is he at home ?  Hes over in the three-acre lot . Was you wantin to see him ?  I should like to . Is the field far away ?  No , its just behind the house .  Then I guess Ill go and find him . I want to see him on a little matter of business .  Mr . Holden crossed a mowing-field , and then , climbing over a stone wall , found himself at the edge of the three-acre lot . The captain was superintending one or two hired men , and , as he had his coat off , had probably been assisting them .  Captain Ross ? said Abner Holden , interrogatively .  Thats my name .  You are chairman of the selectmen , I believe ?  Yes , sir .  I understand that you have a boy that you want to bind out .  I reckon you mean Herbert Mason .  Yes , I believe thats the name I heard .  Are you in want of a boy ?  Yes , I am looking out for one .  What is your business ?  I keep a store , but I should want him to work on land part of the time .  Do you live hereabouts ?  Over at Cranston .  If youll come to the house , well talk the matter over . The boys a good boy , and we want to get a good place for him . His mother was a widder , and hes her only son . Hes a smart , capable lad , and good to work .  Ive no doubt hell suit me . Ill take him on your recommendation .  We should want him to go to school winters . Hes a pretty good scholar already . His father was a larned man , and used to teach him before he died . If he had lived , I reckon Herbert would certainly have gone to college .  Ill agree to send him to school in the winter for the next two years , said Holden , and will give him board and clothes , and when hes twenty-one a freedom suit , and a hundred dollars . Will that do ?  I dont know but thats reasonable , said Captain Ross , slowly . The boys a bit high-spirited , but if you manage him right , I guess youll like him .  Ill manage him! thought Abner Holden . Can I take him with me to-morrow ? he asked . I dont come this way very often .  Well , I guess that can be arranged . Well go over to Dr . Kents after dinner , and see if they can get him ready .  In the meantime , said Holden , afraid that the prize might slip through his fingers , suppose we make out the papers . I suppose you have full authority in the matter .  Captain Ross had no objection , and thus poor Herbert was unconsciously delivered over to the tender mercies of a man who had very little love for him .     CHAPTER IV  A DISAGREEABLE SURPRISE   After his collision with the traveler , Herbert hurried on to the mill , intent upon making up for lost time . He was satisfied with having successfully maintained his rights; and , as he had no reason to suppose he should ever again see his unreasonable opponent , dismissed him from his thoughts .  On reaching the mill , he found he should have to remain an hour or two before he could have his grain ground . He was not sorry for this , as it would give him an opportunity to walk around the village .  I wish , he thought , I could get a place in one of the stores here . Theres more going on than there is in Waverley , and I could go over Sundays to see Dr . Kents family .  On the spur of the moment , he resolved to inquire if some of the storekeepers did not require help . There was a large dry-goods store--the largest in the village--kept by Beckford & Keyes . He entered and inquired for the senior partner .  Mr . Beckford is not in , said the clerk . Mr . Keyes is standing at that desk .  Herbert went up to the desk , and said inquiringly , Mr . Keyes ?  That is my name , said that gentleman , pleasantly . Is there anything I can do for you ?  I am in search of a place , said our hero , and I thought you might have a vacancy here .  We have none just at present , said Mr . Keyes , who was favorably impressed by Herberts appearance; but it is possible we may have in a few weeks . Where do you live ? Not in the village , I suppose ?  No , sir , said Herbert , and a shadow passed over his face , My mother died three weeks since , and I am now stopping at the house of Dr . Kent .  Dr . Kent--ah , yes , I know the doctor . He is an excellent man .  He is , said Herbert , warmly . He has been very kind to me .  What is your name ?  Herbert Mason .  Then , Herbert , I will promise to bear you in mind . I will note down your name and address , and as soon as we have a vacancy I will write to you . Come into the store whenever you come this way .  Thank you , said Herbert .  He left the store feeling quite encouraged . Even if the chance never amounted to anything , the kind words and manner of the storekeeper gave him courage to hope that he would meet with equal kindness from others . Kind words cost nothing , but they have a marvelous power in lightening the burdens of the sorrowful and cheering the desponding .  Herbert left the store , feeling that he should consider himself truly fortunate if he could obtain a place in such an establishment . But there was a rough experience before him , of which at present he guessed nothing .  After sauntering about the village a little longer , and buying a stick of candy for little Mary Kent , the doctors only daughter , who was quite attached to Herbert , our hero got back to the mill in time to receive his bags of meal , with which he was soon on his way homeward .  About the place where he met Mr . Holden he was hailed by a man at work in the field--the same who had taken back that gentlemans horse to the stable .  Well , boy , you had a kind of scrimmage , didnt you , coming over ?  Did you see it ? asked Herbert .  Yes , said the other , grinning . I seed the other feller in the mud puddle . He was considerably riled about it .  It was his own fault . I gave him half the road .  I know it; but theres some folks that want more than their share .  Was his buggy broken ? I dont know but I ought to have stopped to help him , but he had been so unreasonable that I didnt feel much like it .  His wheel got broken . I drawed the buggy into the bushes . There tis now . Itll cost him a matter of ten dollars to fix it .  Im sorry for that , said Herbert; but I cant see that I was to blame in the matter . If I had turned out as he wanted me to , I should have tipped over , and , as the wagon didnt belong to me , I didnt think it right to risk it .  Of course not . You wasnt called on to give in to such unreasonableness .  Where did the man go ?  He concluded to walk on to Waverley , and hired me to take the horse back to the stable . He wanted to know who you were .  Did he ?  Maybe hes goin to sue you for damages .  I dont believe hell get much if he does , laughed our hero . My property is where he cant get hold of it .  Ho! ho! laughed the other , understanding the joke .  After this conversation Herbert continued on his way , and , after delivering the grain , took his way across the fields to his temporary home . He entered by the back yard . Little Mary came running out to meet him .  Have oo come back , Herbert ? she said . Where have oo been ?  Been to buy Mary some candy , he said , lifting her up and kissing her .  Whose horse is that at the gate ? asked Herbert , as the doctors wife entered the room .  It belongs to Captain Ross , she said . He has come on business connected with you .  Connected with me! repeated Herbert , in surprise .  Yes , my dear boy , I am afraid we must make up our minds to lose you .  Has he found a place for me ? asked Herbert , in a tone of disappointment .  Yes , I believe he has bound you out to a man in Cranston .  I am sorry , said Herbert .  I shall be sorry to have you go , Herbert , but I thought you wanted to go .  So I do; but by waiting a few weeks I could probably get a place in Beckford & Keyes store , at the mill village .  What makes you think so ?  Herbert detailed his interview of the morning with the junior partner . Just at this moment the doctor entered the kitchen .  Have you told him ? he inquired , looking at his wife .  Yes , and he says that but for this he might probably have got a chance to go into Beckfords store at the mill village .  I am sorry for this . They are good men , and he would have been near us , while Cranston is forty miles away .  Who is the man that wants me ? asked Herbert .  A Mr . Holden . He is in the other room with Captain Ross . It was all arranged before they came . He wants you to go with him to-morrow morning .  So soon ? said Herbert , in dismay .  Yes . At first he wished you to set off with him this afternoon; but I told him decidedly you could not be ready .  Quite impossible , said Mrs . Kent . Some of Herberts clothes are in the wash , and I cant have them ready till evening .  You had better come into the other room , Herbert , said the doctor . I will introduce you to your new employer .  Herbert followed the doctor into the sitting-room . His first glance rested on Captain Ross , whom he knew . He went up and shook hands with him . Next he turned to Mr . Holden , and to his inexpressible astonishment , recognized his opponent of the morning .  Mr . Holden , Herbert , introduced the doctor . Mr . Holden , this is the boy we have been speaking of .  I have seen Mr . Holden before , said Herbert , coldly .  Yes , said Mr . Holden , writhing his disagreeable features into an unpleasant smile . We have met before .  Dr . Kent looked from one to the other in surprise , as if seeking an explanation .  Our acquaintance doesnt date very far back , said Mr . Holden . We met this morning between here and the mill village .  Indeed , said the doctor; you passed each other , I suppose .  Well , no; I cant say we did exactly , said Mr . Holden , with the same unpleasant smile , We tried to , but the road being narrow , there was a collision , and I came off second-best .  I hope there was no accident .  Oh , nothing to speak of . I got tipped out , and my clothes , as you may observe , suffered some . As for my young friend here , he rode on uninjured .  You must excuse my not stopping to inquire if I could help you , said Herbert; but my horse was frightened by the collision , and I could not easily stop him .  Oh , its of no consequence , said Mr . Holden , in an off-hand manner . He was determined not to show himself out in his true colors until he had got Herbert absolutely under his control .  But where is your horse , Mr . Holden ? asked Captain Ross . I think you were walking when you came to my house .  I sent it back to the village by a man I met on the road , my buggy being disabled .  Your carriage wasnt much injured , I hope .  Oh , no , not much .  I dont see exactly how it could happen , said Captain Ross . I thought the road from here to the mill village was broad enough at any point for carriages to pass each other .  I didnt dream , said Mr . Holden , not noticing this remark , that the young man I had engaged was my young acquaintance of the morning .  Herbert looked at him , puzzled by his entire change of manner--a change so sudden that he suspected its genuineness .  The more he thought of it , the more unwilling he felt to live with Mr . Holden . But could it be avoided ? He resolved to try . He accordingly told the doctor and Captain Ross of the promise that Mr . Keyes had made him .  It would be a good place , said the captain; but it aint certain . Now , heres Mr . Holden , ready to take you at once .  If I was in the mill village I could come over and see my friends here now and then . Besides , I think I should like being in a store .  Oh , Ive got a store , too , said Mr . Holden , and I should expect you to tend there part of the time . I dont think I can let you off , my young friend , he added , with a disagreeable smile . I think we shall get along very well together .  Herbert did not feel at all sure of this , but he saw that it would do no good to remonstrate farther , and kept silence . Soon after , Mr . Holden and Captain Ross rose to go .  Ill call round for my young friend about nine to-morrow morning , said Abner Holden , with an ingratiating smile .  We will endeavor to have him ready , said the doctor .  After they went away Herbert wandered about in not the best of spirits . He was convinced that he should not be happy with Mr . Holden , against whom he had conceived an aversion , founded partly upon the occurrences of the morning , and partly on the disagreeable impression made upon him by Abner Holdens personal appearance .     CHAPTER V  THE ENVELOPE   Herbert woke up early the next morning , and a feeling of sadness came over him as he reflected that it was his last morning in Waverley . He was going out into the world , and , as he could not help thinking , under very unfavorable auspices . New scenes and new experiences usually have a charm for a boy , but Mr . Holdens disagreeable face and unpleasant smile rose before him , and the prospect seemed far from tempting .  When he came downstairs , he found Mrs . Kent in the kitchen .  You are up early , Mrs . Kent , said Herbert .  Yes , Herbert; I want you to have a good breakfast before you go .  It certainly was a nice breakfast . Tender beefsteak , warm biscuit , golden butter , potatoes fried crisp and brown , and excellent coffee , might have tempted any appetite . Herbert , in spite of his sadness , did full justice to the bountiful meal .  The family had hardly risen from breakfast when the sound of wheels was heard outside , and directly there was a knock at the door .  Its Mr . Holden , said the doctor , looking from the front window .  Must we part from you so soon , Herbert ? said Mrs . Kent , affectionately .  Where oo goin , Herbert ? asked little Mary , clinging to his knee ,  Herberts going away , Mary , said he , stooping and kissing his little friend .  Herbert mustnt go way , said the little girl , in discontent .  Herbert come back soon , and bring candy for Mary , he said , wishing that his words might come true .  By that time Mr . Holden had entered , and was surveying the scene with his disagreeable smile .  Little Mary is quite attached to Herbert , said the doctor .  I am sorry , said Mr . Holden , that I have no little girls , as Herbert seems fond of them .  Herbert doubted if he could become attached to anyone related to Mr . Holden .  Im a bachelor , said Mr . Holden , though perhaps I ought to be ashamed to say so . If I had had the good fortune early in life to encounter a lady like your good wife here , it might have been different .  It isnt too late yet , Mr . Holden , said the doctor .  Well , perhaps not . If Mrs . Kent is ever a widow , I may try my luck .  What a disagreeable man , thought the doctors wife , not propitiated by the compliment . Herbert , she said , here are a couple of handkerchiefs I bought in the village yesterday . I hope you will find them useful .  Yes; no doubt he will , said Mr . Holden , laughing . He will think of you whenever he has a bad cold .  Nobody even smiled at this witty sally , and , Mr . Holden , a little disappointed , remarked: Well , times getting on . I guess we must be going , as we have a long journey before us .  The whole family accompanied Herbert to the road . After kissing Mary and Mrs . Kent , and shaking the doctor cordially by the hand , Herbert jumped into the wagon . Just before the horse started the doctor handed our hero a sealed envelope , saying , You can open it after a while .  Though , like most boys of his age , Herbert had a great horror of making a baby of himself , he could hardly help crying as he rode up the street , and felt that he had parted from his best friends . His eyes filled with tears , which he quietly wiped away with the corner of his handkerchief .  Come , come , dont blubber , boy , said Mr . Holden , coarsely .  Herbert was not weak enough to melt into tears at an unkind word . It roused his indignation , and he answered , shortly , When you see me blubbering , itll be time enough to speak , Mr . Holden .  It looked a good deal like it , at any rate , said Abner . However , Im glad if Im mistaken . Theres nothing to cry about that I can see .  No , perhaps not , said Herbert; but theres something to be sorry for .  Something to be sorry for , is there ? said Abner Holden .  Yes .  Well , what is it ?  Ive left my best friends , and I dont know when I shall see them again .  Nor I , said Mr . Holden . But I think its high time you left them .  Why ? asked Herbert , indignantly .  Because they were petting you and making too much of you . You wont get such treatment as that from me .  I dont expect it , said our hero .  Thats lucky , said Abner Holden , dryly . Its well that people shouldnt expect what they are not likely to get .  Here a sense of the ludicrous came over Herbert as he thought of being Mr . Holdens pet , and he laughed heartily . Not understanding the reason of his sudden mirth , that gentleman demanded , in a tone of irritation , What are you making a fool of yourself about ?  What am I laughing at ? said Herbert , not liking the form of the question .  Yes , snarled Abner .  The idea of being your pet , explained Herbert , frankly .  Mr . Holden did not appreciate the joke , and said roughly , You better shut up , if you know whats best for yourself .  They rode along in silence for a few minutes . Then Abner Holden , thinking suddenly of the envelope which Dr . Kent had placed in Herberts hand at parting , and feeling curious as to its contents , asked:  What did the doctor give you just as you were starting ?  It was an envelope .  I know that; but what was there in it ?  I havent looked , said our hero .  He felt a little satisfaction in snubbing Mr . Holden , whom he saw he would never like .  Why dont you open it ?  I didnt think of it before .  I suppose there is some present inside .  Herbert decided to open the envelope , out of respect for Dr . Kent . On opening it , he drew out a five-dollar bill , and a few penciled words , which were as follows:  DEAR HERBERT: I would gladly give you more if I had the means . I hope you will use the inclosed money in any way that may be most serviceable to you . You must write to me often . Be a good boy , as you always have been; let your aims be noble; try to do right at all hazards , and may God bless your efforts , and make you a good and true man . Such is the prayer of your affectionate friend , GEORGE KENT .  Herbert read these lines with emotion , and inwardly resolved that he would try to carry out the recommendations laid down . His thoughts were broken in upon by Mr . Holden , whose sharp eyes detected the bank-note .  Theres money in the letter , isnt there ?  Yes .  How much ?  Five dollars .  Five dollars , hey ? he said . Youd better give it to me to keep for you .  Thank you , Mr . Holden; I can take care of it , myself .  It isnt a good plan for boys to have so large a sum of money in their possession , said Abner Holden , who was anxious to secure it himself .  Why not ? asked Herbert .  Because they are likely to spend it improperly .  Dr . Kent didnt seem to think I was likely to do that .  No; he trusted you too much .  I hope it wont prove so .  Youd better keep out of the way of temptation . You might lose it , besides .  I dont often lose things .  Come , boy , said Mr . Holden , getting impatient; Dr . Kent , no doubt , intended that I should take care of the money for you . Youd better give it up without further trouble .  Why didnt he give it to you , then ? demanded Herbert .  He supposed you would give it to me .  Mr . Holdens motive for getting the money into his own hands was twofold . First , he knew that without money Herbert would be more helpless and more in his power . Secondly , as he had agreed to supply Herbert with clothing , he thought he might appropriate the money towards this purpose , and it would be so much of a saving to his own pocket . Perhaps Herbert suspected some such design . At any rate , he had no intention of gratifying Mr . Holden by giving up the money .  Well , are you going to give me the money ? blustered Abner Holden , taking out his pocketbook , ready to receive it .  No , said Herbert .  Youll repent this conduct , young man , said Holden , scowling .  I dont think I shall , said our hero . I dont understand why you are so anxious to get hold of the money .  It is for your good , said Abner .  Id rather keep it , said Herbert .  Abner Holden hardly knew what to do . The money was by this time safely stowed away in Herberts pocket , where he could not very well get at it . However , he had a plan for getting it which he resolved to put into practice when they stopped for dinner .     CHAPTER VI  ON THE WAY   By the time they had ridden twenty miles both Herbert and Mr . Holden felt hungry . The fresh air had produced a similar effect upon both . They approached a broad , low building with a swinging sign and a long piazza in front , which it was easy to see was a country tavern .  Do you feel hungry , boy ? inquired Abner Holden .  Yes , sir , returned our hero .  So do I . I think I shall get some dinner here . You can get some , too , if you like .  Thank you , sir .  Oh , theres no occasion to thank me , said Mr . Holden , dryly . I shall pay for my dinner , and if you want any , you can pay for yours .  Herbert looked surprised . As he had entered Mr . Holdens employ , he supposed of course that the latter would feel bound to provide for him , and it certainly seemed mean that he should be compelled to pay for his own dinner . However , he was beginning to suspect that his new employer was essentially a mean man .  How much will it cost ? asked Herbert , at length .  Thirty-seven cents , was the reply .  It must be remembered that this was in the day of low prices , when gold was at par , and board could be obtained at first-class city hotels for two dollars and a half a day , and in country villages at that amount by the week .  Thirty-seven cents! Herbert hardly liked to break in upon his scanty hoard , but the morning air had sharpened his appetite , and he felt that he must have something to eat . Besides , he remembered one thing which fortunately Mr . Holden did not know , that in addition to the five dollars which Dr . Kent had given him he had the ten dollars sent him by his uncle , and not only that , but a little loose change which he had earned .  Well , are you going to get out ? asked Abner Holden . Its nothing to me whether you take dinner or not .  Yes , I guess I will .  Very well , said Holden , who had a reason for being pleased with his decision .  Both went into the tavern . There were two or three loungers on a settle , who gazed at them curiously . One of them at once appeared to recognize Abner Holden .  How dy do , Holden ? he said . Whove you got with you ?  A boy Ive taken , said Holden , shortly .  A pretty smart-looking boy . Whered you pick him up ?  Over in Waverley . Hes got some pretty high notions , but I guess Ill take em out of him in time .  Yes , chuckled the other; I warrant you will .  While this conversation was going on Herbert had entered the tavern , but he could not avoid hearing what was said , including Mr . Holdens reply . He was not frightened , but inwardly determined that he would do his duty , and then if Mr . Holden saw fit to impose upon him , he would make what resistance he was able .  I wonder what high notions he means , thought our hero . If he expects to make a slave of me , he will be mistaken , thats all .  Sit down there , and Ill go and order dinner , said Mr . Holden , entering .  Just then , however , the landlord came in and greeted Abner Holden , whom he appeared to know .  I want dinner for two , Mr . Robinson , he said .  For two! You havent brought your wife along with you , Holden ? he said , jocosely .  No , I havent come across any such lady yet . Ive got a boy here who is bound to me . And hark you , landlord , he added , in a lower voice , that Herbert might not hear , he will pay you for his dinner out of a five-dollar bill which he has with him . YOU NEEDNT GIVE BACK THE CHANGE TO HIM , BUT TO ME .  Yes , I understand , said the landlord , winking .  I prefer to keep the money for him . He has refused to give it up and this will give me a chance to get hold of it without any fuss .  All right .  If he kept it himself hed spend it in some improper way .  Just so . Ill attend to it .  Now our hero was gifted with pretty sharp ears , and he caught enough of this conversation to understand Mr . Holdens plot , which he straightway determined should not succeed .  You shant take me in this time , Mr . Holden , he thought .  He opened his pocketbook to see if he had enough small change to pay for his dinner without intrenching upon his bill . There proved to be a quarter and two half-dimes , amounting , of course , to thirty-five cents . This would not be quite sufficient .  I must change the bill somewhere , he said to himself .  Looking out of the tavern window , he saw the village store nearly opposite . He took his cap and ran over . There was a clerk leaning with his elbows upon the counter , appearing unoccupied .  It occurred to Herbert that he might want some paper and envelopes . He inquired the price .  We sell the paper at a penny a sheet , and the envelopes will cost you eight cents a package .  Then you may give me twelve sheets of paper and a package of envelopes , said Herbert .  The package was done up for him and in payment he tendered the bill .  The clerk gave him back four dollars and eighty cents in change . He put the money in his pocketbook , and the paper and envelopes in his jacket-pocket , and returned to the tavern well pleased with his success . Mr . Holden was in the barroom , taking a glass of bitters , and had not noticed the absence of our hero .  Dinner was soon ready .  There was some beefsteak and coffee and a whole apple pie . Herbert surveyed the viands with satisfaction , having a decidedly good appetite . He soon found , however , that hungry as he was , he stood a poor chance with Abner Holden; that gentleman , being a very rapid eater , managed to appropriate two-thirds of the beefsteak and three-quarters of the pie . However , the supply being abundant , Herbert succeeded in making a satisfactory repast , and did not grudge the amount which he knew he should have to pay for it before leaving .  Now , said Abner Holden , his eyes twinkling at the thought of our heros coming discomfiture , well go and settle our bill .  Very well , said Herbert , quietly .  They entered the public room and advanced to the bar .  This boy wants to pay for his dinner , Mr . Robinson , said Abner , significantly .  How much will it be ? asked Herbert .  Thirty-seven cents .  Herbert took out of his vest pocket a quarter , a dime and two cents , and handed them over .  To say that Abner Holden looked amazed is not sufficient . He looked disgusted and wronged , and glared at Herbert as if to inquire how he could have the face to outrage his feelings in that way .  Ho! ho! laughed the landlord , who , having no interest in the matter , was amused at the course affairs had taken .  Herbert suppressed his desire to laugh , and looked as if he had no knowledge of Mr . Holdens plans .  Where did you get that money ? growled Abner , with a scowl .  Out of my vest pocket , said Herbert , innocently .  I know that , of course , but I thought you had only a bill .  Oh , I got that changed at the store .  How dared you go over there without my permission ? roared Abner .  I didnt think it necessary to ask your permission to go across the street .  Well , you know it now . Dont you go there again without my knowledge .  Very well , sir .  Did you buy anything at the store ? continued Mr . Holden .  Yes , sir .  What was it ?  Some paper and envelopes .  Humph! muttered Abner , discontentedly .  He proceeded to pay his own bill and in a few minutes got into the wagon and drove off rather sulkily . Herbert saw that Mr . Holden was disturbed by the failure of his little plan , and felt amused rather than otherwise . But when he reflected that he was going to live with this man , and be , to a considerable extent under his control , he felt inclined to be sad . One thing he resolved that he would not submit to tyranny . The world was wide , and he felt able to earn his own living . He would give Mr . Holden a trial , and if he treated him with reasonable fairness he would remain with him . But he was not going to be any mans slave .  Meanwhile they were getting over the road , and a few more hours brought them to their journeys end .  Abner Holdens house stood in considerable need of paint . It had no great pretensions to architectural beauty , being about as handsome for a house as Abner Holden was for a man . There was a dilapidated barn , a little to one side , and the yard was littered up with a broken wagon , a woodpile and various odds and ends , giving the whole a very untidy look .  Is this where you live , Mr . Holden ? asked Herbert , looking about him .  Yes , and Im glad to get home . Do you know how to unharness a horse ?  Yes , sir .  Then jump out and unharness this horse . A man will come for it to-morrow .  Herbert did as directed . Then he took his little trunk from the wagon , and went with it to the back door and knocked .     CHAPTER VII  A NEW HOME   The door was opened by an elderly woman , rather stout , who acted as Abner Holdens housekeeper . Though decidedly homely , she had a pleasant look , which impressed Herbert favorably . He had feared she might turn out another edition of Mr . Holden , and with two such persons he felt that it would be difficult to get along .  Come right in , said Mrs . Bickford , for that was her name . Let me help you with your trunk . You can set it down here for the present .  Thank you , said Herbert .  You must be tired , said the housekeeper .  No , not very , said our hero . We rode all the way .  Well , its tiresome riding , at any rate , when its such a long distance . You came from Waverley , Mr . Holden tells me .  Yes .  And that is more than thirty miles away , isnt it ?  Yes , I believe so .  So youve come to help Mr . Holden ? she added , after a pause .  Yes , I suppose so , said Herbert , rather seriously .  What is your name ?  Herbert Mason .  I hope , Herbert , we shall be able to make you comfortable .  Thank you , said Herbert , a little more cheerful , as he perceived that he was to have one friend in Mr . Holdens household .  Has Mr . Holden generally kept a boy ? he asked .  Yes , he calculates to keep one most of the time .  Who was the last one ?  His name was Frank Miles .  Was he here long ? asked Herbert , in some curiosity .  Well , no , said the housekeeper , he did not stay very long .  How long ?  He was here most a month .  Most a month ? Didnt he like it ?  Well , no; he didnt seem to like Mr . Holden much .  Herbert was not much surprised to hear this . He would have thought Frank Miles a singular sort of a boy if he had liked Abner Holden .  Have any of the boys that have been here liked Mr . Holden ? he asked .  I cant say as they have , said Mrs . Bickford , frankly; and somehow they dont seem to stay long .  Why didnt they like him ?  Sh! said the housekeeper , warningly .  Herbert looked round and saw his employer entering the room .  Well , boy , have you put up the horse ? he asked , abruptly .  Yes sir .  Did you give him some hay ?  Yes , sir .  And some grain ?  No , I didnt know where it was kept . If youll tell me , Ill do it now .  No , you neednt . He isnt to have any . Hes only a hired horse .  Considering that the hired horse had traveled over thirty miles , Herbert thought he was entitled to some oats; but Mr . Holden was a mean man , and decided otherwise .  Where is Herbert to sleep , Mr . Holden ? asked the housekeeper .  Up garret .  Theres a small corner bedroom in the second story , suggested Mrs . Bickford , who knew that the garret was not very desirable .  I guess he wont be too proud to sleep in the garret , said Mr . Holden . Shall you ? he continued , turning to Herbert .  Put me where you please , said Herbert , coldly .  Then it shall be the garret . You can take your trunk up now . Mrs . Bickford will show you the way .  Its too heavy for you , Herbert , said the housekeeper; I will help you .  Oh , he can carry it alone , said Abner Holden . He isnt a baby .  Id rather help him , said the housekeeper , taking one handle of the trunk . You go first , Herbert , Youre young and spry , and can go faster than I .  On the second landing Herbert saw the little bedroom in which the housekeeper wanted to put him . It was plainly furnished , but it was light and cheerful , and he was sorry he was not to have it .  You could have had that bedroom just as well as not , said Mrs . Bickford . Its never used . But Mr . Holdens rather contrary , and as hard to turn as a--  A mule ? suggested Herbert , laughing .  Its pretty much so , said the housekeeper , joining in the laugh .  They went up a narrow staircase and emerged into a dark garret , running the whole length of the house without a partition . The beams and rafters were visible , for the sloping sides were not plastered . Herbert felt that he might as well have been in the barn , except that there was a small cot bedstead in the center of the floor .  It isnt very pleasant , said the housekeeper .  No , said Herbert , I dont think it is .  I declare , its too bad you should have to sleep here . Mr . Holden isnt very considerate .  I guess I can stand it , said our hero , though I should rather be downstairs .  Ill bring up the trap and set it before you go to bed , said Mrs . Bickford .  The trap! repeated Herbert , in surprise .  Yes , theres rats about , and I suppose youd rather have a trap than a cat .  Yes; the cat would be about as bad as the rats .  At this moment Abner Holdens voice was heard at the bottom of the stairs , and Mrs . Bickford hurried down , followed by our hero .  I thought you were going to stay up there all day , said Mr . Holden . What were you about up there ?  That is my business , said Mrs . Bickford , shortly .  The housekeeper was independent in her feelings , and , knowing that she could readily obtain another situation , did not choose to be browbeaten by Mr . Holden . He was quite aware of her value , and the difficulty he would experience in supplying her place , and he put some constraint over himself in the effort not to be rude to her . With Herbert , however , it was different . HE was BOUND to him , and therefore in his power . Abner Holden exulted in this knowledge , and with the instinct of a petty tyrant determined to let Herbert realize his dependence .  You may go out and saw some wood , he said . Youll find the saw in the woodshed .  What wood shall I saw ?  The wood in the woodpile , stupid .  Very well , sir , said our hero , quietly .  Herbert thought Mr . Holden was losing no time in setting him to work . However , he had resolved to do his duty , unpleasant as it might be , as long as Abner Holden only exacted what was reasonable , and Herbert was aware that he had a right to require him to go to work at once . Mrs . Bickford , however , said a word in his favor .  Ive got wood enough to last till to-morrow , Mr . Holden , she said .  Well , what of it ?  Its likely the boy is tired .  Whats he done to make him tired , I should like to know ? Ridden thirty miles , and eaten a good dinner!  Which I paid for myself , said Herbert .  What if you did ? said Abner Holden , turning to him . I suppose youll eat supper at my expense , and youd better do something , first , to earn it .  That I am willing to do .  Then go out to the woodpile without any more palavering .  Mr . Holden , said the housekeeper , seriously , after Herbert had gone out , if you want to keep that boy , I think you had better be careful how you treat him .  Why do you say that ? demanded Abner , eying her sharply . Has he been saying anything to you about me ?  No .  Then why did you say that ?  Because I can see what kind of a boy he is .  Well , what kind of a boy is he ? asked Abner , with a sneer .  He is high-spirited , and will work faithfully if hes treated well , but he wont allow himself to be imposed upon .  How do you know that ?  I can read it in his face . I have had some experience with boys , and you may depend upon it that I am not mistaken .  He had better do his duty , blustered Abner , if he knows whats best for himself .  He will do his duty , said the housekeeper , firmly , but there is a duty which you owe to him , as well as he to you .  Dont I always do my duty by boys , Mrs . Bickford ?  No , Mr . Holden , I dont think you do . You know very well you can never get a boy to stay with you .  This boy is bound to me , Mrs . Bickford--legally bound .  That may be; but if you dont treat him as he ought to be treated , he will run away , take my word for it .  If he does , hell be brought back , take my word for that , Mrs . Bickford . I shall treat him as I think he deserves , but as to petting and pampering the young rascal I shall do nothing of the kind .  I dont think you will , said the housekeeper . However , Ive warned you .  You seem to take a good deal of interest in the boy , said Abner , sneeringly .  Yes , I do .  After half an hours acquaintance .  Ive known him long enough to see that hes better than the common run of boys , and I hope that hell stay .  Theres no doubt about that , said Abner Holden , significantly . Hell have to stay , whether he wants to or not .     CHAPTER VIII  THE GHOST IN THE ATTIC   After working two hours at the woodpile , Herbert was called in to tea . There was no great variety , Abner Holden not being a bountiful provider . But the bread was sweet and good , and the gingerbread fresh . Herberts two hours of labor had given him a hearty appetite , and he made a good meal . Mrs . Bickford looked on approvingly . She was glad to see that our hero enjoyed his supper .  There was tea on the table , and , after pouring out a cup for Mr . Holden , the housekeeper was about to pour out one for Herbert .  He dont want any tea , said Abner , noticing the action . Keep the cup for yourself , Mrs . Bickford .  What do you mean , Mr . Holden ? asked the housekeeper , in surprise .  Tea isnt good for a growing boy . A glass of cold water will be best for him .  I dont agree with you , Mr . Holden , said the housekeeper , decidedly . Herbert has been hard at work , and needs his tea as much as you or I do .  Therefore , without waiting for his permission , she handed the cup to Herbert , who proceeded to taste it .  Abner Holden frowned , but neither Herbert nor the housekeeper took much notice of it . The latter was somewhat surprised at this new freak on the part of Abner , as he had never tried to deprive any of Herberts predecessors of tea or coffee . But the fact was , Mr . Holden disliked Herbert , and was disposed to act the petty tyrant over him . He had neither forgotten nor forgiven the boys spirited defiance when they first met , nor his refusal to surrender into his hands the five dollars which the doctor had given him .  Feeling tired by eight oclock , Herbert went up to his garret room and undressed himself . An instinct of caution led him to take out the money in his porte-monnaie , and put it in his trunk , which he then locked , and put the key under the sheet , so that no one could get hold of it without awakening him . This precaution proved to be well taken .  Herbert lay down upon the bed , but did not immediately go to sleep . He could not help thinking of his new home , and the new circumstances in which he was placed . He did not feel very well contented , and felt convinced from what he had already seen of Mr . Holden , that he should never like him . Then thoughts of his mother , and of her constant and tender love , and the kind face he would never more see on earth , swept over him , and almost unmanned him . To have had her still alive he would have been content to live on dry bread and water .  He thought , too , of the doctors family and their kindness . How different it would have been if he might have continued to find a home with them! But when he was tempted to repine , the thought of his mothers Christian instructions came to him , and he was comforted by the reflection , that whatever happened to him was with the knowledge of his Father in heaven , who would not try him above his strength .  Try and trust! That was almost the last advice his mother had given him , as the surest way of winning the best success .  Yes , he thought , I will try and trust , and leave the rest with God .  Meanwhile Mr . Holden had not been able to keep out of his head the five dollars which he knew Herbert possessed . He was a mean man , and wished to appropriate it to his own use . Besides this , he was a stubborn man , and our heros resistance only made him the more determined to triumph over his opposition by fair means or foul . It struck him that it would be a good idea to take advantage of our heros slumber , and take the money quietly from his pocketbook while he was unconscious .  Accordingly , about eleven oclock , he went softly up the attic stairs with a candle in his hand , and , with noiseless steps , approached the bed . Herberts regular breathing assured him that he was asleep . Abner Holden took up his pants and felt for his pocketbook . He found it , and drew it out with exultation .  Aha! he thought; Ive got it .  But this brief exultation was succeeded by quick disappointment . The pocketbook proved to be quite empty .  Curse it! muttered Abner , what has the boy done with his money ?  It was at this moment that Herbert , his eyes possibly affected by the light , awoke , and he discovered his employer examining his pocketbook .  His first feeling was indignation , but the sight of Abner Holdens disappointed face amused him , and he determined not to reveal his wakefulness , but to watch , him quietly .  Perhaps hes got two pocketbooks , thought Abner . But in this he was mistaken .  Next he went to Herberts trunk , and tried it , but found it locked .  I wonder where he keeps the key , was his next thought .  He searched Herberts pockets , but the search was in vain .  Plague take the young rascal! he muttered , loud enough for Herbert to hear .  Herbert turned in bed , and Abner Holden , fearing that he might wake up , and being on the whole , rather ashamed of his errand , and unwilling to be caught in it , went downstairs .  Well , he didnt make much , thought our hero . Its lucky I thought to put the money in my trunk . If he only knew I had fifteen dollars , instead of five , he would be all the more anxious to get hold of it .  How did you sleep last night , Herbert ? inquired the housekeeper at breakfast .  Very well , thank you , Mrs . Bickford .  He was resolved not to drop a hint of what had happened , being curious to see if Mr . Holden would make any further attempts to obtain his money . As his employer might possibly find a key that would unlock the trunk , he thought it prudent , during the day , to carry the money about with him .  He hardly knew whether to expect a visit from Abner the next night , but formed a little plan for frightening him if such a visit should take place .  It so happened that he had in his trunk a fish horn which had been given him by someone in Waverley . This he took out of the trunk before retiring and hid it under his pillow . It was about nine oclock when he went to bed , but by considerable effort he succeeded in keeping awake for an hour or two .  About eleven oclock , Abner Holden , before going to bed himself , decided to make one more attempt to obtain possession of Herberts money . He reflected that possibly our hero had only put away his money by chance on the previous evening , and might have neglected to do so on the present occasion . He desired to get possession of it before any part of it was spent , as , judging from what he knew of boys , it would not remain long unexpended .  Once more , therefore , he took his candle , and removing his thick-soled shoes , which might betray him by their sound , crept softly up the steep and narrow staircase .  But Herbert heard him , and moreover was warned of his visit by the light of the candle which he carried . He closed his eyes , and awaited his coming in silent expectation .  Abner Holden looked towards the bed . Herberts eyes were closed , and his breathing was deep and regular .  Hes sound asleep , thought Abner , with satisfaction .  He set down the candle on a chair beside the bed , and began to examine our heros pocketbook once more . But it proved to be empty as before . In the pocketbook , however , he found a key , the key , as he supposed , to Herberts trunk . It was not , however , being only a key which Herbert had picked up one day in the street , and kept . He had put it in his pocket with a view to mislead his employer .  That gentleman uttered a low exclamation of satisfaction when his fingers closed upon the key , never doubting for a moment that it would open the trunk .  Leaving the candle in its place , he rose from his recumbent position , threw the pants on the bed , and went round on the other side , to try the key .  He got down on his knees before the trunk , and had inserted the key in the lock , or rather had made an ineffectual attempt to do so , when suddenly the candle was extinguished , and a horrible blast on the fish horn resounded through the garret .  Now , Abner Holden was not a very courageous man . In fact , he was inclined to superstition . He knew that he was engaged in a dishonorable attempt to rob a boy who was placed in his charge , and there is an old proverb that says conscience makes cowards of us all . It must be admitted that it was rather calculated to affect the nerves to find ones self suddenly in the dark , and at the same time to hear such a fearful noise proceeding from an unknown quarter .  Abner Holden jumped to his feet in dire dismay , and , without stopping to reflect on the probable cause of this startling interruption , struck a bee line for the staircase , and descended quicker , probably , than he had ever done before , narrowly escaping tumbling the entire distance , in his headlong haste .  Herbert had to stuff the bedclothes into his mouth to keep from bursting into a shout of laughter , which would have revealed his agency in producing the mysterious noise .  I thought I heard a frightful noise last night soon after I went to bed , said Mrs . Bickford , at the breakfast table . Didnt you hear anything , Mr . Holden ?  No , said Abner , I heard nothing . You were probably dreaming .  Perhaps I was . Didnt you hear anything , Herbert ?  I sleep pretty sound , said Herbert , quietly .  Abner Holden watched him as he said this , and was evidently more perplexed than ever . But that was the last visit he paid to the garret at night .     CHAPTER IX  EXPOSING A FRAUD   It would be hard to tell what Abner Holdens precise occupation was . He had thirty or forty acres of land , but only cultivated enough to produce supplies of vegetables for his own table , and grain for his horses . He kept four cows , and he had , at this time , three horses . He had the Yankee propensity for swapping , and from time to time traded horses , generally managing to get the best of the bargain , for he was tolerably sharp and not much troubled by conscientious scruples about misstating the merits of his horses .  But , about two months before Herbert came into his employ , he had himself been overreached , and found himself the possessor of a horse of excellent outward appearance , but blind of one eye , and with a very vicious temper . He accepted the situation with a bad grace , and determined , as soon as possible , to trade the horse to another party .  One day , about a fortnight after Herberts arrival , a gentlemanly-looking stranger knocked at Abner Holdens door .  The call was answered by the housekeeper .  Is Mr . Holden at home ? he inquired .  Yes , sir , was the reply .  I should like to see him .  Abner Holden soon made his appearance .  Mr . Holden . said the stranger I am in search of a good family horse . I am told that you have some animals for sale , and called on you , thinking I might get suited through you .  Youve come to the right place , said Abner , glibly . Ive got just the animal that will suit you .  I should like to see it .  Hes in the pasture now . If you dont object to walking a short distance , I will show him to you . I feel sure he will suit you .  Very well , I will go with you .  This way , then .  The two walked down a green lane at the back of the house to the entrance of the pasture , where the three horses , at present comprising Abner Holdens entire stock , were grazing leisurely .  Now , it happened that , of the three , the blind and vicious horse was much the best looking . He held his head erect , had a graceful form , and was likely to attract favorable notice at first sight .  Abner Holden paused at a little distance , and pointed him out .  What do you think of that horse , Mr . Richmond ? he said .  A very good-looking animal , said the stranger , with an approving glance; but I must explain that I want such an animal as my wife can drive . It is absolutely necessary that he should be good-tempered and gentle . If , with this , he is handsome , and of good speed , all the better . Now you know what I am in search of . Can you recommend this horse of yours ?  Yes , said Abner , confidently , he will just suit you . I did calculate to keep him for my own use , but Im rather short of money , and I shall have to let him go .  You say he is gentle ?  Oh , yes , as gentle as need be .  Could a woman drive him ?  Oh , no trouble about that , said Abner .  And he has no serious defect ?  No .  Well , that seems satisfactory . I like his appearance . He would look well in harness . What is your price ?  Two hundred and fifty dollars , cash down , said Abner . Thats too cheap . Hes worth a cool hundred more , but I got him cheap , and can afford to sell him cheap .  The horse had cost Mr . Holden just a hundred and ten dollars , and at this price he considered himself decidedly taken in; but this he did not particularly care to mention .  Two hundred and fifty dollars! mused the stranger . It is a little more than I intended to pay . Still , if the animal is what you describe , I dont know that I shall object on that score .  You had better take him , said Abner . Itll be the best bargain you ever made , Ill warrant . Youll pay cash down , I suppose ?  Of course .  Then shall we say its a bargain ?  Not quite yet . Ill take till the afternoon to think about it .  Better decide now . The fact is , Mr . Richmond , I ought not to let the horse go at that figure , and I may change my mind .  I think I shall take your horse , but I have agreed to look at another , and must see that first .  Whose ?  It belongs to a man named Nichols .  Sam Nichols ?  I believe so .  I wouldnt advise you to have anything to do with him .  Why not ?  Hes a regular sharper . You cant depend on anything he says .  Thank you for the caution . I will be on my guard . But I promised to take a look at his horse before deciding . If I dont come to terms with him , and I dont think I shall , I will come round some time this afternoon and make a bargain with you .  Mr . Holden thought it was hardly politic to urge him farther . With a renewed caution as to dealing with Sam Nichols , he let him go .  Well , thought Abner , after he was gone , it will be a pretty good thing if I get rid of Spitfire--he had named him thus--for two hundred and fifty dollars . Hes a bad-tempered brute , and blind into the bargain . But Im not bound to tell Mr . Richmond that , and so spoil my trade . Ive put a flea in his ear about Nichols , and I guess he will be back again .  The prospect of making a good bargain caused Abner to be unusually pleasant and good-humored , so much so that Mrs . Bickford regarded him with surprise . He voluntarily asked her if she did not wish something at the store , volunteering to bring home whatever was needed .  Whats come over the man ? thought the housekeeper . Its too good to last .  She was quite correct there . Mr . Holden was naturally crabbed , and fair weather with him was the exception rather than the rule . On the present occasion it did not last many hours .  Abner Holden went to the store , but made other calls on the way , so that he was three hours absent , and did not return till twelve oclock , the usual dinner hour in his household .  Meanwhile , Mr . Richmond , his caller of the morning , had been to see Sam Nichols , and inspected the horse he had for sale . He did not altogether like its appearance , and , moreover , he was prejudiced against him by what he had heard from Abner Holden , and came away without effecting a purchase .  I dont think I can do better , he reflected , than to take that horse of Holdens . Let me see , it is only half-past ten . I shall have time to go up there this morning . I suppose I might as well settle matters at once .  Accordingly , eleven oclock found him again in Abner Holdens yard .  Herbert was out in the yard , engaged in splitting wood .  Is Mr . Holden at home ? inquired the stranger , pausing .  No , sir .  Will he be at home soon ?  Yes , sir , I think so . He only went out to the store . He ought to be home now .  Then I think I will wait . I was here once before this morning . I was talking with him about buying one of his horses . If you can spare the time , I would like to have you go with me to the pasture , and I will take another look at the one I saw this morning .  Certainly , sir , said Herbert , driving the ax into the block upon which he had been splitting , prepared to accompany Mr . Richmond to the pasture .  They reached the bars dividing the pasture from the next field . Spitfire was cropping the grass just on the other side .  There , said the stranger , pointing him out , that is the horse I was looking at .  THAT ONE! repeated Herbert , in a tone of surprise .  Yes , he is a fine-looking animal .  Ye-es , said Herbert , hesitatingly .  However , I dont so much care about that , as for his being gentle . I want him for a family horse , such as my wife may drive , without fear , while I am away .  Did Mr . Holden say hes gentle ? asked Herbert .  Yes . He recommended him highly for that , and told me he had no serious defect .  Are you sure this is the horse ? asked Herbert .  Certainly . I am not likely to be mistaken in it . I suppose it is all as he says ?  Herbert was in a perplexing position . He knew that if he told the truth he should incur Abner Holdens anger , but his conscience revolted at suffering the stranger to be taken in , and thus , perhaps , exposing his wife to serious danger .  I am afraid I cannot confirm what Mr . Holden says , he answered , reluctantly . The horse is very ill-tempered , and is blind of one eye .  Is it possible ? Then I have had a narrow escape . You have done me a good service , my boy , in telling me the truth , for I am , myself , unused to horses , and should have taken the animal on your employers recommendation . Accept this acknowledgment of my indebtedness .  He would have placed a five-dollar bill in Herberts hand , but our hero firmly refused to receive it .  I have only done my duty , sir . I cannot accept money for doing that . Thank you all the same .  Perhaps you are right , my lad . If I ever have a chance to serve you , dont hesitate to let me know it .  Therell be a storm if Mr . Holden hears of this , thought Herbert . But I could not do otherwise .     CHAPTER X  THE CLOUDS GATHER   At twelve oclock Abner Holden returned home , still in good humor . As he did not anticipate another call from his expected customer until the afternoon , he made no inquiries .  Perhaps he wont hear about it , thought Herbert , and as he did not wish to have any trouble with Mr . Holden , he hoped it might prove so .  Abner was so elated at the thought of his good bargain in prospect , that he could not keep it to himself .  Ive about sold Spitfire , Mrs . Bickford , he said to the housekeeper .  Sold Spitfire! Who wants to buy him ?  A man that called here this morning . What do you think he wants him for ?  To break his neck , suggested the housekeeper .  He wants him for a good family horse for his wife to drive , and Abner Holden burst into a laugh .  Perhaps hes anxious to become a widower , said Mrs . Bickford .  No; the fact is he thinks the horse is gentle .  You told him so , I suppose ?  Of course , I did .  Knowing it to be false ?  Shut up , Mrs . Bickford . You know all is fair in trade .  No , I dont , Mr . Holden . To my mind , a lies just as much a lie in trade as in anything else . I suppose the man trusted to your recommendation .  Suppose he did . I got cheated on the horse , and Ive got to get rid of it , somehow . As it is , I shall make a handsome profit .  Well , Mr . Holden , all Ive got to say is , I am glad I havent got as tough a conscience as you have .  You dont know anything about business , Mrs . Bickford .  Well , manage things your own way . I aint responsible , but I pity the poor man if he buys Spitfire .  So do I , chuckled Abner . Thats where you and I agree , Mrs . Bickford .  Herbert listened in silence . He was disgusted with the utter disregard of fair dealing exhibited by Abner Holden , though he was not surprised at it . He felt glad that he had been the means of saving Mr . Richmond from being overreached , though he know very well that Mr . Holdens rage would be furious when he learned what had interfered with the trade . He did not feel under any obligations to reveal his own agency in the matter , unless direct inquiry was made of him . In that case , he would manfully stand by his acts .  Im expecting the man this afternoon , Mrs . Bickford , said Mr . Holden , and shall stay around home to see him . When he comes , call me at once; and mind , not a word about Spitfire .  Just as you say . I wash my hands of the whole affair .  Washing your hands wont do you any harm , said Abner , with a laugh at what he supposed to be a witticism .  Mrs . Bickford took no notice of this remark . It was not quite easy to say why she remained in charge of Mr . Holdens household , for certainly , she had no respect for her employer . However , he did not meddle with her , or , if he did , he got the worst of it , and it was perhaps the independence that she enjoyed which led her to remain in the house . Knowing Abners character , she was not particularly shocked at this last evidence of it , but went about her work as usual , with scarcely a thought of what had passed .  Abner Holden sat at the window , and looked up the road , awaiting anxiously the appearance of the customer .  I hope hell bring the money with him , he thought . Id like to have matters all arranged to-day , before he smells a rat . If I get the money once in my hands , he may scold all he pleases about the horse . It wont disturb my rest .  But the old clock in the corner kept ticking--minute after minute passed--and still the stranger did not appear .  He cant have struck a bargain with Sam Nichols , muttered Abner , apprehensively . If he has , itll be sort of a swindle on me . Maybe Nichols has been telling him lies about me .  Abner waxed so angry over this supposition , that although it was merely conjecture , he already began to consider in what way he could come up with Sam Nichols .  That money would come very handy , thought Abner . Theres a horse worth two of Spitfire , I can get for a hundred and fifty , and that would leave me a hundred . I wish he would come .  He looked out of the window , and , not content with that , went out of the front door , and , shading his eyes with his hands , looked up the road . But he could see nothing of Mr . Richmond . Abner began to fear that he had lost his bargain .  I guess Ill put on my hat and go round to the tavern , he said to Mrs . Bickford . If the gentleman I spoke of should call while I am away , just send the boy around after me as quick as possible .  Very well .  Abner Holden walked hurriedly to the tavern , determined to bring about a bargain , which would be so desirable for him , if it were a possible thing . He must and would get rid of Spitfire , however many falsehoods he might have to tell . What was truth in comparison to two hundred and fifty dollars! Suppose Spitfire should run away with the strangers wife and break her limbs , or even her neck , it was everybodys duty to look out for himself in this world .  Thus reasoned Abner Holden . There is no particular need of my commenting upon the fallacy of this reasoning , since it is not likely that any of my young readers will sufficiently admire his character to be in any danger of being led into imitation of it .  At the end of a very few minutes , Abner stood on the piazza , of the tavern , a little out of breath with rapid walking .  Is Mr . Richmond still here ? he inquired of the landlord , anxiously .  Yes , but he means to leave in five minutes .  Where is he ?  In his room .  I want to see him on particular business--I wish you would send up and ask him to come down .  Very well .  William , said the landlord , summoning his son , go up and tell Mr . Richmond that Mr . Holden wishes to see him .  You dont know of his having bought a horse of Sam Nichols , do you ? asked Abner , nervously , of the landlord .  No , I am sure he has not .  Abner felt somewhat relieved by this . As long as he was still unprovided with a horse , there was still a chance of Spitfire . He resolved , if necessary , to abate something from the rather high price he had demanded in the morning .  Mr . Richmond followed William downstairs .  You wish to see me ? he asked , glancing toward Mr . Holden .  Yes , about the horse you were looking at this morning .  I have concluded not to take him , said the other , coldly .  You didnt buy of Sam Nichols , did you ?  No; his horse did not suit me .  You havent any other in your eye , have you ? asked Mr . Holden .  No .  Then , hadnt you better look at mine again ? he said , persuasively .  It would be of no use .  If the price is any objection , said Abner , insinuatingly , I dont know but I might say a LEETLE less , though the animals wuth moren I ask for it .  It isnt the price that stands in the way , Mr . Holden .  What is it , then ? Sam Nichols haint been slandering me , I hope . If he has , Ill be even with him .  Spare your anger against Sam Nichols . He said nothing against you; though I believe you warned me against him .  Yes , I did . I felt it my duty to caution you , so you might not be overreached by him .  You prefer to overreach me yourself , said the other , quietly .  Abner started , and changed color .  What do you mean ? he said . Who told you I wanted to overreach you ?  Why , this is the way the matter stands . I asked you for a good family horse , such as my wife might drive with safety . Didnt you understand me so ?  Of course .  And you tried to sell me an ill-tempered brute , blind of one eye , for an extortionate price . Can you deny it ?  Somebodys been telling you a pack of lies , said Abner , hoarsely .  I dont think they are lies . I have every reason to think they are true . By the way , what is the animals name ?  Spitfire , said Abner , rather reluctantly .  A good name for a family horse , said the stranger , sarcastically .  Where did you learn all this ? demanded Abner . Whos been slandering the horse ?  I got my information at your place , from one who ought to know .  A light dawned upon Abner Holdens mind .  Herbert told him , muttered Abner to himself . That cursed boy has spoiled my bargain , and he shall smart for it .  In a furious rage , he retraced his steps homeward , breathing threats of vengeance dire against our hero .     CHAPTER XI  A CRISIS   Abner Holdens disappointment was excessive at the sudden falling through of his horse trade , and his feeling of anger against Herbert for his agency in the matter was in proportion to his disappointment . His chief thought , as he hurried home from the tavern , was that he would make the boy smart for his interference .  Ill give him a good flogging , muttered Abner to himself , and he felt that this would be some slight compensation for the injury and slight loss which Herbert had caused him to sustain .  Ill teach him to spoil my bargains , he said , while his face wore an expression decidedly ugly . I reckon he wont do it a second time .  It was in this frame of mind that he reached home .  Herbert had just entered the kitchen with an armful of wood for the housekeeper , and having thrown down his burden , was about to go back , when , on turning , he confronted the stormy and wrathful face of his employer .  Hes found out , Herbert concluded at once , and he braced his nerves for the storm which he knew must come .  Well , young man , Ive an account to settle with you , said Abner , abruptly .  Herbert did not reply , but waited for Mr . Holden to state the matter . But in Abners present angry condition , he chose to construe his silence into cause of offense .  Why dont you speak ? he said . What do you mean by looking me impudently in the face ?  I have no intention of being impudent , said Herbert . I think you are mistaken , Mr . Holden .  Do you dare to tell me I am mistaken ? roared Holden , lashing himself into a rage .  I dont mean to do or say anything that is not perfectly respectful , said Herbert , manfully , looking steadily in his employers face .  Why did you tell a pack of lies about my horse this morning , and so make me lose my trade ?  I didnt tell a pack of lies , said Herbert .  Didnt you tell the man who came here that he was an ill-tempered brute , and blind of one eye ?  Abner Holden glared upon the boy as if he wanted to spring upon him , and give him a thrashing on the spot .  I told him that Spitfire was not suitable for a family horse .  What did you tell him that for ?  Because it was true .  Supposing it was true , didnt you know that you were spoiling my trade ?  I am sorry for that , Mr . Holden , but if he had bought the horse , supposing it to be gentle , it might have broken his wifes neck .  What business was that of yours ? That was his lookout .  I didnt look upon it in that way . I thought he ought to buy the horse with his eyes open .  You did , did you ? roared Abner . Then I advise you to open your own eyes , for youre going to get one of the worst lickings you ever had .  Abner Holdens anger now reached an ungovernable pitch . Looking about him for a weapon , he espied the broom resting against the wall . He seized it , and with a scream of rage , made for Herbert , shaking off the grasp of the housekeeper , who tried to stay him .  Herbert , perceiving the peril in which he stood , ran round the table , which stood , with leaves open , in the middle of the floor . Abner pursued him with headlong haste .  Lord preserve us! The man is mad! ejaculated the housekeeper , trying to get out of the way . But in this she was not successful . The kitchen was small , and before she could guard against a collision , Abner had stumbled over Mrs . Bickford , and both came down together . She uttered a succession of piercing shrieks , and , with a view of relieving Herbert , pretended that her life was in danger , grasping Abner by the hair and holding him fast .  Herbert saw that this was the favorable moment for escape , and , seizing his hat , dashed out of the house . He ran across the fields as fast as his limbs could carry him , expecting that he would be pursued . Before we follow him , we will describe the scene that took place after his flight .  Let go my hair , Mrs . Bickford! exclaimed Abner , tugging vainly to break from the housekeepers grasp .  I dare not , she said . Im afraid youll murder me .  You are making a fool of yourself , retorted Abner . What should I murder you for ? But I will , if you dont let go!  Hello , whos talking of murder ? demanded a rough voice .  The speaker was a neighbor , who chanced to be passing , and was led to enter by the uproar , which was plainly audible outside .  Save me! exclaimed Mrs . Bickford . Hes threatened to murder me .  Stop your nonsense , you old fool! retorted Abner , vexed at the equivocal position in which he was placed .  Whats all this row about ? Mr . Holden , you ought to be ashamed of yourself for attacking a defenseless woman .  I didnt intend to , said Abner , sullenly . She got in my way , and I stumbled over her; and then she seized me by the hair .  What were you going to do with that broom ? demanded the other , suspiciously .  What was I going to do ? I was going to thrash that rascally boy of mine , and Mrs . Bickford knew it perfectly well .  What has he done ?  He ? Hes spoiled a trade of mine by his lying , and I was going to flog him for it , when Mrs . Bickford got in my way .  Well , said the visitor , shrugging his shoulders , I dont want to interfere in your affairs . I suppose that youve a right to flog the boy , but it strikes me that a broom handle is rather an ugly weapon .  It isnt half heavy enough , said Abner , savagely; but where is the boy ? Did you see him ?  Given leg-bail , I reckon , and I dont wonder at it .  Run away ? ejaculated Abner , disappointed . Did you see where he went ?  No , I didnt , and if I had , Im not sure that I would tell you .  Abner would like to have thrashed the man who showed so little sympathy with his anger , but he felt that it would hardly be prudent . He went to the door and looked out . But there was no trace of Herbert to be discovered .  Hell get it when he does come back , he said to himself .  The idea that Herbert might not come back at all never once occurred to him . He resolved that the flogging should lose nothing by being deferred .  We must now return to Herbert , whom we left running across the fields .  His departure had been so sudden , that his prominent idea was to get out of the way of his employers violence . He was at first under the impression that he was pursued , but when , after running perhaps a quarter of a mile , he ventured to look around , he saw , to his great relief , that there was no one on his track . Being out of breath , he stopped , and , throwing himself down on the grass in the shadow of a stone wall , began to consider his plans for the future .  Everything was in doubt except one point . He felt that he had broken , finally , the tie that bound him to Mr . Holden . He would not return to him . He had experienced enough of Abners ugly and unreasonable temper to feel that there could be no harmony between them , and as to submitting to personal violence from such a man as that , his blood boiled at the thought . He knew that he should resist with all the strength he possessed , and what the result might be he did not dare to think . What lay before him in the future he could not conjecture , but whatever it might be , he felt that it was better than to remain an inmate of Abner Holdens household , and in his power .  But where should he go ? That was a question not easily answered . After his experience of his uncles indifference to him , he did not wish to appeal to him for aid , yet he felt that he should like to go to New York and try his fortune there . Thousands of people lived there , and earned enough to support them comfortably . Why not he ? It was a thousand miles off , and he might be some time in getting there . He might have to stop and work on the way . But , sooner or later , he resolved that he would find his way to the great metropolis .  But there was one difficulty which presented itself at the outset . This difficulty related to his clothing . He had on a pair of overalls and a ragged vest which Abner had provided for him , intending that he should save the good suit he brought with him for Sundays . His present suit , which had been worn by half a dozen of his predecessors , Herbert decidedly objected to wearing , as , in addition to being faded and worn , it was by no means a good fit . He must get his other suit .  But this was in Mr . Holdens attic , and it would hardly be prudent to venture back for it , as Abner was on the lookout for him , and there would be a collision , and perhaps he might be forcibly detained . Fortunately , his money he had about him . This amounted , as the reader already knows , to nearly fifteen dollars , and would , no doubt , be of essential service to him in the project which he had undertaken . As to the clothes , he must think of a way of securing them , before setting out on his journey to New York .     CHAPTER XII  RALPH THE RANGER   One thing was certain . There was no chance of obtaining the clothes at present . Probably his best course would be to wait till night , and then come back to the house on the chance of gaining Mrs . Bickfords attention . In the meantime , probably , the best thing to be done was to conceal himself temporarily in a belt of woods lying about a mile back of Abner Holdens house .  As soon as his breath was recovered , Herbert got up , and headed for these woods . A few minutes found him in the midst of them . He made his way with some difficulty through the underbrush , parting the thick stems with his hands , until he reached a comparatively open space of perhaps an acre in extent . In the midst of this space a rude hut was visible , constructed of logs , and covered with the branches of trees . In front of it , sitting on the stump of a tree , which perhaps had been spared for that purpose , sat a tall man , with very brown complexion , clad in a rough hunting suit . His form , though spare , was tough and sinewy , and the muscles of his bare arms seemed like whipcords . A short , black pipe was in his mouth . The only covering of his head was the rough , grizzled hair , which looked as if for months it had never felt the touch of a comb or brush .  Herbert , though he had never before seen this singular being , recognized him at once as Ralph the Ranger , as he was properly called in the village . For years he had lived a hermit-like existence in the forest , supporting himself mainly by his rifle . This was not difficult , for his wants were few and simple . What cause led him to shun the habitations of his kind , and make his dwelling in the woods , no one knew , and perhaps no one ever would know , for of himself he was silent , and it was not easy to draw him out .  He looked up as he heard Herberts step , and said , abruptly: Well , boy , what do you want ?  His manner was rough , but our hero was not afraid . He answered frankly , I am hiding .  Hiding ? Who from ?  From Abner Holden .  Humph! Why should you hide from him ? What has he to do with you ?  I am bound to him , and he is angry with me because he thinks I interfered in a trade of his . He wanted to beat me , so I ran away .  Good! said Ralph , approvingly . Tell me about it .  Herbert drew near , and told his story .  Ralph listened attentively .  Boy , said he , I think you are honest . There are not many that can be said of . As for Abner Holden , I know him . Hes a mean skinflint . Pah! and he spit , contemptuously . Youd better not go back to him .  I dont mean to , said Herbert , promptly .  What are your plans ? Have you formed any ?  I want to go to New York .  To New York , repeated Ralph , thoughtfully . You wish to get into the crowd , while I seek to avoid it . But it is natural to youth . At your age , it was so with me . I hope , my boy , the time will not come when you , like me , will wish to shun the sight of men .  Herbert listened in sympathy , not unmingled with surprise , to the speech of this man , which was quite superior to what might have been expected from one of his appearance .  When do you wish to start ? asked Ralph , after a pause .  First , I want to get my clothes .  Where are they ?  In my room , at Mr . Holdens house .  How do you expect to get them ?  Mrs . Bickford , the housekeeper , is a friend of mine . I thought I might go there to-night , and attract her attention without rousing Mr . Holden . She would get them for me .  Good! I will go with you .  Will you ? asked Herbert , gladly .  He had felt a little doubt as to the result of his expedition , as , if Mr . Holden should be awake and start in pursuit , he would stand a good chance of being captured , which , above all things , he most dreaded . But with so able an auxiliary as Ralph , he knew he could bid easy defiance to Abner , however much the latter might desire to molest him .  Yes , I will stand by you , and you shall share my cabin with me as long as you like . You are not afraid of me ?  No , said Herbert , quickly .  Ralph looked kindly at him .  Some of the children run from me , he said . It is not strange , perhaps , for I look savage , I suppose , but you do well to trust me . I will be your friend , and that is something I have not said to any living being for years . I like your face . It is brave and true .  Thank you for your favorable opinion , Mr .-- Here Herbert paused in uncertainty , for he had never heard Ralphs surname .  Call me Ralph . I have done with the title of \ civilization . Call me Ralph . That will suit me best .  Thank you for your kindness , then , Ralph .  What is your name ?  Herbert--Herbert Mason .  Then , Herbert , I think you must be hungry . Have you eaten your dinner ?  No , said Herbert .  Then you shall share mine . My food is of the plainest , but such as it is , you are welcome . Come in .  Herbert entered the cabin . The only table was a plank supported at each end by a barrel . From a box in the corner Ralph drew out some corn-bread and some cold meat . He took a tin measure , and , going out of the cabin , filled it with water from a brook near by . This he placed on the rude table .  All is ready , he said . Take and eat , if my food is not too rude .  Herbert did eat , and with appetite . He was a growing boy , whose appetite seldom failed him , and he had been working hard since breakfast , which he had taken at six , while it was now one oclock . No wonder he was hungry .  Ralph looked on with approval .  You are the first that has shared my meal for many a long day , he said . Day after day , and year after year , I have broken my fast alone , but it seems pleasant , after all , he said , musingly . Men are treacherous and deceitful , but you , he said , resting his glance on the frank , ingenuous face of his youthful guest , you must be honest and true , or I am greatly deceived .  I hope you will find me so , said Herbert , interested more and more in the rough-looking recluse , about whose life he suspected there must be some sad secret , of which the world knew nothing .  After dispatching the meal provided by his hospitable entertainer , Herbert sat down on the grass just outside the cabin , and watched lazily the smoke which issued from Ralphs pipe , as it rose in many a fantastic curl .  How long have you lived here , Ralph ? asked our hero at length .  Ten years , said the recluse , removing his pipe from his lips .  It is a long time .  Yes , boy , a long time in the life of one as young as you , but to me it seems but yesterday that I built this cabin and established myself here .  Are you not often lonely ?  Lonely ? Yes , but not more so than I should be in the haunts of men . I have company , too . There are the squirrels that leap from bough to bough of the tall trees . Then there are the birds that wake me with their singing . They are company for me . They are better company than men . They , at least , will not deceive me .  He paused , and bent his eyes upon the ground . He was thinking , not of the boy beside him , but of some time in the past , and the recollection apparently was not pleasant .  The afternoon wore away at length , and the shadows deepened in the woods . Herbert wandered about , and succeeded in gathering some nuts , which he carried to Ralphs cabin . When eight oclock came , the Ranger said: You had better lie down and rest , my boy; I will wake you up at twelve , and we will go together to Holdens place , and see if we can get your clothes .  To this proposal Herbert willingly assented , as he began to feel tired .  He slept , he knew not how long , when he was gently shaken by Ralph .  Where am I ? he asked , rubbing his eyes .  The sight of the Ranger bending over him soon brought back the recollection of his position , and he sprang up promptly . Ralph showed him an easier way out of the woods than that by which he had entered , and less embarrassed by the growth of underbrush .  In half an hour they were standing by Abner Holdens house . It was perfectly dark , the inmates probably being fast asleep .  I know where the housekeeper sleeps , said Herbert . Ill throw up a pebble at her window , and perhaps it will wake her up .  He did as proposed . Mrs . Bickford , who was a light sleeper , heard , and went to the window .  Whos there ? she asked .  It is I , Mrs . Bickford , said Herbert .  What , Herbert ? Shall I let you in ?  No; I dont want to come in . All I want is my clothes . They are up in my trunk .  Ill go up and get them for you .  She went upstairs and quickly returned with the clothes , which she let down from the window .  Are you hungry , Herbert ? she asked . Let me bring you something to eat .  No , thank you , Mrs . Bickford; I am stopping with Ralph the Ranger . He has kindly given me all the food I want .  What are you going to do ? Are you going to stop with him ?  No , I am going East in a day or two . I am going to New York . I will write to you from there .  I am sorry to have you go , Herbert . I wish things could have been pleasanter , so that you might have stayed . But I think I hear Mr . Holden stirring . Good-by , and may God be with you!  She closed the window hastily , and Herbert , not wishing to get into a collision with Abner Holden , who he suspected might have heard something , withdrew swiftly . Ralph , who was standing near by , joined him , and both together went back to the woods .     CHAPTER XIII  A MOMENT OF PERIL   Abner Holden did not suspect that Herbert actually intended to leave him permanently; but when evening came , and he did not return , he became apprehensive that such was the case . Now , for more than one reason , he objected to our heros leaving . First , because he was a strong , capable boy , and his services were worth considerable , and , secondly , because he disliked Herbert , and it was a satisfaction to tyrannize over him , as his position enabled him to do . There are some men in whom the instinct of petty tyranny exists to such an extent that they cannot feel happy without someone to exercise their authority over . Such a man was Abner Holden . He was a bully and a tyrant by nature , and decidedly objected to losing one so completely in his power as Herbert was .  When night came and Herbert did not return , he decided to search for him , and bring him back , if found , the very next day . He did not impart his purpose to Mrs . Bickford , for he was at no loss to discover that the sympathies of the kind-hearted housekeeper were not with him , but with the boy whom he wished to abuse . When breakfast was over , therefore , he merely said: Mrs . Bickford , I am going out for a short time . If Herbert should return while I am absent , you may tell him to finish hoeing those potatoes in the garden .  Do you think he will come back , Mr . Holden ? asked the housekeeper .  Yes; he will soon be tired of wandering about . He will learn to prize a good home after he has slept out of doors one night .  Mrs . Bickford did not reply; but she did not feel quite so much confidence as her employer appeared to do in the excellence of the home which Herbert had enjoyed under Abner Holdens roof .  Its just as well he doesnt suspect Herberts plan , she thought , and without further words , began to clear away the breakfast dishes .  Abner was not long in deciding that Herbert was hidden in the woods . That , indeed , seemed the most natural place of refuge for one placed in his circumstances . He determined , therefore , to seek there first .  We must now return to Herbert .  If you will wait till nightfall , said Ralph , you will be more safe from pursuit , and I will accompany you for a few miles .  This seemed plausible , and our hero consented .  Ralph went off on a hunting expedition , but Herbert remained behind , fearing that he might tear or stain his clothes , of which it was necessary , now , to be careful . How to pass the time was the question . To tell the truth , the hunters cabin contained little that would help him . There were no books visible , for Ralph seemed to have discarded everything that would remind him of that civilization which he had forsaken in disgust .  Herbert went outside , and watched the squirrels that occasionally made their appearance flitting from branch to branch of the tall trees . After a while his attention was drawn to a bird , which flew with something in its beak nearly to the top of a tall tree not far off .  I shouldnt wonder , thought Herbert , interested , if shes got a nest , and some young ones up there . I have a great mind to climb up and see whether she has or not .  He measured the tree with his eye . It was very tall , exceeding in its height most of its forest neighbors .  I dont know as I can climb it , he said to himself , a little doubtfully; but anyway , I am going to try . Theres nothing like trying .  This was a lucky determination for Herbert , as will speedily appear .  It was twenty feet to the first branching off , and this was , of course , the most difficult part of the ascent , since it was necessary to shin up , and the body of the tree was rather too large to clasp comfortably . However , it was not the first time that Herbert had climbed a tree , and he was not deficient in courage as well as skill . So he pushed on his way , and though once or twice in danger of falling , he at length succeeded in reaching the first bough . From this point the ascent was comparatively easy .  In a short time our hero was elated to find himself probably fifty feet from the ground , so high it made him feel a little dizzy to look down . He reached the nest , and found the young birds--three in number . The parent bird hovered near by , evidently quite alarmed for the safety of her brood . But Herbert had no intention of harming them . He only climbed up to gratify his curiosity , and because he had nothing more important to do . Though he did not know it , his own danger was greater than that which threatened the birds . For , just at that moment , Mr . Holden , in his wanderings , had reached Ralphs cabin , and Herbert , looking down , beheld , with some anxiety , the figure of the unwelcome visitor . He saw Abner enter the cabin , and , after a few moments interval , issue from it with an air of disappointment and dissatisfaction .  How lucky , thought our hero , that he did not find me inside!  Abner Holden looked about him in every direction but the right one . He little dreamed that the object of his pursuit was looking down upon him , securely , from above .  I dont think hell find me , thought Herbert . Wouldnt he give something , though , to know where I am ?  But our young hero was doomed to disappointment . Just at that moment--the unluckiest that could have been selected--he was seized with a strong inclination to sneeze .  Alarmed lest the sound should betray him , he made desperate efforts to suppress it but Nature would have its way , and probably did so with greater violence than if no resistance had been made .  Ker-chew! sneezed Herbert , violently .  As he anticipated , Abners attention was attracted by the loud noise , which he rightly concluded could hardly proceed from a bird or squirrel . He had just been on the point of leaving the cabin for some other part of the woods , but at this sound he stood still . Looking up to discover whence it proceeded , his keen eyes detected Herbert in his lofty perch . His eyes sparkled with joy .  Ha , you young rascal! he exclaimed . So you are there , are you ? You were going to run away , were you ?  Now that Herbert was actually discovered , his fear left him , and he became perfectly self-possessed and confident .  Yes , Mr . Holden , he answered , quietly; such is my intention .  Boldly spoken , said Abner , provoked by our heros coolness , for he had hoped to find him terrified and pleading for forgiveness . I admire your frankness , and will try to equal it . I suppose youll give it up as a bad job now .  No , sir , said Herbert , firmly .  Take care , sir , said Abner , in anger and astonishment . Take care how you defy me . Come down here at once .  What for ? inquired Herbert , without stirring .  What for ? repeated Abner Holden . That I may flog you within an inch of your life .  Thats no inducement , said our hero , coolly .  Do you refuse to obey me ? shouted Abner , stamping angrily .  I refuse to be flogged . You dont get me down for any such purpose , Mr . Holden .  Then , by Heaven , if you wont come otherwise , Ill come up and help you down .  The angry man at once commenced the ascent . Anger gave him strength , and , though he was unaccustomed to climbing , he continued to mount up about halfway to the first branching off , somewhat to Herberts uneasiness , for he felt there was a chance that he might fall into Abners clutches .  But Abners success was only temporary . At the height of a dozen feet he began to slip , and , despite his frantic struggles , he slid gradually to the ground , tearing his coat , which he had not taken the precaution to remove , and blistering his hands .  What was to be done ?  In his anger and excitement , he drew a pistol from his breast pocket , and pointed upward , saying menacingly , Come down at once , you young rascal , or I will fire!  Herbert was startled . He did not believe the pistol to be loaded . Still it might be .  Will you come down ? repeated Abner , fiercely . Quick , or I fire .  Herberts cheek was pale , but in a resolute voice he answered , I will not .  Abner Holder , laid his finger upon the trigger , and would , in his anger , have carried his threat into execution; but at the critical moment he was conscious of a violent blow , and the pistol was wrenched from his hand .  Turning quickly , he met the stern glance of Ralph the Ranger .     CHAPTER XIV  TAKEN PRISONER   What does all this mean ? demanded Ralph , in a tone of command .  What right have you to interfere ? said Abner Holden , sulkily .  The right that any man has to prevent murder , said Ralph , briefly .  I wasnt going to murder him .  What were you going to do ? asked Ralph , looking keenly at Abner . Why were you pointing the pistol at him ?  I wanted to frighten him .  You meant to have him think you were going to fire . I believe you were .  Why didnt he come down when I bade him ?  Ill answer that question , said Herbert , from the top of the tree . Mr . Holden promised to beat me if I would come down , but I didnt think that a sufficient inducement .  I have a right to beat you , said Abner , doggedly . Aint you bound to me; tell me that ?  I was , said Herbert , and if you had treated me well , I would have stayed with you; but I dont mean to remain to be abused .  You hear the lads answer , said Ralph . I like his spirit , and Ill stand by him . He wont return with you .  While this conversation had been going on , Abner had been slowly edging himself toward the spot upon which Ralph had thrown the pistol , which he had wrenched from him . While Ralph was speaking , he suddenly darted forward , seized the weapon , and , facing about , said , with malicious triumph , Now , youre in my power , both of you . Well see whether hell go back with me or not .  As he spoke he pointed the pistol toward Ralph .  The latter laughed contemptuously .  This irritated Abner Holden .  I will count ten , he said . Unless the boy begins to come down before I stop , I fire at you . One--two----  Hold! said Ralph , and , drawing his revolver from beneath his hunting-jacket , he pointed it at Abner . Two can play at that game , Abner Holden . This revolver is fully loaded . It gives me six chances of hitting you . You have but one chance with your pistol . The moment your finger touches the trigger , your doom is sealed . I never miss my aim .  A sickly hue overspread the face of Abner Holden . He had counted on Ralphs being unarmed . He saw that he had made an important and most unlucky mistake .  Put down your revolver , he said , in a very different tone . I wasnt in earnest , you know .  I know nothing of the kind , retorted Ralph . You looked to me as if you were very much in earnest .  Still with his revolver he covered Abner .  Put down your weapon , said Abner , nervously . It might go off .  Yes , it might , returned Ralph . I will lower it , on one condition .  What is that ?  That you lay down your pistol on the ground .  Abner demurred , but finally felt compelled to do as he was commanded .  That is well , said Ralph , quietly . Now , I will take care that you are not tempted by it again .  He walked toward the pistol , lifted it , and , pointing it in the reverse direction , fired it off among the trees .  So much for that , he said . Now , Herbert , you may come down .  Herbert complied promptly . He felt the utmost confidence in the prowess and good faith of his new friend , and did not fear to descend , though his bitterest enemy awaited him beneath .  Meanwhile an idea struck Abner Holden . He saw that he was no match for Herbert as long as Ralph chose to befriend him . He resolved to enlist the latter on his side .  Hark you , Ralph , he said , come aside with me . I wish to speak to you a moment .  Ralph followed him a few paces in silence .  Now what is it you have to say to me ? he demanded .  About this boy , said Abner , insinuatingly . He is bound to me .  Well ?  And the law gives me authority over him .  Well ?  I want him to go back with me .  Well ?  Will you promise not to interfere between us ?  I cant promise that , said Ralph , briefly .  Stay a moment , said Abner , seeing that he was on the point of leaving him; of course , I am willing to make it worth your while . Ill give you--well , three dollars , to help me secure him , and carry him back to my house .  What do you take me for ? asked Ralph , looking at the other , steadily .  For a poor man , said Abner . Think a moment . Three dollars will buy you provisions for a week . They couldnt be more easily earned . In fact , you neednt do anything . Only promise not to interfere between the boy and myself .  Ralph turned upon him scornfully .  I have promised the boy my protection , he said , and you would have me forfeit my word for a paltry three dollars ?  Ill give you five , said Abner , supposing that the sum he had offered was not sufficient .  Not for five dollars , nor five thousand , returned Ralph , shortly . I thought you meant to insult me , but I see you only judge me by yourself . The boy shall not return with you . Make up your mind to that .  I can have you arrested , said Abner , angrily .  Ralph laughed .  Let that comfort you for the loss of the boy , he said .  Ill have the boy , too , muttered Abner , turning to leave them .  Where are you going ? demanded Ralph .  I am going home .  Not yet .  Why not ? demanded Abner , facing about .  Because I cant spare you yet .  What right have you to interfere with my movements ? said Abner .  None , perhaps; but I will inquire into that afterward . It is enough that , for the present , you must stay here .  I shall do no such thing , said Abner , and he again turned to go .  Ralph deliberately lifted his weapon , and took aim .  What do you say now ? he asked .  Surely , you will not fire at me , said Abner , turning pale .  Not if you remain where you are .  How long do you mean to keep me ? demanded Abner , sullenly .  As long as may be necessary . That is all . Herbert , go into the cabin and look in one corner for a cord .  Herbert soon returned with a stout cord , tough and strong .  What are you going to do with that ? asked Abner suspiciously .  Im going to bind you , said Ralph , coolly .  Ill have the law on you for this , said Abner , hoarsely .  All in good time , said Ralph . But I advise you to consider whether the law has nothing to say against attempted murder .  What do you mean by that ?  I mean that you attempted to murder this boy , and would have done so , in all probability , if I had not interfered . When I am arrested , I shall feel it my duty to make this known to the authorities .  Abner was silent . He felt that Ralphs testimony would have an ugly look .  Let me go , he said , after a pause . You neednt be afraid of my troubling either of you . Dont tie me .  Abner Holden , said Ralph , I know you , and I know you are not to be trusted . I have resolved to help this boy to escape from you , and I mean to do it effectually . For this purpose , I must subject you to temporary inconvenience . I advise you not to resist .  He had already tied the hands of Abner Holden , who , as he looked into the fearless , resolute face of the Ranger , felt that it would not do to resist . It chafed him most to think that Herbert , his bound boy , should be a witness of his humiliation , and he scowled savagely at our hero . But Herbert showed no triumph . His was a brave and generous nature , and had it rested with him , he would have let Mr . Holden go , but he did not think it best to interfere .  Ralph quickly tied both hands and feet , and then took the helpless body of Abner into the cabin , where he placed him in one corner .  Are you thirsty ? he asked .  Yes , said Abner , sullenly .  Ralph placed a cup of water to his lips . He also placed a loaf of bread beside him , which , though his hands were tied at the wrist , he would still be able to reach , and then beckoned to Herbert .  Come , he said , it is time that we were going .  Abner gnashed his teeth with anger , as he watched them issue from the cabin together , and felt how utterly helpless he was to prevent them .     CHAPTER XV  A FOUR-FOOTED FOE   Abner Holdens reflections , when he found himself left alone in Ralphs cabin , bound hand and foot , were not of the most agreeable nature . It was humiliating to find himself baffled at every point , and , for once , completely defeated in his attempt to exercise his authority over the boy who had been bound to him .  That Herbert should escape from him beyond the chance of recovery seemed now almost certain . If he were free , something might be done . But he was so securely bound that it was impossible to get free without help , and the lonely situation of the cabin made it very doubtful whether anyone would come within hearing until the return of Ralph himself . When that would be was uncertain .  Three hours passed , and still no prospect of release . The bonds chafed his wrists , and his situation was far from comfortable . He tried to loosen the cords , but without success .  Must I stay here all night ? he thought , in alarm .  But deliverance was at hand , though its first approach was disagreeable .  A large dog entered the cabin through the open door , drawn thither , probably , by curiosity . When he saw Abner he appeared to take a dislike to him , and barked vehemently .  Go away , you brute! said Abner , wrathfully .  The dog , however , appeared instinctively to understand that Abner Holden was able only to threaten him , and barked more furiously than before; sometimes approaching within a foot of the helpless prisoner , and showing a formidable row of teeth , which Abner feared every moment might fasten upon his arm or leg .  Abner Holden was not a man of courage . Though his disposition was that of a bully , he was easily frightened , and the fierce look of the dog alarmed him not a little . In fact , it might have tested the courage of a much braver man than Mr . Holden .  Go away! he shrieked , shrinking back as far as he could from the open mouth of his persecutor .  A hoarse bark was the only reply , and the dog made an artful spring , which was only a feint , but had too much the appearance of earnest to suit his enemy .  Oh , will nobody save me from the brute ? groaned Abner , in an ecstasy of terror . If I could only get my hands loose! and he tugged frantically at the cord .  Feeling how utterly he was at a disadvantage , he condescended to coax his fierce antagonist .  Be quiet , thats a good dog , he said , with hypocritical softness .  The dog noticed a change in his tone , and evidently viewed it with some suspicion . Still his bark became less fierce and his looks less threatening .  Good dog! repeated Abner , in wheedling tones . Theres some dinner .  And he pushed over the provisions which Ralph had left .  While the dog was apparently taking his offer into consideration , a boys voice was heard outside , calling Carlo , Carlo!  The dog pricked up his ears and ran out of the cabin .  So you are here , you truant , said the boy . Why did you run away ? What have you to say for yourself , sir ?  The dog answered by a wag of his tail .  Oh , yes , you may wag your tail , but Ive a great mind to punish you for running away , and putting me to the trouble of finding you .  Hello! cried Abner , in a loud voice .  Whos that ? thought the boy , surprised .  As the voice evidently came from within the cabin , he ventured to the door , and looked in . He was considerably surprised to see Abner Holden , whom he knew well by sight , lying bound hand and foot in the corner .  Is that you , Mr . Holden ? he asked , in a tone of surprise .  Of course it is , said Abner , who was not in a very pleasant frame of mind .  Are you tied ?  Dont you see I am ? snarled Abner .  Who tied you ?  That rascal Ralph . I mean to have him hung , if I live .  Ralph! Why , I thought he was quiet and peaceable .  He tried to murder me , but changed his mind , and tied me , as you see .  I cant understand it .  There is no need of understanding it . Come and unfasten these cords . I feel stiff and cramped .  The boy tried to unfasten the cord , but it was too securely tied .  Where is your knife ?  I havent got any .  Then take the axe .  There was an axe standing at the corner of the room . This the boy got , and , with the keen edge , severed the string .  Abner stretched himself to relieve his cramped limbs . Then he bethought himself of his late persecutor .  Is that your dog ? he asked , surveying his four-legged enemy with no friendly expression .  Yes , thats Carlo . Come here , Carlo .  Hes been in here barking at me , and threatening to bite me , and now Ill have my revenge .  What do you mean ? inquired the boy , in alarm , as Abner seized the axe and swung it over his head .  Stand aside , boy!  What are you going to do ?  Im going to kill that brute .  No , no , hes a good dog . He wont do any harm , said the boy , in alarm .  Ill kill him , said Abner , fiercely .  The dog surveyed his enemy with suspicion . He seemed to understand that danger menaced him . He growled in a low , hoarse , ominous tone , which showed that he was on his guard , and meant to do his part of the fighting , if necessary .  His owner had retreated to the door , and now tried to call him away .  Carlo , Carlo , come out here , sir .  But Carlo would not come . He had no intention of shrinking from the danger that threatened him , but was bent on defending himself , as became a brave and dauntless dog , whose courage was above suspicion .  If Abner had not been so exasperated , he might have been terrified , but anger re-enforced his courage , and , moreover , he had a great deal of confidence that the axe which he held in his hand would make him more than a match for the dog .  Ill kill him! he exclaimed , and once more he swung the axe over his head , and brought it down with a tremendous force in the direction of the dog .  Alas for poor Carlo , if the axe had struck him! But he was wary , and knew something of warlike tactics , and with watchful eye carefully noted Abners movements . The boy uttered a cry of alarm at the peril of his favorite , but Carlo sprang to one side just as the axe descended , and it was buried in the earthen floor of the cabin so deeply that Abner could not immediately recover it .  The advantage was thus transferred to the other side , and the dog was not slow in perceiving it .  With a bound he sprang upon his adversary , and bore him to the floor , seizing his coat between his strong teeth . He pulled and tugged at this with a strength which no ordinary cloth could possibly withstand .  Take him off! take him off! shrieked Abner in terror .  The boy sprang to the rescue .  Come away , Carlo , he said , grasping him by the collar; come away , thats a good dog .  But , habitually obedient as Carlo was , his young master found it difficult to get him away . He felt that he had received a grievous injury--that his life had been attempted--and he wanted to have satisfaction . Finally his master succeeded in drawing him away , but not till Mr . Holdens coat was badly torn .  The latter was crestfallen and angry , and not so grateful as he ought to have been to his young defender .  Ill make your father pay for this coat , you young rascal! he said .  It isnt my fault , Mr . Holden , said the boy .  Yes , it is . It was your dog that tore my coat .  Carlo wouldnt have torn it , if you hadnt attacked him .  He attacked me first .  You had better go away , Mr . Holden , or he may go at you again .  A low growl from the dog whom he held by the collar re-enforced this suggestion , and Abner , uttering threats both against the dog and his master , strode out of the cabin and bent his steps homeward .  As he entered the kitchen , the housekeeper turned , and , noticing his torn coat , exclaimed , Good gracious , Mr . Holden , whats happened to you ? How came your coat so badly torn ?  It was a dog , muttered Abner , who did not care to be questioned .  Mrs . Bickford supposed he must have taken off the coat , and the dog had torn it as it lay upon the ground .  What a pity! she exclaimed . Whose dog was it ?  Alfred Martins . Ill make Martin pay for the coat . He has no right to keep such a brute .  You must be hungry , Mr . Holden .  Yes , get me something as quick as possible .  Have you seen anything of Herbert ? asked the housekeeper .  No , snapped Abner .  This was a falsehood , of course , but he felt rather ashamed to confess that he had seen Herbert , and that the latter had got the better of him . Mrs . Bickford perceived that he was out of humor , and did not press the question . She concluded that he was angry because his quest had been unsuccessful .     CHAPTER XVI  JUST TOO LATE   Leaving Abner Holden bound in his cabin , Ralph led Herbert , by a short path , out of the woods .  Your best course , he said , will be to take the cars for Columbus at Vernon . At Columbus you will go to Wheeling , and from there , over the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad to Baltimore , and thence to New York . But all this will cost money .  I have money , said Herbert .  How much ?  About fifteen dollars .  Is that all ?  Is it not enough to carry me to New York ?  Hardly . Besides , when you get there , how will you get along ? Have you any relations in the city ?  Yes , an uncle .  Then you will go to him ?  No , said Herbert , hastily .  Why not ?  He does not care to see me . Shall I tell you what sort of a letter he wrote to Dr . Kent about me ?  Yes , tell me .  Herbert , in indignant language , which correctly represented his feelings , gave the substance of the letter , which is already known to us .  I shall not feel easy , he said , until I am able to return the ten dollars which my uncle sent me . I am not willing to remain under obligations to one who cares so little for me .  I think you are proud , said Ralph , bending his eyes upon the lads glowing countenance .  Perhaps I am , said Herbert; but is it not a proper pride ?  I cannot say no , answered Ralph; but would you feel the same about incurring obligations to a friend ?  No , said Herbert; that would be different .  I am glad to hear you say so , for I am going to ask you to accept help from me .  To Herberts surprise , Ralph drew out a small bag , originally intended for shot , and drew therefrom five golden coins , of five dollars each .  Take them , he said , simply .  Herbert hesitated , while his face indicated extreme surprise .  I thought-- he commenced , and then paused .  You thought me poor , said Ralph , finishing the sentence for him . Is it not so ?  Yes , said Herbert .  Most people think so , said Ralph . But it was not poverty that drove me from the busy world to this solitude . Rich or poor , I had money enough for my wants . Here I have little use for money . To me it is a useless and valueless thing . You need have no hesitation in taking this . But on second thoughts , I had better give you more . And he was about to draw forth more .  No , no , said Herbert , hastily . It is quite sufficient . You are very , very kind . Some time I hope to repay you .  No , said Ralph . Do not talk of repayment . Let me have the pleasure of giving you this small sum .  How kind you are , said Herbert , impulsively , and to a stranger .  Yet my obligation to you is greater than yours to me , said Ralph .  How can that be ? asked the boy , raising his eyes to Ralphs grave face .  You are the first human being in whose society I have taken pleasure for years . Deeply injured by man , I conceived a hatred for the whole race . But in your frank face I see much to like . I think I could trust you .  I hope so , said Herbert .  You have inspired in me a new feeling , for which I cannot account . Yesterday the world had no attractions for me . To-day I feel an interest in your welfare , at least .  Why do you bury yourself in this lonely place ? said Herbert . You cannot be happy in it . Come with me to New York . It must be a beautiful place .  Ralph smiled gravely .  To the young the world seems bright , he said . It is after years have swept away one illusion after another , after faith in ones fellowmen has been sorely tried , and the hollowness of the worlds friendship has been proved , that the brightness fades .  You have seen more of life than I , said Herbert , and perhaps it is presumption in me to question what you say; but I cannot help feeling that you are mistaken . I am sure that there is such a thing as true friendship .  How many true friends are you blessed with ? asked Ralph , a little sarcasm in his tone .  Not many , perhaps , but some . There is good Dr . Kent and his family . I am sure of their friendship . Then , he added , his color slightly rising , I think I have found another friend , and he looked in the face of his guide .  The grave face softened .  Thank you , my lad , said Ralph . You are right there , at least . You can rely upon my friendship being sincere .  Then I am right , am I not ? said Herbert , smiling brightly .  I believe you are , said the guide , after a pause , and I thank you for teaching me a lesson .  Man was made in the image of God , said Herbert . If we doubt man , I think it is the same as doubting God .  Ralph did not reply , but walked on in thoughtful silence .  How far is it to Vernon ? asked Herbert , when they had emerged from the woods .  It is five miles farther . Can you walk so far ?  Oh , yes; I have good stout legs . But suppose Mr . Holden should escape . He might pursue us .  Ralph smiled .  I think I shall find him in the same place when I return , he said .  He will be very angry with you .  Yes , I suppose so , said Ralph , indifferently .  Are you not afraid he will have you arrested ?  No , I care little . If I am fined , I will pay the fine , and that will be the end of it .  But you might be imprisoned ?  If I see any danger of that , I shall be tempted to charge Abner Holden with his attempt upon your life . Dont make yourself anxious about me , my lad . I have little fear of what the law may do as far as my agency in this affair is concerned .  Ralph seemed so entirely unconcerned that something of his confidence was imparted to Herbert . Noting the erect mien and fearless glance of his guide , every movement betokening strength , he could not help feeling that Abner Holden would be rash to make such a man his enemy . He felt safe in his protection , and his apprehensions of capture passed away . So with lightened heart he walked the five dusty miles to the village of Vernon , accompanied by Ralph .  It was a thrifty village , with neat and tasteful dwellings lining the principal street . The railroad and manufactories had built it up rapidly and given it an air of prosperity which was pleasant to see .  We will go at once to the railway station , said Ralph . You may catch the next train , and it will be as well to leave this neighborhood as soon as possible .  They were fortunate enough to reach the station fifteen minutes before the eastern train departed .  Herbert bought a ticket for Columbus , fifty miles distant , and entered the train .  Good-by , Herbert , said Ralph , from the platform .  Good-by , said Herbert . Thank you for all your kindness to me . Shall I not see you again ?  I do not know , said Ralph , musing . I have no wish nor intention of going to New York at present , yet I have a feeling that we shall meet again .  I hope it may be so , said Herbert . I shall be glad to see you again .  While he spoke the shrill sound of the railway whistle was heard , the train started , and Herbert was fairly off on his journey .  Just as he was leaving the depot , a wagon drove hastily up to the station , and Abner Holden jumped out . Herbert saw him as he looked from the window , and for a moment he was apprehensive , but the train was fairly on the way .  Stop! stop! vociferated Abner . Stop , I say! for he had also caught sight of his bound boy on the way to freedom .  You dont think they will stop the train for you , you fool! said a man standing by . You ought to have come sooner if you wanted to go by this train .  I dont want to go by it , said Abner .  What do you want , then ?  My boys run away , and I have just seen him aboard the train .  Oh , thats it , is it ? Your son ?  No , I hope not . Its a young rascal thats bound to me .  If hes a young rascal , I shouldnt think youd want him back .  Turning away , for he saw that he had failed , his glance rested on Ralph .  Instantly his anger rose .  Its your doings , said he , shaking his fist in impotent wrath at the sturdy hunter , whom he would have attacked had he dared . Its your fault , and you shall pay for it if theres law in the land .  What will the law say to your attempt to shoot the boy ? demanded Ralph , coolly .  Abner turned pale , and realized that his best course was to keep quiet about an affair which might seriously compromise himself .     CHAPTER XVII  NEW ACQUAINTANCES   Herbert stopped overnight at Columbus .  The first train eastward left Columbus at seven oclock in the morning . It was Herberts intention to take this train , but unfortunately , as he thought at the time , the clock at the hotel by which his movements were guided was ten minutes too slow . The consequence was , that before he had quite reached the depot he saw the cars going out at the other end . He ran as fast as possible , hoping still to make up for lost time , but it was in vain .  Youre too late , youngster , said a porter , who had been assisting to stow away baggage . Youll have to wait till the next train .  When does the next train start ? asked our hero .  Twelve oclock .  Then I shall have to wait till that time , Herbert concluded , with regret .  Yet , as he directly afterwards thought , it could make no particular difference , since he had no stated engagement to meet , and this consideration enabled him to bear the inevitable delay with a better grace .  I suppose , he reflected , I might as well go back to the hotel .  He turned to leave the building when a carriage drove hastily up to the station . It was drawn by two horses , and driven by a negro in livery . A lady put her head out of the window and inquired anxiously if the train had started . She addressed this question to Herbert , who happened to be nearest .  Yes , madam , he answered , respectfully .  I am so sorry , said the lady , in a tone of vexation and perplexity . It was very important that my father should take that train .  There is another train that starts at twelve , said Herbert . It will make a difference of a few hours only .  Yes , said the lady , but you do not understand my difficulty . The few hours difference in time would be of small importance , but my father is blind , and is , of course , for that reason , dependent upon the kindness of others . A gentleman of our acquaintance was going by this train , who would have taken charge of him and seen him safe to his destination . By losing the train we lose his services .  My dear , said an elderly gentleman , sitting on the opposite seat , if I can get somebody to see me on board , I think I can manage very well .  On no account , father , was the hasty reply , particularly under present circumstances .  Where is the gentleman going ? asked Herbert , with interest .  To Philadelphia .  I am going on to New York , said our hero . I have been disappointed like you . I expected to take the early train .  Do you intend to go by the next train , then ? asked the lady .  Yes , madam .  Then , perhaps--I have a great mind to ask you to take charge of my father .  I shall be very glad to be of service to you , said Herbert . There is only one objection , he added , with some embarrassment .  What is that ?  Why , said Herbert , frankly , I am obliged to be economical , and I was thinking of buying a second-class ticket .  Oh , said the lady , promptly , there need be no difficulty about that . If you will take the trouble to look after my father , we will gladly pay for your ticket .  I am afraid my services will not be worth so much , said Herbert , modestly .  You must leave us to estimate them . If you do what you have undertaken , we shall consider the expense well incurred .  Herbert made no further objection . He felt , indeed , that it would be quite a lift to him , in the present state of his finances , and besides would be a very easy way of earning the money . He therefore signified his thanks and his acceptance of the offer .  When did you say the train starts ? asked the lady .  At twelve .  Nearly five hours . That will be too long to wait . I think , father , we will go home .  Yes , my dear , I think that will be best .  Are you obliged to go home before starting ? the lady inquired , addressing Herbert .  No , madam , I have no home in Columbus . I passed last night at a hotel .  Have you any particular plan for spending the next few hours ?  Herbert answered in the negative .  Then will you not ride home with us ? You will then be ready to start with my father .  I shall be happy to do so .  I think that will be much the best plan . Pompey , open the carriage door for the young gentleman .  Our hero was about to say that he could just as well open the door for himself , but he reflected that it was best to adapt himself to the customs of those he was with . He bowed , therefore , and waited till the coachman had opened the door for him , and stepped into the carriage . The lady signed to him to take a seat beside her , and the door was closed .  Home , Pompey , said she , briefly .  The coachman ascended to his seat , and the spirited grays were soon whirling the party rapidly homeward .  It was a new position for our hero , and he felt it to be so . His parents had never been rich , and latterly had been very poor . Living in a small country village , he had never even seen so elegant a carriage as that in which he was now riding He sank back upon the luxuriously cushioned seat , and he could not help thinking how pleasant it would be if he could command so comfortable a conveyance whenever he wanted to ride out . But another thought succeeded this . If he were blind , like the gentleman whom he was to take charge of , it would be a very poor compensation to ride in a luxurious carriage . After all , things were not so unequal as they seemed at first sight .  Since you are to be my fathers traveling companion , said the lady , perhaps you will not object to telling us your name .  Certainly , said our hero , my name is Herbert Mason .  Are you going from home for the first time ? inquired the lady .  I have no home , said Herbert . My father and mother are both dead .  Excuse me , said the lady , gently . I am sorry to have touched upon a subject which must awaken sorrowful recollections . My fathers name is Carroll . Father , you have heard that your young escort is Mr . Herbert Mason .  The old gentleman extended his hand , which Herbert took respectfully .  I am afraid you will find me a troublesome charge , he said . Since I have become blind I have been compelled to tax the kindness of others .  The journey will be pleasanter to me , said Herbert , politely , than if I were alone .  Mr . Carroll was evidently pleased with this remark , for he turned toward Herbert with increased interest .  You can imagine how much more so it will be to me , he said . I have not your resources for beguiling the tedium of the way . I would give all my possessions gladly , for your young eyes . All journeys are alike to me now , since , however interesting the scenery , it is a blank to me .  That is indeed a privation , sir .  Especially in the journey we are about to take . The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad , as it is called , runs through a romantic and charming country , and affords views at once bold and beautiful . Have you ever traveled over the road ?  No , sir .  Then you will have all the pleasure of a first discovery . Before I became blind , before , indeed , the railway was located , I became , as a young man , familiar with this whole section of country , so that I have , at least , the remembrance of it . I am obliged now to live upon my memory .  You say you have never been over this railroad , said the lady . Have you ever been to the East ?  No , madam , I have always lived in the State of Ohio .  And you are now going to Philadelphia ? she inquired .  I am going to New York , said Herbert .  Indeed! Is it on a visit ?  No , madam , I am expecting to live there; that is , if I can make a living .  Are you dependent , then , upon your own exertions for support ?  Yes , madam .  You seem very young for such a responsibility .  I am fourteen .  I thought you a year older . My Oscar is fourteen , and I am afraid he would make a poor hand at supporting himself . What do you think , father ?  I think you are right , my dear . Oscar has not been placed in circumstances to develop his self-reliance .  No; that probably has something to do with it . But , Herbert , if you will permit me to call you so , do you not look forward to the future with apprehension ?  No , madam , said Herbert . I am not afraid but that I shall be able to get along somehow . I think I shall find friends , and I am willing to work .  That is the spirit that leads to success , said the old gentleman , approvingly . Work comes to willing hands . I think you will succeed .  I hope so , sir .  Our hero was gratified to meet with so much sympathy from those whose wealth placed them far above him in the social scale . But it was not surprising , for Herbert had a fine appearance and gentlemanly manners , marked , too , by a natural politeness which enabled him to appear better than most boys of his age .     CHAPTER XVIII  A YOUNG ARISTOCRAT   After a drive of three miles , which was accomplished in a short time by the spirited horses , the carriage entered , through an ornamental gate , upon a smooth driveway , which led up to a handsome mansion , of large size , with a veranda stretching along the entire front .  A boy , a little smaller than Herbert , ran out of the front door , and opened the door of the carriage before Pompey had time to descend from the box .  What , grandpa , come back ? he said , in surprise .  Yes , Oscar , we were too late for the train , said his mother . I brought you back a companion for a few hours . This is Herbert Mason , whom I intrust to your care , depending upon you to see that he passes his time pleasantly .  Oscar looked at Herbert inquisitively .  Herbert offered his hand , saying , I am glad to make your acquaintance , Oscar .  How long are you going to stay ? asked Oscar , as his mother and grandfather went into the house .  I must return in time to take the twelve oclock train .  Is grandpa going , too ?  Yes .  And are you going to take care of him ?  I believe so .  I wouldnt want to .  Why not ?  Oh , its an awful bore to be tied to a blind man .  Youd find it more of a bore to be blind yourself , said Herbert .  Yes , I suppose I should . Grandpa wants me to go to walk with him sometimes , but I dont like it .  If I had a grandfather who was blind , I think I should be willing .  Wait till you have one , and youll see how it is then .  I suppose he needs somebody .  Oh , well , he can take one of the servants , then . Its their business to work .  Where do you live ? he asked , after a pause .  I am going to live in New York .  Are you ? I should like to go there .  Perhaps you wouldnt want to go as I am going .  What , alone ? Yes , I should rather go that way . Then I could do as I pleased . Now its Oscar , do this , and You mustnt do that , all the time .  That isnt what I mean exactly . Ive got to earn my own living after I get there , and I dont know anybody in the city .  You havent run away from home , have you ?  I havent got any home .  Wheres your father and mother ?  They are both dead .  What are you going to do ?  I hope to get into a store or counting-room and learn to be a merchant .  I shant have to work for a living , said Oscar , in a tone of importance .  Because your family is rich , I suppose , said Herbert .  Yes , weve got a large estate , ever so many acres . Thats what mothers got . Then grandpa is rich besides , and I expect he will leave me a good deal of his money . Hes pretty old , and I dont believe hell live very long .  Oscar said this with such evident satisfaction that Herbert was disgusted , thinking it not very creditable to him to speculate so complacently upon his grandfathers speedy death .  You seem to be well off , then , said he , at last , to the boy .  Yes , said Oscar , our family is one of the first in the State . My father is a Peyton .  Is he ? asked Herbert , not appearing as much awestruck as Oscar expected .  Weve got a plantation in Virginia . We live there part of the year . My fathers there now . I hope we shall go there soon .  Do you like it better than here ?  Yes , a good deal .  This is a handsome place .  Yes , this is mothers estate . The other belongs to father .  Have you any brothers and sisters , Oscar ?  Ive got one sister . Shes about twelve . But , I say , I thought you were a gentlemans son when I first saw you .  So I am , said Herbert , emphatically .  Was your father rich ?  No .  Did he have to work for a living ?  Yes .  Then he wasnt a gentleman , said Oscar , decidedly .  Isnt anybody a gentleman that has to work for a living ? asked Herbert , his indignation excited by his companions assumption of superiority .  Of course not , said Oscar , coolly . It isnt respectable to work . Niggers and servants work .  That is where I dont agree with you , said Herbert , his face flushing .  You dont pretend to be a gentleman , do you ? demanded Oscar , insolently .  Yes , I do , said Herbert , firmly .  But youre not one , you know .  I dont know anything of the kind , said Herbert , angrily . I suppose you call yourself one .  Of course , I am a gentleman , said Oscar , complacently .  You dont talk like one , at any rate , retorted Herbert .  This was new language for Oscar to hear . He had been accustomed to have his own way pretty much , and had been used to order round his fathers servants and slaves like a little despot . The idea of being told by a boy who had to work for a living that he did not talk like a gentleman , did not suit him at all . His black eyes flashed and he clenched his fists .  Do you mean to insult me ? he demanded .  I never insult anybody , said Herbert , not feeling particularly alarmed by this hostile demonstration . It is you that have insulted me .  Didnt you tell me I was not a gentleman ? said Oscar , hotly .  I said you did not talk like one .  Thats about the same thing , said Oscar .  Just as you like . Even if I did say so , you said the same of me .  Well , suppose I did .  I am as much a gentleman as you , to say the least , asserted Herbert .  If you say that again , Ill knock you down , said Oscar , furiously .  Ill say it all day , if I like , said Herbert , defiantly .  Perhaps it would have been better for Herbert to stop disputing , and to have taken no notice of Oscars words . But Herbert was not perfect . He had plenty of spirit , and he was provoked by the airs Oscar chose to assume , and by no means inclined to allow him to arrogate a superiority over himself , merely on account of his wealth . Though manly and generous , he was quick to resent an insult , and accordingly , when Oscar dared to repeat what he had said , he instantly accepted the challenge as recorded above .  Had Oscar been prudent , he would have hesitated before endeavoring to carry his threat into execution . A moments glance at the two boys would have satisfied anyone that the chances , in a personal contest , were decidedly in our heros favor . Herbert was not only a little taller than Oscar , perhaps an inch and a half , but his shoulders were broader and his frame more muscular . Oscar had never done any work to strengthen his arms , while Herbert had been forced by circumstances to do so .  Oscar flung himself upon Herbert , and endeavored to bear him to the ground . But the latter , without an effort , repelled the charge , and flung himself free from his antagonists grasp .  This naturally made Oscar more determined to overcome his foe . His face red with passion , he showered blows upon Herbert , which the latter parried with ease . At first he acted wholly upon the defensive , but , finding that Oscars impetuosity did not abate , suddenly closed with him and threw him down .  Oscar rose but little hurt , for Herbert used no unnecessary force , and recommenced the assault . But the result was the same as before . Oscar was almost beside himself with mingled rage and mortification , and it is hard to tell how long the contest would have lasted , had not a servant come up and informed the boys that Mrs . Peyton wished to see them immediately . She had witnessed the whole scene from a window and felt called upon to interfere .  How is this , young gentleman ? she asked , gravely . You have scarcely been together twenty minutes , and I find you fighting .  I beg your pardon , Mrs . Peyton , said Herbert , in a manly tone . I feel ashamed of myself , but Oscar attacked me for claiming to be a gentleman , and I am afraid that my blood was up , and so we got into a fight .  How is this , Oscar ? said his mother . Did you so wholly lose your politeness as to attack your guest for asserting his claims to be a gentleman ? I am annoyed with you .  He says he has to work for a living , said Oscar , sullenly .  So may you , some time .  I am rich .  You may not always be . At any rate , being rich doesnt insure gentlemanly behavior , as your conduct to-day clearly shows . Herbert , I hope you will excuse my sons rudeness .  Here is my hand , Oscar , said Herbert , cordially . Let us be friends .  Oscar hardly knew how to receive this overture , but he was finally thawed by Herberts manner , and they were soon sauntering about on the lawn on the best of terms .  At half-past eleven , after an inviting lunch , the carriage was ordered , and Herbert and Mr . Carroll were driven to the depot , accompanied by Oscar , who went in his mothers place .  Herbert purchased tickets for both , being intrusted with Mr . Carrols pocketbook for that purpose . He found a comfortable seat for the old gentleman , and sat down beside him .     CHAPTER XIX  A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER   I pass over the route pursued by the travelers from Columbus to Wheeling , in West Virginia , as it possesses no special interest .  But after leaving Wheeling there is quite a change . Those of my readers who are familiar with the Baltimore & Ohio Railway will be able to understand the enjoyment which Herbert derived from the bold and romantic scenery visible from the car windows . Mr . Carroll made him take the seat nearest the window , that he might have a better view , and from time to time Herbert described what he saw to his sightless fellow-traveler .  Northwestern Virginia is very mountainous and the construction of a railway through such a region was a triumph of engineering skill . At times the road makes bold curves , so that the traveler , looking from the car window , can see opposite him , across an intervening gulf , the track over which the train was passing five minutes before . At some places the track is laid on a narrow shelf , midway of the mountain , a steep and rugged ascent on one side , a deep ravine on the other , somewhat like the old diligence road over the Alpine Mt . Cenis . Here and there appear small hamlets , consisting of one-story cabins , with the chimney built alongside , instead of rising from the roof in the usual manner .  How long shall we be in reaching Baltimore , Mr . Carroll ? asked Herbert .  I believe it takes about twenty-six hours , said the old gentleman . But I do not mean to go through without stopping .  I didnt know what your plan was , said Herbert .  I have been meaning to tell you . Our tickets will allow us to stop anywhere , and resume our journey the next morning , or even stop two or three days , if we like .  That is convenient .  Yes . If it had been otherwise , I should have purchased the ticket piecemeal . I cannot endure to travel all night . It fatigues me too much .  Where shall we stop , then ?  I have not yet quite made up my mind . We will ride till about eight oclock , and then stop over at whatever place we chance to have reached .  This arrangement struck Herbert favorably . He was in no particular hurry , and the scenery was so fine , that he feared that he should lose a great deal by traveling at night , when , of course , he could not see anything .  They sat for a while in silence . Then Mr . Carroll inquired , suddenly , Did you ever fire a pistol , Herbert ?  Yes , sir , was the surprised reply .  Then you understand how to use one ?  Oh , yes , sir . There was a young man in Waverley , the town where I used to live , who owned one , and I sometimes borrowed it to fire at a mark .  Then I think I will intrust this weapon to your charge , said the old gentleman , drawing from his pocket a handsome pistol , and placing it in Herberts hand .  Is it loaded , sir ?  No , not at present . We will have it loaded before going to bed . I will tell you , he added , in a lower tone , my reason for going armed . It so happens that I have a large amount of money with me , and , of course , I feel a little concerned about its safety .  Perhaps it will be well not to say anything more about it at present , sir , suggested Herbert , in a low voice . You may be heard by someone who would like to take advantage of his discovery .  No doubt you are right . I will follow your advice .  Herbert would not have thought to give this caution , but , just as Mr . Carroll uttered the words , I have a large sum of money with me , a man dressed in a rough frieze coat , with black whiskers , and a general appearance , which , to say the least , did not prepossess Herbert in his favor , chanced to walk through the car . Whether he caught the words Herbert could not tell , but he paused a moment , and fixed an unpleasant eye upon the two , as if determined to know them when he should meet them again . There was another suspicious circumstance . It had evidently been his intention to pass through the car , but he paused abruptly , and , turning back , sank into an unoccupied seat a few feet back of that occupied by Mr . Carroll and his young companion .  His attention naturally drawn by this suspicious conduct , Herbert was impelled to glance back once or twice . Each time he met the watchful look of the man fixed upon them , instead of being directed at the scenery outside , as was the case with the other passengers . When he saw that the boy was watching him , he turned his head carelessly , and commenced whistling . But this apparent indifference did not deceive Herbert for a moment .  I will watch him , thought our hero . I do not like his looks . If he means mischief , as I think very probable , it is necessary that I should be on my guard against him .  At half-past seven oclock Mr . Carroll signified his intention of getting out at the next station . I am beginning to feel tired , he said , and shall feel the better for a good supper and a nights rest .  Very well , sir , said Herbert .  It occurred to him that now they would get rid of the man who was watching them so closely .  If he gets out of the train with us , he thought , I shall know what it means .  The train slackened its speed , the sound of the whistle was heard , the brakes were applied , and soon the conductor , putting his head in at the door , called out Oakland!  Here we are , said Herbert . Give me your hand , Mr . Carroll , and I will lead you out .  The old gentleman rose from his seat , and , guided by Herbert , walked to the car door . At the door Herbert turned and looked back .  The man with the black whiskers , who a moment before seemed absorbed in a newspaper , had left his seat , and was but a few feet behind him .  Herbert did not believe that this was an accident . He felt sure that it meant mischief . But he did not on that account feel nervous , or regret that he had assumed a charge which seemed likely to expose him to peril . He had the pistol in his pocket , and that he knew would make him even with the rascal who was following them .  There was a covered carriage waiting outside to convey passengers to the only hotel which the village afforded .  Shall we take the carriage , Mr . Carroll ? asked Herbert .  Yes , was the reply .  Herbert assisted him in , and placed himself in a seat opposite .  There were two or three other passengers , but the man with the black whiskers was not to be seen among them .  I may be mistaken , thought Herbert , who had rather expected to see him . Perhaps he lives here , and I have been alarming myself without reason . Still , it is always best to be on ones guard .  A ride of half a mile brought them to a small but comfortable-looking inn . Herbert assisted Mr . Carroll to descend , and together they entered the house of entertainment .  We shall want some supper . Herbert , said Mr . Carroll . You may order some .  What shall I order , sir ?  I should like some tea and toast and some beef-steak . If there is anything that you would prefer , you may order that also .  No , sir , I should not wish anything better than you have ordered .  Tell them to get it ready as soon as possible . I feel weary with my days ride , and shall retire early .  I feel tired , too . thought Herbert , but it wont do for me to sleep . I must keep my eyes open , if possible .  Supper was soon served . The toast was well browned , and spread with excellent butter . The steak was juicy and tender , contrary to the usual custom of country inns , and the tea was fragrant and strong . Both the travelers partook heartily , having eaten nothing since noon , with the exception of a little fruit purchased from the car window at one of the stations . Herbert was not usually in the habit of drinking tea at night , but on this particular occasion he wanted to keep awake , and therefore drank two cups , of undiminished strength .  Now , Herbert , said Mr . Carroll , when they had finished supper , you may ask the clerk to assign me to a large room with a couple of beds in it . I should prefer to have you in the same room with me .  Very well , sir .  He rose from the table , and went to the public room , one portion of which was occupied by the office . As he made his way to the desk , he observed the man with black whiskers on a settee at one end of the room . He was smoking a clay pipe . Herbert caught a stealthy glance directed towards himself , but that was all . The man continued smoking , fixing his eyes with apparent interest on a large yellow handbill pasted on the opposite wall , announcing a performance by The Great American Circus Company the succeeding evening .  Herbert succeeded in obtaining such a room as he sought , and accompanied by a servant bearing a lamp , went back to the dining-room to accompany Mr . Carroll to it .     CHAPTER XX  FACING A BURGLAR   Herbert deliberated as to whether it would be best to inform his aged traveling companion of the suspicious-looking man , who appeared to have followed them for no good purpose . He finally decided not to do so , since it would only alarm Mr . Carroll , and prevent his sleeping off his fatigue , while there would be no advantage gained , since a blind and feeble man could be of little use in repelling the burglar , should the stranger prove to be such .  The bedroom was large and square , and contained two beds . The larger of these was placed in the corner , and this was assigned to the old gentleman . The smaller was situated between the two side windows , and was , of course , the more exposed of the two . This Herbert was to occupy .  Do you know how to load the pistol , Herbert ? asked Mr . Carroll .  Yes , sir , said Herbert , confidently .  I dont anticipate any occasion for using it , continued the old gentleman . Still , it will be best to be prepared .  So I think , sir .  You wont be afraid to use it , if it should be necessary ?  No , sir .  Mr . Carroll took a package from his carpet-bag and showed it to Herbert .  This package , he said , contains five thousand dollars in bank bills . If it were known that I had it , I should be in danger . I suppose it will be best to put it back in the carpet-bag .  If it were mine , said Herbert , I would not do that .  Where , then , would you put it ?  I would put it between the mattresses . If anyone should get into the room , they would seize the carpet-bag first , and , perhaps , make off before they could be stopped .  I dont know but you are right , said Mr . Carroll . Perhaps it will be well to put my watch in the same place .  Yes , sir; I think it would be well .  You see , Herbert , continued the old gentleman , how much confidence I repose in you . Knowing where my watch and money are , it would be very easy for you to secure both , and leave me here , destitute and helpless .  But you dont think there is any danger of my doing so ?  No , said the old gentleman . Though our acquaintance is so recent , I feel great confidence in you . As I cannot see the face , I have learned to judge of the character by the tone of the voice , and I am very much mistaken if you are not thoroughly honest and trustworthy .  Thank you , sir , said Herbert , his face flushed with pleasure at this evidently sincere commendation . You shall not repent your confidence .  I am sure of that , Herbert , said Mr . Carroll , kindly . But I must bid you good-night . This has been a fatiguing day , and I shall lose no time in getting to sleep .  Good-night . I hope you will sleep well , sir , said Herbert . There wont be much sleep for me , he thought .  Mr . Carroll lay down , and his deep , tranquil breathing soon assured our hero that he was asleep . He rose from his bed and examined the windows . All but one were provided with fastenings . But the one on the right-hand side of his bed could be raised from the outside without difficulty .  I wish I had a nail , thought Herbert . I could soon make it fast .  But there was none in the room , and he did not wish to go downstairs for one , since he would probably meet the stranger , who would then learn what precautions he was taking , and so , perhaps , vary his attack .  That window will need watching , thought Herbert . I wonder whether I shall be able to keep awake .  The excitement of his situation , and , perhaps , the strong tea , to which he was unaccustomed , helped him to remain vigilant . His mind was active and on the alert , and his ears were open to catch the least sound .  It was only half-past ten . Probably the attempt to enter the room would not be made before twelve , at least , in order to insure their being asleep .  Herbert examined his pistol . It was in excellent order , and was provided with two barrels , both of which he loaded . Thus , he would have a double chance to defend himself . He did not remove all his clothing , but kept on his pants , in order to be prepared for emergencies .  There was an hour and a half to wait before midnight . The minutes passed slowly . Herbert for a time heard the murmur of voices in the barroom below , then steps ascended the stairs , and , after a while , all was hushed .  I wish the fellow would come quick , he thought , if he is coming at all , so that it might be all over , and I might go to sleep .  Time sped on . Herbert could hear the village clock striking twelve; but still all around remained quiet .  It might have been a half an hour later when he heard a slight noise , as he thought , under the window . Jumping softly out of bed , he took a peep out . It was just light enough for him to distinguish a dark form moving about , bearing something , which he soon perceived to be a ladder . That it was the black-whiskered man who had followed them , he did not doubt , and he felt confident that he intended to place the ladder against the window . He was not mistaken . He heard the top of the ladder softly inclined against the house , and then he felt that the critical moment , which was to test his courage , was close at hand .  Herberts heart began to beat rapidly . He felt that he was taking upon himself a fearful responsibility in shooting this man , as he would probably be obliged to do in self-defense . But one thing he resolved upon . He would not take his life . He would only use such a degree of violence as should be absolutely necessary . He would even give him a chance by firing the first barrel in the air , in hope of frightening the robber . If that failed , he must wound him . There was little time for these thoughts to pass through his mind , for all the while the man was creeping up the ladder .  Herbert had moved a little aside , that he might not be seen .  Soon he perceived , by the indistinct light , the face of the stranger rising above the window-sill . Next , the window was slowly raised , and he began to make preparations to enter the room . Then Herbert felt that it was time for him to appear .  Stepping intrepidly to the window , he said: I know your purpose . Unless you go down instantly , I will shoot you .  There was no tremor in his voice as he said this . Courage came with the occasion , and his tone was resolute , and self-possessed .  So youre awake , are you , my chicken ? was the reply . If you know whats best for yourself , youll hand over the old mans money , and save me the trouble of getting in .  Never! said Herbert , firmly .  Then I will take it myself , and give you something to remember me by , you little fool!  He placed his knee on the window-sill , and prepared to jump in .  One step farther , said Herbert , resolutely , and I fire!  He displayed the pistol , at the sight of which the burglar hesitated .  Hold on a bit , said he , pausing . Ill give you some of the plunder , if youll put up that shooting iron , and make no trouble .  Do you think me a villain , like yourself ? asked Herbert .  By ---- , you shall repent this , said the robber , with an oath , and he made another attempt to enter .  Click!  There was a sharp report , but Herbert had fired in the air , and the burglar was unhurt .  Confusion! he exclaimed; that will raise the house!  Then , espying the carpet-bag , he determined to jump in , seize it , and get away before the people in the house were fairly awake . As for the pistol , that had been discharged , and he supposed that nothing was to be feared from it . But he reckoned without his host . As he put one leg over , and had all but succeeded in getting in , Herbert fired once more , this time hitting him in the shoulder . He uttered a shriek of pain , and , losing his hold , tumbled backward to the ground .  The two reports alarmed the house .  Whats the matter ? exclaimed Mr . Carroll , awakened and alarmed .  Dont be alarmed , sir , said Herbert . A man just attempted to get in through the window , and I have wounded him .  You are a brave boy , said Mr . Carroll . Where is he now ?  He has tumbled to the ground , shot through the shoulder , I think .  There was a loud thumping at the door . Herbert opened it , and admitted half a dozen guests , headed by the landlord .  Whats the matter ? exclaimed all , in chorus .  If you will come to the window , gentlemen , I will show you , said Herbert .  They followed him curiously , and the sight of the ladder and the wounded man , who was uttering groans of pain from the ground below , told the story at once .  Served the rascal right , said the landlord . Who is he ?  The black-whiskered man who was in the barroom last night , said Herbert .  I remember now; he asked particularly where you were to sleep--you and the old gentleman--but I did not suspect his purpose .  I did , said Herbert , and kept awake to be ready for him .  You are a brave lad .  I only did my duty , said Herbert , modestly .  Help! help! groaned the wretch below .  Herbert heard the cry of pain , and his heart was filled with pity . The man was , indeed , a villain . He had only been served right , as the landlord said . Still , he was a fellow-creature , and he was in pain . Herbert could not regret that he had shot him; but he did regret the necessity , and he felt sympathy for him in his suffering .  Poor fellow! he said , compassionately; I am afraid he is a good deal hurt .  Poor fellow! echoed the landlord . It serves him right .  Still , he is in pain , and he ought to be cared for .  He has no claim upon us . He may be there till morning .  No , said Mr . Carroll . Herbert is right . He is guilty , but he is in pain , and it is the part of humanity to succor him . Landlord , if you will have him brought in , and send for the doctor , you may look to me for your pay .  Yet , he was going to rob you , sir , said the landlord , considerably surprised .  Yes , that is true; but you dont know how strongly he was tempted .  He looks like a hard ticket . I didnt like to give him a bed , but we cant well refuse travelers , if they have money to pay their reckoning . I made him pay in advance .  Pray , lose no time , said Herbert , as another groan was heard; I will go out and help you bring him in .  A lantern was lit , and the whole company followed the landlord out .  Well , said he , throwing the light of the candle full on the sufferers face , youve got yourself into a fine pickle , havent you ?  Oh , groaned the burglar , if it hadnt been for that accursed boy!  Youd have got off with the old gentlemans money . Well , it was rather unkind to interfere .  Are you in much pain ? asked Herbert , bending over him .  There was something in his voice that betrayed the compassion he really felt .  The burglar looked up .  Youre the boy that wounded me , aint you ? he asked .  Yes , said Herbert .  Curse you! I dont know but youve killed me . Im shot through the shoulder . Then , that cursed fall! I feel as if I had broken my back .  I did not want to shoot you , said Herbert .  What did you do it for , then ?  Because you forced me to it . You were after Mr . Carrolls money .  Didnt I offer to divide with you ?  Yes , but , of course , I would not agree to that .  Are you so much better than common folks ? sneered the burglar .  I dont know about that . I would not steal .  Take him up , said the landlord to the hotel servants . He dont deserve it , but Ive promised the old gentleman wed see to him . Tom White , you may go for the doctor .  Two men approached and attempted to lift the wounded burglar . But , in the first attempt , they touched the injured shoulder . He uttered a shriek of pain , and exclaimed , Youll murder me!  Let me lift him , said Herbert . Perhaps you were too rough .  At length , but not without much groaning on the part of the burglar , he was got into the house , and laid on a bed in a small room on the first floor .  Do you feel better ? asked Herbert .  A little .  Do you think you have broken any bones in falling ?  I thought so at first , but perhaps I am only bruised .  When the doctor comes , he will extract the bullet , and relieve you of a good deal of your pain .  You are a strange boy , said the burglar , with a look of surprise .  Why am I ?  You shot me , and yet you pretend to be sorry for me now .  So I am .  Then , why did you shoot me ?  I have already told you . Because I was obliged to . I would not have done it , if there had been any other way . I shot the first barrel in the air .  By accident ?  No; I thought it would alarm you , and I might save the money without injuring you .  Do you really mean that ?  Yes .  And you dont have any ill-will against me now ?  No .  That is strange .  I dont know why it should be .  I suppose I ought to hate you , because you have brought me to this pass , said the burglar , thoughtfully , but I dont . That is strange , too .  I am so glad you feel so , said Herbert . I am very sorry for your pain , and I will do what I can to relieve it .  I have no money to pay the landlord and the doctor .  Mr . Carroll says he will pay all needed expenses .  The man I wanted to rob ?  Yes .  Then hang me , if I aint ashamed of trying to rob him , said the burglar , earnestly .  Have you ever robbed anyone before ?  No , I havent . Im a rough customer , and have done plenty of mean things , but this is the first job of the kind I ever attempted . I wouldnt have done it , only I heard the old man say in the cars , that he had a lot of money with him . I was hard up , and on my way to Cedarville , to try to get work , but when I heard what he said , the devil tempted me , I believe , and I determined to keep you both in sight , and get out where you did . Ive tried and failed , and thats the end of it . Its my first attempt at burglary .  I hope it will be the last .  You may bet your life on that!  Then , said Herbert , quietly , I will intercede with Mr . Carroll for you , and ask him not to have you arrested .  Will you do that ? asked the wounded man , eagerly .  I promise it .  If you will , boy , I will bless you , and if God would listen to such a scamp as I am , Id pray for you .  He will listen to you , said Herbert . Try to lead a better life , and He will help you .  I wish Id met with such as you before , said the burglar . Id have been a better man than I am .  Here the doctor entered , and Herbert gave place to him . The wound was discovered not to be serious , and , the bullet being extracted , the sufferer found relief . Herbert returned to bed , and this time , having no anxious thoughts to weigh upon his mind , he soon sank into a refreshing sleep , in which the fatigues and excitements of the day were completely forgotten .     CHAPTER XXI  HERBERTS REWARD   I owe the safety of my money to you , my brave boy , said Mr . Carroll , the next morning , as , after rising , he replaced the package of bank notes in his carpet-bag .  I only did my duty , said Herbert , but his face flushed with pleasure at the commendations bestowed upon him .  But in doing your duty , you displayed a courage and fidelity rare in one of your age .  I am glad you approve of my conduct , said Herbert .  If you continue to deserve as well of those who employ you , I am sure you will achieve success .  I hope so , sir , said our hero . I shall try to do my duty in whatever situation in life I may be placed .  What are your plans when you reach New York ?  I shall try to find a place in a store , or counting-room .  Have you friends in the city on whose influence you can rely to help you to such a situation as you desire ?  No , sir; I have only myself to look to .  Only yourself! It is a bold undertaking .  Dont you think I shall succeed ? asked Herbert , a little anxiously .  I do not doubt that you will succeed , after finding a place , but that is the difficulty .  I supposed there must be plenty to do in a great city like New York .  There is truth in what you say , but , nevertheless , many are led astray by it . There is , indeed , a great deal to do , but there are a great many ready to do it , and generally--I may say , always--the laborers exceed the work to be done .  Perhaps , said Herbert , many fail to get work , because they are particular what they do . If I can find nothing better to do , I will black boots .  With such a spirit , I think you will succeed . But , perhaps , I can smooth away some of the difficulties in your path . I know a firm in New York--connections of our family--to whom I will give you a letter of introduction . If they have no room for you in their house , they may influence someone else to take you .  I shall feel very much obliged to you for such a letter . It will do me a great deal of good , said Herbert , gratefully .  I will gladly write it , but now let us go down to breakfast .  After breakfast was over , they looked in upon the wounded man .  How do you feel this morning ? asked Herbert , going up to the bedside .  Rather stiff , but I am not in such pain as I was .  I am glad to hear it .  That is the gentleman I was going to rob ? said the burglar , looking in the direction of Mr . Carroll .  Yes .  Is he--did you say anything to him about not prosecuting me ? he asked , nervously .  Be under no apprehension , said Mr . Carroll , mildly . I do not care to punish you more than you have already been punished . I prefer that you should lead a better life .  I will try to do so , sir; but I was poor , and that made the temptation stronger .  I can easily believe it . Are you wholly without means ?  Nearly so .  Here , then , is a purse containing a hundred dollars . It will probably pay your expenses during your illness .  The wounded man looked up in surprise .  There aint many that would pay a man for trying to rob them , he said .  I do not pay you for that , said Mr . Carroll , but because I do not wish you to be subjected to a similar temptation again .  The wounded man , who , under different treatment would have been defiant and profane , seemed quite subdued by such unexpected kindness .  Well , sir , he said , all I can say is , that I am very much obliged to you , and I hope you will be rewarded for your kindness .  It is easier to lead men than to drive them , said Mr . Carroll , as they left the chamber . This man is rough , and not troubled much with a conscience , but harshness would make him still worse .  Yes , sir , said Herbert; I think you are right .  After breakfast they resumed their journey . In due time they reached Baltimore , and remained over night at a hotel . In the course of the succeeding day they arrived at Philadelphia , which was the termination of Mr . Carrolls journey . As the country through which they passed was unknown to Herbert , the journey was full of interest , but there was no adventure worth recording .  The time came when the two travelers were compelled to part .  If I were going to a hotel , Herbert , said Mr . Carroll , I would invite you to remain with me a day or two; but I shall proceed at once to the house of a friend , and I shall not feel at liberty to invite you .  Thank you , sir , said Herbert . I think it will be best for me to go on to New York at once . I have got my living to make , and I am anxious to get to work as soon as possible .  It is a praiseworthy feeling , said the old gentleman . Life lies before you . I have left nearly the whole of it behind me . I am drawing near the end of my journey . You are just at the beginning . I shall hope to meet you again , but , if not , be assured that I shall always remember , with pleasure , my young traveling companion .  Thank you , sir , said Herbert .  I shall not soon forget the essential service which you have rendered me , continued the old gentleman .  Dont think of it , sir , said Herbert , modestly , Anyone would have done the same thing in my place .  I am by no means sure of that . At any rate , the obligation remains . You must allow me to acknowledge it in some measure .  Mr . Carroll drew out his pocketbook and handed it to Herbert .  Will you oblige me , he said , by counting the bills in this pocketbook ?  Herbert did so .  There are sixty-five dollars , he said , passing it back .  Will you take out fifty dollars ?  Yes , sir--I have done it .  Thats the sum you will oblige me by keeping , said Mr . Carroll . I hope it may be of service to you .  You give me so much money ? said Herbert , in surprise .  It is but a very small sum , compared with that which you have saved me .  I dont think I ought to take so much , said Herbert , hesitating .  You need not hesitate , my young friend . I am blessed with abundant means , and very well able to part with it . Besides , it is only one per cent . of the money which you have been instrumental in saving me , and you are certainly entitled to as much as that .  I thank you very much for the gift , Mr . Carroll , said our hero , and still more for the kind manner in which you give it to me .  You accept it , then ? That is well , said the old gentleman , with satisfaction . There is one thing more . You remember that I spoke to you of a business firm in Pearl Street , New York , with the members of which I am acquainted . Last evening I prepared a letter of introduction to them for you . Here it is .  Thank you , sir , said Herbert . I was very fortunate in meeting with one so able and willing to assist me .  You are very welcome to all the help I am able to give you . I shall be very glad if your life shall be as prosperous as mine has been . I must trouble you to do me one more service . If you will find me a cab , I will go at once to my friends house .  No difficulty was experienced in obtaining a carriage . There was a cordial leave-taking , and Herbert once more found himself alone . But with rather more than sixty dollars in his pocket , he felt rich , and looked forward eagerly to his arrival in the great city , where he hoped to deserve and win success .     CHAPTER XXII  ROBBED IN THE NIGHT   Herbert entered the cars , and took a seat by the window . His small bundle , containing all the extra clothing he had been able to bring away from the inhospitable home of Mr . Holden , he placed in the seat beside him .  It was yet early , and there were but few persons in the car . But as the hour for starting approached , it gradually filled up . Still , the seat next to Herbert remained untaken .  At length a young man , apparently about nineteen , walked up the aisle , and , pausing , inquired , Is this seat engaged ?  No , said Herbert , at the same time removing his bundle .  Then , if you have no objection , Ill take possession .  He accordingly seated himself , and commenced a conversation .  Going to New York ? he asked .  Yes , said Herbert .  Do you live there ?  No; I have never been there before .  Are you going on a visit ?  No; I am going to live there; that is , if I can find anything to do .  Are you alone ?  Yes .  So am I . Suppose we hitch teams .  I dont understand .  Suppose we go to some hotel together . I have been there before , and can tell you where to go . Its awful dull being alone . I always like to pick up company .  Herbert hardly knew what to say to this proposition . He did not exactly like the appearance , or fancy the free and easy manners of his new acquaintance , but he felt lonely , and , besides , he hardly knew what excuse to make . He , therefore , gave his assent to the arrangement proposed .  Whats your name ? asked his new friend , familiarly .  Herbert Mason .  Mine is Greenleaf--Peter Greenleaf . Have you come from a distance ?  From Waverley , in Ohio , not far from Cincinnati .  I am from Philadelphia . Ive been in a store there , but I didnt like the style , and I concluded to go to New York . Theres more chance for a fellow of enterprise there .  What sort of a store were you in ?  Dry-goods store--Hatch & Macy . Old Hatch is a mean skinflint , and wouldnt pay me half what I was worth . I dont want to brag , but there wasnt a man in that store that sold as much as I did . And how much do you think I got ?  I dont know .  Only seven dollars a week . If I hadnt made something another way . I couldnt have paid my expenses .  I should think you might live on seven dollars a week .  This was before the war had increased the expenses of living .  Couldnt do it . Board cost me four dollars a week , and that only left three for other expenses . My cigars cost me nearly that . Then I wanted to go to the theater now and then , and , of course , I must dress like a gentleman . I tell you what , seven dollars a week didnt begin to do me .  How did you manage , then ?  Oh , I made so much more by banking .  By banking ? repeated Herbert , in astonishment .  Yes; only it was a faro bank . I used to pick up considerable that way , sometimes .  A faro bank! repeated Herbert , in dismay . Why , thats the same as gambling , isnt it ?  Well , whats the odds ? You take your chance , and you may win or lose . Its a pretty fair thing .  After this confession , Herbert became more than ever doubtful whether he should care to remain long in the company of his present companion .  Meanwhile , the cars were moving rapidly . Peter Greenleaf , as he called himself , talked volubly , and appeared to have a considerable familiarity with certain phases of life , the knowledge of which was not likely to have been very profitable to him . Still , Herbert was interested in his communications , though the opinion which he formed of him was far from favorable .  Where are you going to stop when you get to New York ? inquired Peter .  I dont know anything about the city . I suppose I shall have to go to a hotel first .  Suppose we go to Frenchs Hotel ?  Where is that ?  Near the park . Its on the European plan . You pay fifty cents a day for your rooms , and whatever you please for your meals .  I think I shall like that . I shall want to get into a boarding-house as soon as possible .  All right . Well take a room together at the hotel .  This arrangement was not to Herberts taste , but he did not care to offend his companion by objecting to it , so by his silence , he gave consent .  What are you going to do in New York ? he asked .  I shall look up a situation . I wont take less than fifteen dollars a week . A man of my experience ought to be worth that . Dont you think so ?  Yes , said Herbert , dubiously , though it occurred to him that if he were an employer , he would not be likely to engage such a clerk at any price . But it is rather fortunate , all things considered , that we are able to keep our thoughts to ourselves , otherwise , the complacency of our companions , and sometimes our own , would run the risk of being rudely disturbed .  In course of time the terminus of the road was reached , and , crossing over from Jersey City , Herbert found himself , for the first time in his life , in the noise and whirl of the great city .  And I am actually to live here , thought Herbert . I wonder what Mr . Holden would say if he knew where I was ? Uncertain as his prospects were , he felt very glad that he was out of the clutches of the petty despot , whose chief pleasure was to make him uncomfortable . Here , at least , the future was full of possibilities of good fortune; there , it was certain discomfort and little to hope for .  Where is the hotel you spoke of ? he asked , turning to Greenleaf .  Ill lead you to it .  They walked up to Broadway , then up by the Astor House , and across the park to the hotel .  Well go in and secure a room the first thing , he said .  They entered , Greenleaf taking the lead .  Show us a room with two beds , said Peter to the clerk .  A servant was summoned , and the room assigned to them was indicated .  Have you any baggage ? asked the clerk .  No , said Greenleaf , carelessly . Mine was checked through from Philadelphia . I shant send for it till morning .  Then I must ask you to pay in advance .  All right . Fifty cents , isnt it ?  Yes .  Mason , said Greenleaf , have you got a dollar about you ? Ive got nothing less than a ten .  Herbert drew out a dollar and paid for himself and his companion .  They were now shown up to a room on the third floor , which proved to be a very comfortable one , looking out on the street . Herbert was glad to get a chance to wash himself thoroughly after the dusty journey which he had just completed . This ceremony over , they went down to the restaurant connected with the hotel , and took a hearty meal . Greenleaf made an effort to have Herbert pay for both , but this time Herbert also had a bill to change . It was rather a suspicious circumstance , he thought , that Greenleaf , who had no bill smaller than a ten , paid for his meal out of a one-dollar bill .  After supper Greenleaf bought a couple of cigars , and offered Herbert one .  No , thank you , said our hero .  Dont you smoke ?  No .  Where have you been living all your life ? I couldnt get along without my cigar .  Dont you think it hurtful to a boy to smoke ?  I dont know about that . Im a man now , but Ive smoked ever since I was a boy . I think it does a fellow good .  But its expensive .  Yes , thats so . I expect Ive smoked a thousand dollars worth of cigars in the course of my life .  Dont you wish you had the money instead ?  Yes; I should rather like the money , but I shouldnt be half the man I am if I hadnt smoked . Its mostly milksops that dont smoke . Nothing personal , you know , Mason .  Of course not , said Herbert , smiling .  Better have a cigar .  No; I guess not .  Youll come to it in time . Ill smoke it for you , then .  After smoking , Greenleaf expressed his intention of going to the theater . Herbert preferred to go to bed early , feeling rather tired . He was kept awake at first by the noise of the horse-cars and the bustle of the street outside , as well as by the exciting thoughts that crowded upon him , suggested by his actual arrival in the city , where he hoped to make a place for himself by energy and industry . But at last he fell asleep .  He slept soundly through the night . But towards morning he had a dream in which Abner Holden figured . His old employer seemed to be approaching him with a smile of exultation , and was about to lay violent hands upon him , when he awoke . It was broad daylight , being already seven oclock in the morning . Herbert remembered where he was , and looked across the room for Greenleaf . But he was not visible . The bed was disarranged , and evidently had been slept in , but the occupant had risen .  I didnt think he was a fellow to rise early , thought Herbert . I suppose he is downstairs . I might as well get up , too .  Herbert jumped out of bed , and , going to the wash-stand , washed his face and hands . He then proceeded to dress .  I wonder Greenleaf didnt wake me up , he thought .  But the reason was too soon made evident . Happening to put his hand in the pocket where he usually kept his pocketbook , he was startled at finding it empty . Somewhat alarmed , he began to hunt round upon the floor , thinking it possible that it might have dropped out . But his search was vain . It was not to be found . He then examined carefully the remaining pockets , still without success .  It was not until this moment that a suspicion entered his mind concerning his companion .  Is it possible , he thought , that Greenleaf has been mean enough to strip me of my money ?  Herbert did not want to believe this . He disliked to think badly of anyone , and he still hoped it would prove otherwise . It was barely possible that Greenleaf had taken his money by way of playing a practical joke upon him , and he might now be downstairs , waiting to be amused at Herberts look of dismay when he discovered that he was penniless . Drowning men will catch at straws , and Herbert , in his trouble , tried to think this was probably the way it had happened .  Greenleaf is rather a hard case , according to his own account , he said to himself , but I cant believe he would be mean enough to rob me . I will go downstairs and see if I can find him .  Accordingly , leaving his chamber , he descended the staircase , and made his way to the office .  Herbert went up and spoke to the clerk who chanced to be inside .  Have you seen my roommate ? he asked .  What is the number of your room ?  No . ---- .  I remember now . He has gone .  Gone! echoed Herbert , in dismay .  Yes; didnt you know of it ?  He went away while I was asleep . How long since did he go ?  He came to the office two hours since , and said he should not require the room any longer .  Did he leave any message for me ?  No .  Did he say where he was going ?  No .  Such an expression of dismay and perplexity overspread Herberts face that the clerk could not help observing it .  Is anything wrong ? he asked .  Yes , said Herbert . He has robbed me of my pocketbook , containing all my money .  Whew! whistled the clerk . How much had you ?  About sixty dollars .  Youre unlucky , thats a fact . Have you nothing left ?  Just then it flashed across Herberts mind that when he had paid for his supper he had changed a five-dollar bill , and placed the balance , about four dollars and a half in his vest pocket . He at once felt in that pocket , and found it still there . Greenleaf had contented himself with the pocketbook .  I have a little left , he said .  He paid for his room in advance for another day , and went down to breakfast .     CHAPTER XXIII  A BUSINESS CALL   It was certainly a startling discovery for Herbert to make , that out of sixty dollars he had only four left , now that he had paid for another day at the hotel , and this small sum must be further diminished by the expense of a breakfast . Unfortunately , too , he was quite hungry , for his misfortune had not taken away his appetite .  I will make a good breakfast , at any rate , said Herbert , philosophically . Afterwards , I will consider what to do .  He ordered a substantial breakfast , which , even at the low prices of a dozen years ago , amounted to fifty cents , and did full justice to what was set before him .  After paying at the desk , he went outside .  It was a bright , sunshiny morning , and this , with the comfortable feeling produced by having eaten a good breakfast , gave him courage for the new career upon which he was about to enter .  While considering what he should do first , the thought of the letter given him by Mr . Carroll flashed upon him . He felt for it hastily , and was rejoiced to find that that was safe , at least . Greenleaf had not taken that away , fortunately .  He looked at the direction . It was addressed to  Messrs . Godfrey & Lynn ,  No . ---- Pearl St .  It was not sealed , and was probably meant to be read by Herbert . At any rate , our hero so concluded , and opened the letter , not without curiosity as to what Mr . Carroll had written about him . He knew it must be favorable , of course , but found it even more so than he anticipated .  Here it is:  MY DEAR MR . GODFREY: This letter will be handed you by a young friend of mine , by name Herbert Mason . My acquaintance with him has been brief , but he has been able , by his coolness and bravery , to do me a most important service , having saved me from being robbed of a large sum of money while acting as my escort from Ohio to Philadelphia . I have talked with him freely about his plans , and find that he will reach New York without friends , and with a very small sum of money , hoping before it is gone to secure a place in some counting-room , where he can make an honest living . I feel a strong interest in his success , and am persuaded that wherever he is placed , he will show rare capacity and fidelity . I wish it might be in your power to receive him into your own counting-room . But , of course , that must be according to your convenience . At any rate , may I rely on you to act a friendly part by my young friend , and to exert your influence toward procuring him a position elsewhere , if you cannot employ him yourself ? Anything that you may have it in your power to do for Herbert , I shall consider as a favor done to myself .  I have just left my daughter , who , with her family , is well . Sincerely , your friend ,  JAMES CARROLL .  That is a very kind letter , thought Herbert , gratefully . I hope it will do me good .  He decided to call and deliver it the same forenoon . If he had not been robbed of nearly the whole of his small capital , he would , first , have gone about the city , which was entirely new to him . But , with less than four dollars between himself and utter destitution , he felt that he had no time for sight-seeing . It was necessary that he should get to work as soon as possible .  He waited till ten oclock , thinking it possible that the heads of the firm might not reach the counting-room till about that time . It was now eight oclock only . He had two hours , therefore , to look about him .  Shine yer boots ? said a ragged urchin , approaching , with a suggestive look at his soiled shoes .  It occurred to Herbert that it would be best to look as well as possible when visiting Godfrey .  Ten cents .  Its too much , said Herbert , thinking how few dimes constituted his entire worldly wealth .  Well , five , then , said the bootblack , coming down to his regular price .  Do you get much to do ? asked our hero .  Some days I get considerable .  How much do you make ?  Pleasant days I makes a dollar , but when it rains , there aint much to do .  How much do you have to pay for sleeping ?  Six cents .  Six cents! repeated Herbert , in surprise . Where can you get lodged for that ?  At the lodgin house , corner of Fulton and Nassau Streets .  Well , thought Herbert , I neednt starve . If I cant get anything better to do , I can buy a box of blacking and a brush , and set up in business for myself .  To be sure , this would not be an agreeable occupation , but Herbert was bound to make a living by honest labor . If one avenue was closed to him , he must enter such as were open to him . He could not afford to be particular .  After his shoes were brushed , he crossed the park , and walked up Broadway . It was a wonderful sight to the country-bred boy , this gay thoroughfare , with its busy and bustling crowds , and its throngs of vehicles , never ceasing wholly , save at the dead hours of night . He thought to himself what a quantity of business there must be to do . Certainly , there must be room for one more worker . So , on the whole , the busy scene gave him courage , and he sauntered along as cheerfully as if he were not next-door to a beggar .  But at last the time came when he might safely seek out the gentleman to whom he had an introduction . Being a stranger in the city , he had to inquire for Pearl Street from a policeman , who answered his inquiry very civilly . He followed the direction , and found it at length . But the number of which he was in search was not so easily found , for he found the street meandered in a very perplexing way , so that at times he was not quite sure whether he was still in it , or had wandered from his way .  At last he found the place . It was a large , solid-looking building , of four stories in height . There were a number of boxes outside on the sidewalk . Inside , there was a large apartment occupying the entire first floor , with the exception of a room in the rear , which had been partitioned off for a counting-room . The partition was of glass , and , as he looked from the entrance , he could see a couple of high desks and a table .  Is this Godfrey & Lynns ? he asked of a porter at the entrance .  Yes , said the porter .  I want to see Mr . Godfrey .  I dont think hes in . You can go to the office and inquire .  Accordingly , Herbert passed down the length of the warehouse , and , pausing a moment before the door , he opened it , and entered .  There were two persons in the office . One was a thin-faced man , who sat on a high stool at one of the desks , making entries apparently in the ledger . This was the bookkeeper , Mr . Pratt , a man with a melancholy face , who looked as if he had lived to see the vanity of all things earthly . He had a high forehead naturally--made still higher by the loss of his front hair . Apparently , he was not a man to enjoy conviviality , or to shine on any festive occasion .  Besides Mr . Pratt , there was a boy , if we may take the liberty of calling him such , of about Herberts age . He was fashionably dressed , and his hair was arranged with exceeding care . In fact , as Herbert entered , he was examining the set of his necktie in a little hand-glass , which he had taken from his coat pocket . Not quite suiting him , he set himself to rearranging it .  Have you copied that bill , Thomas ? asked Mr . Pratt , looking up .  Not yet , sir .  You have been long enough about it . Put back that glass . You are quite too much troubled about your appearance .  Yes , sir .  If I didnt look any better than some people , said Thomas , sotto voce , I shouldnt look in a glass very often .  Herbert naturally concluded that Mr . Pratt was the man to whom his inquiries should be addressed .  I would like to see Mr . Godfrey , sir . he said .  He is out of the city .  Out of the city! repeated Herbert , disappointed . When will he be back ?  Nor till day after to-morrow .  Herberts countenance fell . In his reduced circumstances , he could hardly afford to wait two days . At his present rate of expenditure , he would be penniless by that time .  Is Mr . Lynn likely to be in soon ? he asked , thinking that perhaps he would do in Mr . Godfreys absence .  No; he is sick at home . He may not be here for a week . Perhaps , I can attend to your business , he added . What is it ?  I think , said Herbert , that I will wait till day after to-morrow , if you think Mr . Godfrey will be back then . I have a letter for him .  If its a business letter , you had better leave it .  It is a letter of introduction , said Herbert . I would rather present it in person .  Very well , and Mr . Pratt went back to his ledger .  Thomas looked critically at the boy who had a letter of introduction to Mr . Godfrey , and said to himself , He got his clothes from a country tailor , Ill bet a hat .     CHAPTER XXIV  FINDING A BOARDING PLACE   Herbert left the counting-room of Godfrey & Lynn , not a little depressed in spirits . The two days which must elapse before he could see Mr . Godfrey were to him a formidable delay . By that time his money would be almost exhausted . Then , suppose , which was very probable , Mr . Godfrey could do nothing for him immediately , but only hold out his promise of future assistance , how was he to live in the meantime ? After all , he might have to realize his thought of the morning , and join the ranks of the bootblacks . That was not a pleasant thought to a boy of his education . All labor is honorable , to be sure , but , then , some occupations are more congenial than others .  If Greenleaf had not robbed him so basely , he could have afforded to wait . He felt sore and indignant about that . Nobody likes to own that he has been victimized , but Herbert was obliged to confess to himself that such was the case with him .  He walked about rather aimlessly , feeling miserable enough . But , all at once , it occurred to him , Would it not be cheaper for him to take board by the week in some boarding-house ? Reckoning up , he found that his hotel bill would be three dollars and a half a week , while his meals , even if he were quite abstemious , would make as much more; in all , seven dollars . Surely , he could be boarded somewhere for less than that .  In the reading-room of the hotel he found a daily paper , and carefully ran his eye down the advertisements for boarders and lodgers . The following attracted his attention:  BOARDERS WANTED .--A few mechanics may obtain comfortable rooms and board at No . ---- Stanton Street , at three dollars per week .  This , be it remembered , was previous to the war , and before the price of board had doubled .  Three dollars a week! repeated Herbert . Less than half my present rate of expense . I must go at once and secure it .  He found the way to Stanton Street , and found that No . ---- was a shabby-looking house in a shabby neighborhood . But he could not afford to be fastidious . He accordingly stepped up without hesitation , and rang the bell , which emitted a shrill sound in reply .  A middle-aged woman , with a red handkerchief tied around her head , and a broom in her hand , opened the door and looked inquiringly at our hero .  Whats wanted ? she said .  I saw your advertisement for boarders , said Herbert .  Yes; I advertised in the paper this morning .  Will you let me see your rooms ?  Who are you looking for ?  Myself .  I dont know as youll be suited . My price is low , and I cant give first-class accommodations for three dollars .  No; I suppose not .  Come up , if you would like to see what Ive got .  The interior of the house was shabby like the outside , the oilcloth carpet faded , and the wall paper torn off in places . The stairs , too , were narrow and uncarpeted . All this Herbert observed , but he could not afford to be critical .  On the third floor , his guide threw open the door of a dark , little hall bedroom , meagerly furnished .  I could give you this room by yourself , she said , or a larger room with someone else .  I would rather be alone .  Thats the only single room I have . Will you take it ?  I think so , said Herbert , though he did not anticipate much enjoyment in such a poor place .  When do you want to come ?  To-morrow morning .  Very well . I shall expect a deposit , so that I may be sure the room is let .  How much ?  A dollar will do .  Herbert drew a dollar from his pocket , and handed it to Mrs . Morgan , for such , she informed him , was her name .  Then he went downstairs and out into the air again .  Well , he said to himself , Im sure of a home , such as it is , for a week . In that time something must turn up .  Examining his pocketbook he found that he had two dollars and a half left . Of that sum , two dollars must be reserved to pay the balance of his weeks board . Out of the remaining fifty cents he must pay for his meals until the next morning , when he would take possession of his new boarding place . He wished that he had proposed to come to breakfast , but it was too late now .  With such a small sum in hand , he could not afford to dine on the same magnificent scale as he had breakfasted , but he must be rigidly economical . He decided that the cheapest food he could buy was a five-cent loaf at some bakers . This would probably last him through the day , and might prove sufficient for breakfast also , since he would take a regular dinner , though he doubted , from what he had seen of the establishment in Stanton Street , whether it would be a very inviting repast . But it was the best he could afford , and that was all he need consider .  Late in the afternoon , it occurred to Herbert to wonder where , in the city , his Uncle Stanton lived . Not that he had any intention of applying to him for assistance , even if matters came to a crisis , but he felt a natural curiosity as to how his uncle was situated . He found the directory readily , and , turning to the letter S , ran down the list of names till he came to Stanton , Benjamin .  He learned that his uncles store was in the lower part of Broadway , while his house was in West Seventeenth Street , between Fifth and Sixth Avenues .  I should like to see what sort of a house Uncle Benjamin lives in , thought Herbert .  There was nothing to prevent his gratifying this wish , as he had plenty of time on his hands . If he had had more money , he would have taken the horse cars , but in his present circumstances this would be imprudent . He decided , as it was only five oclock , to take a leisurely walk up Broadway , noticing his uncles place of business on the way .  A few minutes brought him in front of the latter--an imposing-looking building , with all the appearance of belonging to a prosperous merchant . Appearances are deceitful , to be sure , and no doubt there are some merchants , as outwardly prosperous , who might profitably change places with their head clerks . But Herbert naturally judged from appearances , and he could not help contrasting in his mind his own condition with that of his uncles . But he was too manly to be despondent on this account , and thought rather , I am young and ready to work , Some time , if I am patient and work hard . I may be as well off as Uncle Benjamin . The thought of applying to him for assistance was as far off as ever .  He pursued his way uptown , finding it a longer walk than he anticipated , arriving at half-past five at Union Square . At the upper end he turned off , and went down Seventeenth Street .  Carefully noting the numbers , he at length found his uncles house . It was a handsome , substantial city mansion , and seemed appropriate as the residence of a rich New York merchant .  So my uncle lives here , thought Herbert , and there rose involuntarily in his mind the memory of the humble Western home where he and his mother had struggled against poverty , while his uncle , who was evidently so amply provided with the worlds goods , coldly held aloof , and forbore to offer the assistance which he could so well afford .  If I had a sister , I could never treat her like that , thought Herbert , indignantly . He would not help my mother . I will starve before I ask him to help me .  He paused a moment on the opposite side of the street to look at his uncles house . While he was standing there , a boy of about his own age , apparently , came down the street whistling , and ascended the steps of his uncles house .  I wonder if that is my cousin Tom , thought Herbert . He knew the names of his cousins from his mother , though he had never seen them .  While he looked , he was struck by something familiar in the appearance of this boy . Where had he seen him before ?  All at once it flashed upon him . It was the same boy he had seen in the counting-room of Godfrey He knew him by his dandified dress and his face , which he had noticed at the time .  This was certainly a strange coincidence , that his cousin , for it was doubtless he , should be the first boy he encountered after reaching New York . It would be still stranger if Mr . Godfrey should offer him employment , and he should find himself a clerk in the same office as the son of his rich uncle . But it was by no means certain that he would be lucky enough to obtain such employment . Therefore there was no need of wondering whether , under such circumstances , Tom would recognize him as a relation .  Herbert walked thoughtfully back , and on reaching his room ate the remainder of the loaf which he had purchased at the bakers in the morning . It was not a very luxurious repast , but his walk had given him an appetite , and he had no difficulty in disposing of all that was left .     CHAPTER XXV  GETTING A SITUATION   The next morning Herbert reported himself at his new boarding place . He found the fare very far from first-class , while his fellow-boarders appeared at the table mostly in shirt-sleeves , and were evidently workingmen . Our hero would have preferred a greater degree of neatness both in the table and in the guests , but he felt that he would be lucky , if he should find himself able to pay his expenses even here . He was not to be daunted by little annoyances , but looked for compensation in the future .  He waited impatiently for the next day , when Mr . Godfrey would return . Upon the success of the interview with him much depended .  At length it came , and Herbert once more set out for the warehouse on Pearl Street . He entered without question , and made his way to the counting-room . Looking through the glass door , he saw his cousin--whom he surveyed with new interest now that he knew the relationship--and the bookkeeper . But , besides these , there was an elderly gentleman , rather stout , with a pleasant face , the expression of which reassured him .  Is Mr . Godfrey in ? he asked , on entering , with a look of inquiry at the gentleman just described .  That is my name . What can I do for you ? said Mr . Godfrey , turning towards him .  I have a letter for you , sir , said Herbert , producing it from his pocket .  Mr . Godfrey held out his hand for it , and ran his eye rapidly over its contents .  So your name is Herbert Mason ? he said , raising his eyes after finishing it .  Yes , sir .  At the mention of this name , Tom Stanton , whose curiosity had led him to listen to the conversation , wheeled rapidly round on his stool and surveyed our hero with intense curiosity . He knew that Herbert Mason was the name of his cousin . Could it be possible that this boy was the cousin whom he had never seen ? A little later , and he was convinced of it .  You have just come from Ohio , I suppose ?  Yes , sir .  My friend , Mr . Carroll , writes me that you were instrumental in saving him from being robbed while acting as his escort to Philadelphia .  It wasnt worth mentioning , said Herbert modestly .  Mr . Godfrey noticed his modest tone , and it pleased him--modesty not being an unvarying characteristic of young America .  My friend refers to it as an important service . I should like to know the particulars . Mr . Carroll is a connection of mine , and I am naturally interested in all that relates to him .  In reply Herbert gave a brief , but clear and intelligent account of the attempted burglary , passing over his own achievement as lightly as possible . But it was easy to infer , even from the little he said , that he had acted with bravery and self-possession .  You behaved in a very creditable manner , said Mr . Godfrey , approvingly . Many boys would have lost their self-possession . You have come to New York in search of employment , Mr . Carroll writes me ?  Yes , sir .  I dont , of course , know how you were situated in Ohio , said the merchant , but as a general rule I think boys make a mistake in leaving the country for the city . Here the competition for work is sharp , and there is a surplus of laborers in every department of labor . Still , he proceeded , scanning Herberts earnest face , you look like a boy capable of making his way if an opportunity offers . You have but little money , Mr . Carroll writes .  I have lost nearly all I had , said Herbert , so that now I have very little left .  You have met with a loss ? Tell me about it . Indeed , I should be glad if you would confide to me freely your situation and hopes , and then I shall be better able to help you .  I am almost ashamed to tell you how I was taken in , said our hero . I suppose I ought to have been more prudent .  He recounted the manner in which Greenleaf had robbed him . Mr . Godfrey listened with interest , and so did Tom Stanton , who burst into a laugh when the narrative was concluded .  What are you laughing at , Thomas ? asked the merchant , rather sharply .  I was thinking how neatly he was taken in , said Tom , a little abashed .  I should apply a different word to it , said Mr . Godfrey . It appears to me the height , or rather the depth of meanness , to take advantage of a boys confidence , and defraud him so scandalously . How much money have you left , Herbert ?  Forty cents , sir .  Only forty cents to begin life with in a great city!  Yes , sir; I have paid my board in advance for a week .  Where do you board ?  In Stanton Street .  Tom turned up his nose at the name of this street , which he knew was very far from fashionable , but this demonstration our hero did not observe .  What board do you pay ?  Three dollars a week , sir .  A poor place , probably .  Yes , sir , but I could afford no better .  You are sensible to accommodate yourself to circumstances . Well , my young friend , it appears that you cant wait long for employment . Mr . Carroll has asked me to do something for you , and I am disposed to oblige him , not wholly for his sake , but partly for your own , for you seem to me a very modest and sensible boy . Mr . Pratt , do we need another boy ?  No , sir , I dont think we do .  Well , business will be brisker by and by . I think you can find a little for this young man to do in the meantime . He can go to the post office , and I believe I have a little extra writing to be done . Pass him a pen , and let him give us a specimen of his handwriting .  Fortunately , Herbert was a handsome writer , and this went a considerable way in his favor .  Very neat , said the merchant . By the way , Herbert , I suppose , of course , you know nothing of French ?  Yes , sir , I can read it pretty well .  Indeed! said Mr . Godfrey , surprised . Then you can be of service to me , that is , if you know it well enough . I received , this morning , a letter from a silk house at Lyons , a part of which I dont quite understand . The fact is , my French is rather poor . Do you think you could help me translate it ?  If you will show me the letter , I will try , sir .  The merchant took a letter from the table before him and handed it to Herbert .  Our hero ran his eye rapidly over it , and then rendered it into English in a clear and grammatical way .  Bless me , youre quite a scholar , said Mr . Godfrey . I understand now . Youve made it all plain . Where did you learn so much French ?  My father taught me , sir . He also taught me Latin .  Indeed , I congratulate you on possessing so good an education . Latin , however , isnt so much in my way . I havent many Latin correspondents .  I suppose not , sir , said Herbert , laughing .  Still , it does no harm to know something of it .  Tom Stanton had listened with considerable surprise , mingled with mortification , to what had passed . It appeared then , that his country cousin , whom he had looked upon as a country boor , was his superior in education , and , as Tom secretly knew , in courage . And now he was going to be his fellow-clerk . He felt jealous and angry , fearing that Herbert , who appeared to be high in favor already , would eclipse him in the office .  How much can you live upon economically ? asked the merchant .  I know little of the city , said Herbert . You can judge better than I , sir .  You pay three dollars a week board . Youll need double that amount . Mr . Pratt , you may pay him six dollars a week . He will come to work to-morrow morning , and you may pay him Saturday , as if it was a whole week .  Thank you , sir , said Herbert , gratefully . You are very kind .  Do your duty , my young friend , and I shall be satisfied .  Tom Stanton listened in indignant surprise . He only got four dollars a week , and here was a country boy placed over his head . He was imprudent enough to give expression to his feelings .  Wont you give me six dollars a week , also ? he said .  Why should I ?  Dont I deserve as much as he ?  Perhaps you do . But I dont give it to Herbert because he earns it , for it is not likely that he will do so at present . But he has no other resources . You have a comfortable home , and are not obliged to pay for your board out of your wages .  No , I hope not , said Tom .  Therefore you do not need as much as he does . You are not entitled to this explanation , but I give it , nevertheless , that you may know my motives .  Tom did not reply , feeling that it would be imprudent to do so , but he bent sullenly to his work , by no mans satisfied with the explanation . He began to feel a dislike for his cousin , and determined to injure him , if he could , in the estimation of the firm . It would have been satisfactory if he could have looked down upon him as an inferior , but that was not easy .  I hope the fellow wont find out the relationship between us , he said to himself . Hed be calling me Cousin Tom all the time , and I dont care about owning a cousin that lives in Stanton Street .  Tom need not have troubled himself . Herbert had no idea of claiming relationship , though , as we know , he was fully aware of its existence .     CHAPTER XXVI  A FAMILY COUNCIL   As soon as he was released from business , Tom Stanton hurried home to impart the unexpected intelligence that his cousin Herbert had arrived in the city . As might be expected , the news gave no particular pleasure in the Stanton homestead .  Did you tell him who you were , Thomas ? asked his mother .  Catch me doing it! said Tom . I aint quite a fool . I dont care about owning any pauper relations .  He isnt a pauper , said Mr . Stanton , who , hard man of the world as he was , could not forget that Herbert was the son of his sister .  Hes the next door to it , said Tom , carelessly .  Thomas is right , said Mrs . Stanton . You may depend upon it , Mr . Stanton , that when this boy finds you out , he will apply to you for assistance .  Possibly he may .  I hope you wont be such a fool as to encourage him in his application .  If he were in actual distress , my dear , said Mr . Stanton , I should feel that I ought to do something .  Then youd allow yourself to be imposed upon , thats all Ive got to say . There is no need of his being in distress . He is a stout boy , and capable of earning his own living .  He might get sick , suggested Mr . Stanton , who was not so hard-hearted as his wife .  Then let him go to the hospital . Its provided for such cases .  Is Herbert good-looking ? asked Maria , with interest .  He wont get a prize for his beauty , said Tom , disparagingly .  Is he homely ?  No , said Tom , reluctantly . I suppose hell pass; but hes countrified . He hasnt got any style , and he glanced complacently at his own reflection in a mirror , for Tom was vain of his personal appearance , though by no means as good-looking as Herbert . In fact , he was compelled secretly to confess this to himself , and for this reason was more than ever disposed to view his cousin with prejudice .  I should like to see Herbert , said Maria , who had her share of female curiosity , and thought it would be pleasant to have a cousin to escort her round .  Perhaps Id better invite him round to dinner tomorrow , said Thomas , sarcastically .  I wish you would .  Thomas will do no such thing! said Mrs . Stanton , decidedly . Its my opinion that the less notice we take of him the better . Your father is in good circumstances , to be sure , but whatever he is able to do , ought , of right , to go to his own family . We dont want any poor relations coming here to get their living out of us .  Just my sentiments , mother , said Tom Stanton , approvingly .  It doesnt seem quite right , said Mr . Stanton , uncomfortably , to neglect my sisters child .  Dont make yourself ridiculous with your scruples , Mr . Stanton , said his wife . Its the boys duty to take care of himself . It would only do him harm , and lead to false expectations , if we allowed him the run of the house .  Besides , said Tom , I shouldnt want to have Tom Paget and Percy Mortimer , and other fellows that I associate with , ask me who he is , and have to tell them that he is my cousin .  This argument had considerable weight with Mr . Stanton , who was anxious to elevate himself in society , and looked with complacency upon the school acquaintances Tom had formed with the scions of distinguished families .  Well , said he , rising from the table , let it be as you will . We wont go out of our way to invite the boy here , but if he presents himself , as he doubtless will , we must take a little notice of him .  I dont see why he couldnt have stayed in the country , said Mrs . Stanton . It was the best place for him .  Of course , it was , said Tom .  He could have had no other object than to seek us out , and see what he could get out of us . For my part , I would advise you to recommend him to go back .  He has secured a place , it seems , and would not be likely to give it up .  Its a great pity he should have got into the same counting-room with Tom . He will presume on the relationship as soon as he finds it out .  Mrs . Stanton need not have been alarmed , for Herbert was too high-spirited to seek an intimacy where he had reason to think it would be disagreeable . But his aunt knew nothing of him , and judged him by herself .  Hes there , and it cant be helped , said Mr . Stanton .  At any rate , if he does stay in the city , persisted Mrs . Stanton , I hope youll give him to understand that he neednt call here more than once in three months . That is as much as he can expect .  After all , he is my sisters son , said Mr . Stanton . I cant feel that this would be quite kind in us .  Leave it to me , then . If youre too soft-hearted , Mr . Stanton , I will take all the responsibility , and the blame , if there is any .  Well , I think youve said enough on the subject , said her husband . Tom , run upstairs and bring me a cigar . You know where I keep the cigar box .  Youd better send a servant , father , said Tom , coolly .  It appears to me you are getting lazy , Thomas , said his father .  Thomas is right , said Mrs . Stanton . What do we keep servants for but to run errands ?  Still , Tom might have obliged me in such a little matter .  You shouldnt have asked him , Mr . Stanton . You seem to forget that we are not living in the style of half a dozen years ago . You should adapt yourself to circumstances .  Mr . Stanton said no more , but sent a servant in Toms place . But he could not help thinking that the outward prosperity for which he was striving was not without its drawbacks , since it compelled him to look to servants for the most ordinary services .  The next morning Tom went to the counting-room , fully expecting that Herbert would claim relationship as soon as he discovered his name . While he would be compelled to admit it , he determined to treat Herbert with such a degree of coolness that he would take the hint , and keep his distance .  When he arrived at the counting-room , Herbert was already there , and Mr . Pratt also .  Good-morning , said Herbert .  Morning , muttered Tom .  This is Thomas Stanton , your fellow-clerk , said Mr . Pratt , the bookkeeper . I believe you have not been introduced .  Now for it , thought Tom .  But rather to his surprise , Herbert made no demonstration , but merely bowed slightly .  What does it mean ? thought Tom , a little perplexed . Is it possible that he is not my cousin , after all ?  I think you came from Ohio ? inquired Tom , impelled by his curiosity to ask the question .  Yes , said Herbert .  Why didnt you stay there ? Couldnt you make a living there ? asked Tom , not over-politely .  Probably I might , said Herbert , quietly .  Then I think you should have stayed there .  Which do you like best , the city or the country ? asked our hero .  The city .  So do I .  But theres a difference . I have always lived in the city .  I suppose boys often do come from the country to the city , said Herbert . Was your father born in the city ?  No , said Tom , glancing keenly at Herbert , to see if he meant anything by the question .  Then it seems he must have preferred the city to the country .  Tom had his share of curiosity . He knew that it would be better not to pursue this subject further if he wished his cousin to remain ignorant of the relationship between them . Still , he was anxious to know what Herberts actual knowledge was , and whether he would be likely to avail himself of it . He was therefore tempted to say , I suppose you have no relations in the city ?  What makes you think I havent ? asked Herbert , looking at Tom rather peculiarly .  I dont think anything about it . I only asked , said Tom , a little confused .  Yes , I have an uncle in the city , said Herbert , quietly .  Oh , indeed , said Tom .  He said nothing more , for he felt that he might betray his knowledge of the relationship unintentionally . Herberts manner left him as much in the dark as ever .  Mr . Pratt set Herbert to work on some writing , and Tom , also , was soon busy . After a while Mr . Godfrey came in .  Good-morning , Herbert , he said , pleasantly , offering his hand . So Mr . Pratt has set you to work , has he ?  Yes , sir .  I think we shall find enough for him to do , eh , Mr . Pratt ?  Yes , sir , I think so , said the bookkeeper , who perceived that Herbert was in favor , and it was as well to fall in with his employer .  Thats well . How do you like your boarding place , Herbert ?  It isnt a very nice one , sir , but it is as good a one as I have a right to expect for the money I pay .  Come round and dine with us to-night , said the merchant . Mrs . Godfrey will be glad to see you . Ill give you my street and number .  Thank you , sir , said Herbert . I shall be glad to accept your kind invitation .  Tom listened to this invitation with envy . Mr . Godfrey occupied a high social position . Moreover , he had a pretty daughter , whom he , Tom , had met at dancing school , and he would have been very glad to receive the invitation which had been extended to that beggar , Herbert , as he mentally styled him .     CHAPTER XXVII  AT THE CONCERT   Herbert felt a little diffident about accepting his employers invitation to dinner . Brought up in the country in comparative poverty , he felt afraid that he should show , in some way , his want of acquaintance with the etiquette of the dining table . But he had a better than ordinary education , and , having read diligently whatever books he could get hold of , possessed a fund of general information which enabled him to converse intelligently . Then his modest self-possession was of value to him , and enabled him to acquit himself very creditably .  Julia Godfrey , the merchants only daughter , was a lively and animated girl , a year or two younger than Herbert . She had been the belle of the dancing school , and Tom Stanton , among other boys , had always been proud to have her for a partner . She , however , had taken no particular fancy to Tom , whose evident satisfaction with himself naturally provoked criticisms on the part of others . Of this , however , Tom was unconscious , and flattered himself that his personal appearance was strikingly attractive , and was quite convinced that his elaborate and gorgeous neckties must attract admiration .  Julia awaited the advent of her fathers young guest with interest , and her verdict was favorable . He was , to be sure , very plainly dressed , but his frank and open face and pleasant expression did not need fine clothes to set them off . Julia at once commenced an animated conversation with our hero .  Werent you frightened when you saw the robber ? she asked , for her father had told her of Herberts adventure with the burglar .  No , said Herbert , I did not feel afraid .  How brave you must be ? said Julia , with evident admiration .  There was no need of my being frightened , said Herbert , modestly . I was expecting him .  I know I should have been frightened to death , said Julia , decidedly .  You are a girl , you know , said Herbert . I suppose it is natural for girls to be timid .  I dont know but it is , but I am sure it is not natural to all boys to be brave .  Herbert smiled .  I was out in the country , one day , walking with Frank Percy , proceeded Julia , when a big , ugly-looking dog met us . Frank , instead of standing by , and defending me , ran away as fast as his feet could carry him . I laughed at him so much about it that he doesnt like to come near me since that .  How did you escape ? asked Herbert , with interest .  I saw there was no use in running away , so I patted him on the head , and called him Poor dog , though I expected every minute he was going to bite me . That calmed him down , and he went off without doing any harm .  Herbert found Mrs . Godfrey to be a pleasant , motherly-looking lady , who received him kindly . He felt that he should like it very much if she was his aunt , instead of Mrs . Stanton , whom he had never seen , and did not think he should care about meeting .  What do you think of Tom Stanton ? asked Julia , Of course , you know him--the other boy in pas counting-room .  I am not very well acquainted with him yet , said Herbert , evasively , for he did not care to say anything unfavorable of Tom . Do you know him ?  Yes , he used to go to the same dancing school with me last winter .  Then you know him better than I do .  I dont like him much , said Julia . Hes always thinking of himself and his neckties . He always came to dancing school in a different necktie; to let us know how many he had , I suppose . Didnt you notice his necktie ?  It was pretty large , I thought , said Herbert , smiling .  Yes , hes fond of wearing large ones .  I am afraid you are talking uncharitably , Julia , said her mother , mildly . Girls , you know , are sometimes fond of dress .  So the conversation drifted on to other topics . Julia , at first , addressed our hero as Mr . Mason , until he requested her to call him Herbert , a request which she readily complied with . They were soon on excellent terms , and appeared to be mutually pleased .  Young people , said Mr . Godfrey , after dinner , there is to be an attractive concert at the Academy of Music this evening . I secured seats this morning for four . Suppose we all go ?  I shall be delighted , for one , papa , said Julia . You will like to go , Herbert , wont you ?  Very much , said our hero .  Then you can escort me , while papa and mamma walk together .  Herbert felt that this arrangement would be very agreeable , so far as he was concerned . It was , in fact , adopted , and the four paired off together , as Julia had suggested , Julia amusing Herbert by her lively remarks .  Entering the hall , they followed the usher to their seats , which were eligibly located only a few rows back from the stage .  Just behind them sat a party , among whom the new arrivals produced quite a sensation . Not to keep the reader in suspense , that party consisted of Mr . and Mrs . Stanton , Tom and Maria . There was but slight acquaintance between the two families , as Mr . Godfreys stood higher , socially , than Mr . Stantons . The gentlemen , however , had a bowing acquaintance , and the young people had met at dancing school .  Why , theres Mr . Godfrey and his family , Tom , said Maria , turning towards her brother . Whos that boy with them ? Julia hasnt got any brother , has she ?  Tom had watched the entrance of the party with lively dissatisfaction . That his beggarly cousin should appear in public on such intimate terms with Julia Godfrey , to whom he himself had paid attention , but without any special encouragement , struck him as particularly mortifying .  Mr . Godfreys son! he said , disdainfully . That boy is Herbert Mason .  Our cousin ? asked Maria , with interest . Ma , did you hear ? she whispered , eagerly . That boy in front of us is Cousin Herbert .  That boy with the Godfreys ? said Mrs . Stanton , in surprise .  Yes , hes talking with Julia now .  Are you sure ? Who told you ?  Tom .  Is it true , Tom ?  Yes , said Tom , frowning .  What could have induced the Godfreys to bring him along ? said Mrs . Stanton , who was no better pleased than Tom at the social success of the poor relation .  Hes quite good-looking , said Maria .  Nonsense , said her mother , sharply . He has a very countrified look .  The news was communicated to Mr . Stanton , who looked with interest at his sisters son , whom he had not seen since he was a very young child . He fervently wished him back again in Ohio , where he might conveniently forget his existence . Here in New York , especially since an unlucky chance , as he considered it , had brought him into the same counting-room as his son , it would be difficult to avoid taking some notice of him . But , so far as pecuniary assistance was concerned , Mr . Stanton determined that he would give none , unless it was forced upon him . Had he known our hero better , he would have been less alarmed .  With all his prejudices , Mr . Stanton could not help confessing that Herbert was a boy of whom any uncle might be proud . Though plainly dressed , he did not seem out of place at a fashionable concert , surrounded by well-dressed people .  It must not be supposed that Herbert was left in ignorance of the vicinity of the only relations he had in the city .  Theres Tom Stanton , just behind you , with his father and mother and sister , whispered Julia .  Herbert turned his head slightly . He was desirous of seeing what his uncle and aunt were like . His uncle met his gaze , and turned uncomfortably away , appearing not to know him , yet conscious that in his affected ignorance he was acting shabbily . Mrs . Stanton did not flinch , but bent a cold gaze of scrutiny upon the unwelcome nephew . Tom looked supercilious , and elevated his pug nose a trifle . Maria , only , looked as if she would like to know her cousin .  It was only a hasty glance on Herberts part , but it brought him to a rapid conclusion that he would not claim relationship . If any advances were made , they must come from the other side .  Tom fidgeted in his seat , watching with ill-concealed vexation the confidential conversation which appeared to be going on between Julia and his cousin .  What she can see in that boor , I cant imagine , he said to himself .  Moreover , though Julia had looked around , she had not deigned any recognition of himself , and this hurt his pride . He finally determined to overlook the neglect , and address her , which he could readily do , as he sat almost directly behind her .  Good-evening , Miss Julia , he said , familiarly , bending forward .  Oh , good-evening , Mr . Stanton , said Julia , coldly , just turning slightly . Herbert , isnt that a beautiful song ?  She calls him Herbert , said Tom , in scornful disgust . I wonder if she knows he is nothing but a beggar ?  How are you enjoying the concert , Miss Julia ? he continued , resolved not to take the rebuff .  Very well , said Julia . By the way , she continued , with a sudden thought , I believe you are acquainted with Mr . Mason .  Herbert , upon this , bowed pleasantly , but Tom said , in rather a disagreeable tone , I know Mr . Mason slightly .  Oh , said Julia , arching her eyebrows , I thought you were both in papas counting-room .  We shall know each other better by and by , said Herbert , smiling .  Tom did not appear to hear this , but tried to keep up the conversation with Julia , desiring to have it appear that they were intimate friends; but the young lady gave brief replies , and finally , turning away , devoted herself once more to Herbert , much to Toms disgust . In fact , what he saw made Tom pass a very unpleasant evening , and when , on their return home , Maria suggested that Julia had taken a fancy to Herbert , he told her to mind her own business , which Maria justly considered a piece of rudeness wholly uncalled for .     CHAPTER XXVIII  PETER GREENLEAF AGAIN   Notwithstanding he was receiving a salary larger than is usually paid boys of his age , Herbert felt cramped for the want of money . Six dollars a week would have paid his expenses comfortably , if he had been well provided to begin with . But all the clothing he had , besides what he wore , he had brought with him in a small bundle , the greatest part having been left in his trunk at the house of Abner Holden . He often wished that he could have them with him , but , of course , this wish was vain . Indeed , Mr . Holden , when the conviction was forced upon him that there was no chance of recovering his bound boy , quietly confiscated the trunk and its contents; and this , to some extent , consoled him for the departure of the owner .  Herbert found himself sadly in need of underclothing; and , of course , his only suit , from constant wear , was likely to deteriorate rapidly . He saved all the money he could from his weekly wages toward purchasing a new one , but his savings were inconsiderable . Besides , he needed a trunk , or would need one , when he had anything to put in it .  If I only had that money Greenleaf stole from me , I should be all right , he said to himself , after long and anxious thought on the great question of ways and means . I dont see how I can save up more than two dollars a week out of my wages , and it will take a long time for that to amount to much .  There certainly did not appear to be much chance of saving more . His boarding place was as cheap as he could obtain , or , if there were cheaper anywhere , they would probably be also poorer , and our hero felt that Mrs . Morgans was as poor as he should be able to endure .  He was rather mortified , too , at the poverty of his wardrobe . Mrs . Morgan asked him one day , When is your trunk coming ? and Herbert was obliged to own , with some shame , that he had none . The landlady looked surprised , but he had no explanation to offer .  I suppose I shall have to wait till my wages are raised , thought Herbert , with a little sigh . This , he reflected , would not be very soon , as he had started with a salary greater than he was likely to earn , as Mr . Godfrey had said .  But relief was nearer than he anticipated .  One day , as he was walking up the Bowery , he saw , at a little distance in front of him , a figure which he well remembered . The careless , jaunty step and well-satisfied air were familiar to him . In short , it was Peter Greenleaf , who had played so mean a trick upon him at the hotel .  Herberts heart beat quick with excitement , mingled with pleasure . He felt a natural indignation against this young man , who had cheated him so remorselessly , and left him , indifferent to his fate , alone and almost penniless in a strange city .  What should he do ?  Close behind him was a policeman slowly pacing his regular round . Herbert went up to him , and , pointing to Greenleaf , rapidly recounted his grievances .  It was a mean trick , said the policeman , who was a favorable specimen of his class . Is this the first time you have seen him ?  Yes .  Tell me what you want to do .  I want to get my money back .  Probably he has spent it . How long since he robbed you ?  Three weeks .  Not much chance , then . Probably his pockets empty , unless hes fleeced somebody else in the meantime . However , its as well to see what can be done . Now , Ill tell you how to act . Go up to him boldly , and demand your money . If he bluffs you off , call me .  All right , said Herbert .  He hastened his step , and , advancing , tapped Greenleaf on the shoulder .  Greenleaf turned . When he recognized Herbert , he looked surprised and disconcerted . But he had plenty of assurance , and quickly determined upon his course . Assuming a stolid look , he said: Well , my lad , who are you; and what do you want ?  You know who I am , well enough , said Herbert , angrily .  Do I ? Then Im uncommonly forgetful . I havent any recollection of your interesting countenance , he said , with a sneer .  I suppose you dont want to remember me , Mr . Greenleaf , said Herbert .  Greenleaf! You are thinking of somebody else . My names Thompson .  Your name was Greenleaf when you stopped with me at Frenchs Hotel , said Herbert , sturdily .  Youre crazy , I fancy , said Greenleaf , shrugging his shoulders . I never stopped at the hotel you mention , in my life .  Wheres the money you took from me ? demanded Herbert , who felt convinced of Greenleafs identity , in spite of his denial .  What are you talking about ? said Greenleaf , assuming a look of surprise .  You went off before I was awake , with more than fifty dollars of mine .  Do you mean to insult me ? said Greenleaf , drawing himself up . Ive a great mind to knock you over!  Mr . Greenleaf , said Herbert , firmly , either return my money , or as much as you have got left , or I will call a policeman .  Just what I shall do , myself , unless you stop this nonsense , said Greenleaf , angrily; but not without a sensation of uneasiness , as it struck his mind that Herbert might really intend to do what he had said .  Once more , will you give up that money ? said Herbert , firmly .  Stand out of the way , said Greenleaf , if you know what is best for yourself!  He was about to push by , thrusting Herbert roughly out of the way , when our hero turned , and his look summoned the policeman , who hastened to the spot .  Give this boy his money , he said , authoritatively . I know all about your little game . Its up now . Unless you hand over your plunder , you must go with me .  Greenleaf changed color , and was evidently alarmed .  Ive got nobodys money , except my own , he said .  Come along , then , said the officer , taking him by the arm .  Stop a minute , said he , hurriedly , finding that matters had come to a crisis . If I give up what I have , will you let me go ?  Well , that depends on how much you have .  Ive got twenty dollars .  Herbert was about to say that this would do , but the policeman shook his head .  Wont do , said he . Come along .  After a little haggling , Greenleaf produced forty dollars , which Herbert pocketed , with much satisfaction .  Now go along , and mind you dont try any more such games .  Greenleaf needed no second permission to be gone . He feared that the officer might change his mind , and he might , after all , be consigned to the station house .  Thank you , said Herbert , gratefully . I needed the money badly . I shouldnt have recovered it but for you .  Take better care of it next time , said the officer , not unkindly . Take care not to trust a stranger too easily . Better take my advice , and put it in a savings bank .  I shall be obliged to use most of it , said Herbert . What I dont need , I will put in the bank .  The recovery of so much of his lost money seemed to Herbert quite a lucky windfall . He went at once to a trunk store , and , for five dollars , purchased a good , durable trunk , which he ordered sent home to his lodgings . Fifteen dollars more he invested in necessary underclothing , and this left him one-half of the money for future use . Besides this he had six dollars , which , in three weeks , he had saved from his wages . With this sum , and the articles he had purchased , he felt quite rich , and returned to the counting-room--this happened during the hour given him for dinner--in unusually good spirits . He had other reasons for encouragement . He was getting accustomed to his duties at the counting-room . Mr . Godfrey always treated him kindly , and had called upon him again that very morning to assist him in translating a French letter , complimenting him , at the same time , upon his scholarship .  Ill do my best , thought Herbert . Try and Trust , thats my motto . I think it will bring me success .  But even while he spoke , an unforeseen danger menaced him .     CHAPTER XXIX  SPARRING   After the concert , Tom Stanton took even a greater dislike to his cousin than before . To say that he was in love with Julia Godfrey would be rather ridiculous , considering his youth . Even if he had been older , Tom cared too much about himself to fall in love with another . But Julia had been a belle among the children of her own age at the dancing school , and there was considerable rivalry among the boys--or , I should , perhaps , say young gentlemen--for the honor of her notice . Tom desired it , because it would give him a kind of distinction among his fellows . So , though he was not in love with Julia , he was jealous when she showed favor to anyone else . But this feeling was mild compared with that he experienced when Julia bestowed her notice upon his penniless cousin . That Herbert should be preferred to himself , he thought , not only showed great lack of taste on the part of the young heiress , but was a grievous wrong to himself .  I cant understand how girls can be such fools , thought Tom , as that evening , after returning from the concert , he surveyed his rather perturbed face in the mirror surmounting his bureau . I wouldnt have believed Julia Godfrey would stoop to notice such a pauper .  Then a cheerful thought came to him . Perhaps she was only trying to rouse his jealousy . He had heard of such things . But , if so , why should she choose such a beggar as Herbert to practice her arts upon ?  Certainly , to an unprejudiced observer , such a thought would never have suggested itself . The cool indifference with which Julia had treated Tom did not appear to argue any such feeling as would lead to the attempt to rouse his jealousy . But , then , Tom was not an unprejudiced observer , and considered his personal attractions such that any girl might appreciate them .  When he arrived at the counting-room the next morning , he found Herbert already there . Indeed , our hero was very particular to be punctual in his attendance , while Tom was generally at least a quarter of an hour behind time .  I saw you at the concert last evening , Mason , said Tom , who wanted to get a chance to say something disagreeable .  Yes , I was there , said Herbert . You sat in the row just behind us .  Yes . I suppose you were never at a concert before .  Not in New York .  Mr . Godfrey was very kind to take you .  That was what Herbert thought himself . But as Tom expressed it , there was something in his tone which implied a conviction of Herberts social inferiority , which our hero did not like .  I have found Mr . Godfrey very kind , he said , briefly .  There are not many employers who would invite a boy in your position to a concert with his family , said Tom .  I believe my position is the same as yours , said Herbert , nettled .  I dont see it , said Tom , haughtily . Will you explain yourself ?  I believe we are both in Mr . Godfreys employ , said Herbert .  Oh , yes , so far as that goes . But I am the son of a rich man , said Tom , pompously .  Herbert might have replied that he was the nephew of a rich man , but he had no disposition to boast of his relationship to his cousins family .  I dont see that that makes any difference , said Herbert .  Dont you ? Well , I do .  We are both boys in Mr . Godfreys employ .  Thats true , but then , he took you out of pity , you know .  Toms tone as he said this was very aggravating , and Herberts face flushed .  I dont know anything of the sort , he retorted .  No , I suppose you dont consider it in that light , said Tom , carelessly; but , of course , it is clear enough to others . Where would you have been , if Mr . Godfrey hadnt given you a place ? Blacking boots , probably , among the street ragamuffins .  Perhaps I might , said Herbert , quietly , if I couldnt have got anything better to do .  Its a very genteel occupation , sneered Tom .  I dont think it is , said Herbert , but its an honest one .  You may have to take it yet .  Perhaps so . So may you .  Do you mean to insult me ? demanded Tom , haughtily , his face flushing .  I only said to you the same thing you said to me . If its an insult on one side , it is on the other .  You seem to forget that our circumstances are very different , said Tom .  They are just now , so far as money goes . I get a larger salary than you .  Tom was very much incensed at this remark , being aggrieved by the fact that Herbert received more than he .  I didnt mean that , said he . Of course , if Mr . Godfrey chooses to give away money in charity , it is none of my business . I dont need any charity .  Mr . Godfrey pays me for my services , said Herbert . If he pays me too liberally now , I hope to make it up to him afterward .  You seemed to be very intimate with Julia Godfrey last evening , said Tom , unpleasantly .  I found her very pleasant .  Yes; she is very kind to take notice of you .  I suppose the notice you have taken of me this morning is meant in kindness , said Herbert , thinking his cousin very disagreeable .  Yes , of course , being in the same counting-room , I think it right to take some notice of you , said Tom , condescendingly .  I am very much obliged to you , said Herbert , sarcastically .  But theres one piece of advice I should like to give you , proceeded Tom .  What is that ? inquired Herbert , looking his cousin in the face .  Dont feel too much set up by Julia Godfreys notice . She only took notice of you out of pity , and to encourage you . If you had been in her own position in society--  Like you , for instance!  Yes , like me , said Tom , complacently , she would have been more ceremonious . I thought I would just mention it to you , Mason , or you might not understand it .  It was only natural that Herbert should be provoked by this elaborate humiliation suggested by Tom , and his cousins offensive assumption of superiority . This led him to a retort in kind .  I suppose that is the reason she took so little notice of you , he said .  Tom was nettled at this statement of a fact , but he answered in an off-hand manner , Oh , Julia and I are old friends . Ive danced with her frequently at dancing school .  Herbert happened to remember what Julia had said of his cousin , and was rather amused at this assumption of intimacy .  I am much obliged to you for your information , said Herbert , though I am rather surprised that you should take so great an interest in my affairs .  Oh , youre new in the city , and I know all the ropes , said Tom . I thought I might as well give you a friendly hint .  I am lucky in having such a friend , said Herbert , and will take the advice as it was given .  Here the bookkeeper entered , and , soon after , Mr . Godfrey made his appearance .  I hope you had a pleasant evening , Herbert , he said , kindly .  Very pleasant , sir; thank you , said Herbert , in a very different tone from the one he had used in addressing Tom .  I believe I saw you , also , at the concert , Thomas , said Mr . Godfrey .  Yes , sir , said Tom . I am very fond of music , and attend all the first-class musical entertainments .  Indeed ? said Mr . Godfrey , but this was all the reply he made .  My daughter insists that I shall invite you to the house again soon , said Mr . Godfrey , again addressing Herbert .  I am very much obliged to her , and to you , sir , said Herbert , modestly . I shall be very glad to come .  Toms face darkened , as he heard this . He would have given considerable to receive such an invitation himself , but the prospect did not seem very promising .  Mr . Godfrey must be infatuated , he said to himself , impatiently , to invite such a beggar to his house . Mason ought to have good sense enough to feel that he is out of place in such a house . I wouldnt accept any invitation given out of pity .  I wonder why Tom dislikes me so much ? thought Herbert . He certainly takes pains enough to show his feeling . Would it be different , I wonder , if he knew that I was his cousin ?  Herbert thought of mentioning to Mr . Godfrey that he had recovered three-quarters of the money of which he had been robbed . It would have been well if he had done so , but Mr . Godfrey seemed particularly engaged , and he thought it best not to interrupt him .     CHAPTER XXX  AN UNEXPECTED BLOW   Herbert felt happier than usual . He had recovered the greater part of his money , and thus was relieved from various inconveniences which had resulted from his straitened circumstances , He was the more elated at this , as it had seemed extremely improbable that the lost money would ever have found its way back to the pocket of its rightful owner . Then , he had a good place , and a salary sufficient to defray his modest expenses , and the prospect of promotion , if he should be faithful to the interests of his employer , as he firmly intended to be . It was agreeable , also , to reflect that he was in favor with Mr . Godfrey , who had thus far treated him with as much kindness as if he had been his own son .  There was , to be sure , the drawback of Toms enmity , but , as there was no good reason for this , he would not allow it to trouble him much , though , of course , it would have been more agreeable if all in the office had been his friends . He determined to take an early opportunity to write to his good friend , Dr . Kent , an account of his present position . He would have done so before , but had hesitated from the fear that in some way the intelligence would reach Abner Holden , whom he preferred to leave in ignorance of all that concerned him .  These thoughts passed through Herberts mind as he went about his daily work . Meanwhile , a painful experience awaited him , for which he was not in the least prepared .  About one oclock a gentleman entered the counting-room hastily , and said , Mr . Godfrey , I wonder whether I happened to leave my pocketbook anywhere about your office when I was here an hour ago ?  I dont think so . When did you miss it ?  A few minutes since . I went to a restaurant to get a lunch , and , on finishing it , felt for my pocketbook , and found it gone .  Was there much in it ?  No sum of any consequence . Between twenty and thirty dollars , I believe . There were , however , some papers of value , which I shall be sorry to lose .  I hardly think you could have left it here . However , I will inquire . Mr . Pratt , have you seen anything of Mr . Waltons pocketbook ?  No , sir , said the bookkeeper , promptly .  Herbert , have you seen it ?  No , sir , said our hero .  Thomas ?  Tom Stanton was assailed by a sudden and dangerous temptation . His dislike to Herbert had been increased in various ways , and especially had been rendered more intense by the independent tone assumed by our hero in the conversation which had taken place between them that very morning . Now , here was an opportunity of getting him into disgrace , and probably cause him to lose his situation . True , he would have to tell a falsehood , but Tom had never been a scrupulous lover of truth , and would violate it for a less object without any particular compunction .  He hesitated when the question was asked him , and thus , as he expected , fixed Mr . Godfreys attention .  Why dont you answer , Thomas ? he said , in surprise .  I dont like to , said Tom , artfully .  Why not ? demanded his employer , suspiciously .  Because I dont want to get anybody into trouble .  Speak out what you mean .  If you insist upon it , said Tom , with pretended reluctance , I suppose I must obey you .  Of course , if any wrong has been done , it is your duty to expose it .  Then , sir , said Tom . I saw Mason pick up a wallet from the floor , and put it in his pocket just after the gentleman went out . He did it so quickly that no one probably observed it but myself .  Herbert listened to this accusation as if stunned . It was utterly beyond his conception how anyone could be guilty of such a deliberate falsehood as he had just listened to . So he remained silent , and this operated against him .  Herbert , said Mr . Godfrey , mildly , for he was unwilling to believe our hero guilty of intentional dishonesty , you should have mentioned having found the pocketbook .  So I would , sir , said Herbert , having found his voice at last , if I had found one .  Do you mean to say that you have not ? demanded Mr . Godfrey , with a searching look .  Yes , sir , said Herbert , firmly .  What , then , does Thomas mean when he asserts that he saw you do so ?  I dont know , sir . I think he means to injure me , as I have noticed ever since I entered the office that he seems to dislike me .  How is that , Thomas ? Do you again declare that you saw Herbert pick up the wallet ?  I do , said Tom , boldly . Of course , I expected that he would deny it . I leave it to you , sir , if he does not show his guilt in his face ? Just look at him!  Now it , unfortunately for Herbert , happened that his indignation had brought a flush to his face , and he certainly did look as a guilty person is supposed to do . Mr . Godfrey observed this , and his heart sank within him , for , unable to conceive of such wickedness as Toms , he saw no other way except to believe in Herberts guilt .  Have you nothing to say , Herbert ? he asked , more in sorrow than in anger .  No , sir , said Herbert , in a low voice; nothing , except what I have already said . Tom has uttered a wicked falsehood , and he knows it .  Of course , I expected you would say that , said Tom , with effrontery .  This is a serious charge , Herbert , proceeded Mr . Godfrey . I shall have to ask you to produce whatever you have in your pockets .  Certainly , sir , said our hero , calmly .  But , as he spoke , it flashed upon him that he had in his pocket twenty-six dollars , and the discovery of this sum would be likely to involve him in suspicion . He could , indeed , explain where he got it; but would his explanation be believed ? Under present circumstances , he feared that it would not . So it was with a sinking heart that he drew out the contents of his pockets , and among them his own pocketbook .  Is that yours ? asked Mr . Godfrey , turning to Mr . Walton .  No , it is not; but he may have transferred my money to it .  Upon this hint , Mr . Godfrey opened the pocketbook , and drew out the small roll of bills , which he proceeded to count .  Twenty-six dollars , he said . How much did you lose ?  Between twenty and thirty dollars . I cannot be sure how much .  Here are two tens and three twos .  I had two tens . I dont remember the denomination of the other bills .  Even Tom was struck with astonishment at this discovery . He knew that his charge was groundless , yet here it was substantiated in a very remarkable manner . Was it possible that he had , after all , struck upon the truth of the matter ? He did not know what to think .  Herbert , said his employer , sorrowfully , this discovery gives me more pain than I can express . I had a very high idea of you . I could not have believed you capable of so mean a thing as deliberate dishonesty .  I am not guilty , said Herbert , proudly .  How can you say this in the face of all this evidence ? Do you mean to say that this money is yours ?  I do , said Herbert , firmly .  Where could you have got it ? said his employer , incredulously . Did you not tell me when you entered my employ that you were almost penniless ? You have been with me three weeks only , and half your wages have been paid for board .  Yes , sir; you are right .  What explanation , then , can you offer ? Your case looks bad .  The six dollars I saved from my wages , at the rate of two dollars a week . The twenty dollars is a part of the money I was robbed of . I succeeded in recovering forty dollars of it yesterday .  Here , Herbert related the circumstances already known to the reader .  A likely story , said Tom , scornfully .  Be silent , Thomas , said Mr . Godfrey . Your story does not seem probable , he proceeded , speaking to Herbert .  It is true , sir , said our hero , firmly .  What could he have done with your wallet , however ? said the merchant , turning to Mr . Walton .  He has been out to the post office since , said Tom . He might have thrown it away .  This unfortunately for Herbert , was true . He had been out , and , of course , could have disposed of the wallet in the way mentioned .  I dont know what to think , Mr . Walton , said Mr . Godfrey . Im afraid the boys guilty .  Im afraid so . I dont care so much for the money , if he will give me back the papers .  I cant do it , sir , said Herbert , for I never had them .  What shall we do ?  The other boy declares that he saw this one take the wallet from the floor , where I probably dropped it . It seems to me that settles the matter .  I am afraid it does .  Once more , Herbert , will you confess ? asked Mr . Godfrey .  I can only say , sir , that I am innocent .  Mr . Walton , what shall we do ?  Let the boy go . I will leave it to his honor to return me the papers , and he may keep the money . I think he will make up his mind to do so by tomorrow .  You hear , Herbert , said Mr . Godfrey . While this matter remains in doubt , you cannot retain your situation .  Thank you , Mr . Walton , for your indulgence , said Herbert; but I am sorry you think me guilty . The truth will some time appear . I shall TRY to do my duty , and TRUST to God to clear me .  He took his hat and left the counting-room with a heavy heart , feeling himself in disgrace .  I had great confidence in that boy , Walton , said Mr . Godfrey . Even now , I can hardly believe him guilty .     CHAPTER XXXI  MR . STANTON IS SURPRISED   While the events recorded in the last chapter were taking place in Mr . Godfreys counting-room another and a different scene took place at the office of Mr . Stanton .  He had just finished reading the morning paper , and , as it slipped from his hand , his thoughts turned , transiently , to the nephew whose persistent failure to claim relationship puzzled him not a little . He was glad not to be called upon for money , of course; still , he felt a little annoyed at Herberts reticence , especially as it left him unable to decide whether our hero knew of the tie which connected them . It was scarcely possible to suppose that he did not . But in that case , why did he not make some sign ? The truth did suggest itself to Mr . Stantons mind that the boy resented his cold and indifferent letter , and this thought made him feel a little uncomfortable .  While he was thinking over this subject , one of his clerks entered the office .  A gentleman to see you , Mr . Stanton , he said , briefly .  Mr . Stanton raised his head , and his glance rested on a tall , vigorous man of perhaps thirty-five years of age , who closely followed the clerk . The strangers face was brown from exposure , and there was a certain appearance of unconventionality about his movements which seemed to indicate that he was not a dweller in cities or a frequenter of drawing-rooms , but accustomed to make his home in the wilder haunts of nature .  In brief , for there is no occasion for mystery , Mr . Stantons visitor was Ralph the Ranger , who had assisted Herbert from the clutches of Abner Holden .  Mr . Stanton gazed at the stranger with some curiosity , but was unable to recognize him .  Have you any business with me ? he asked .  Yes , said the visitor , in a voice whose depth carried with it an assurance of strength .  State it , then , as briefly as possible , said the merchant , with a little asperity , for there was not as much deference in the manner of the other as he thought there should have been . Like most new men , he was jealous of his position , and solicitous lest he should not be treated with due respect .  I will do so , said the stranger , but as it cannot be summed up in a sentence , I will take the liberty of seating myself .  As he spoke he sat down in an office chair , which was placed not far from that in which Mr . Stanton was sitting .  My time is valuable , said the merchant , coldly . I cannot listen to a long story .  As the visitor was plainly , if not roughly , dressed , he suspected that he desired pecuniary assistance on some pretext or other , and that his story was one of misfortune , intended to appeal to his sympathies . Had such been the case , there was very little prospect of help from Mr . Stanton , and that gentleman already enjoyed in anticipation the pleasure of refusing him .  Dont you know me ? demanded Ralph , abruptly .  Mr . Stanton did not anticipate such a commencement . It had never occurred to him to suppose that his rough visitor was one whom he had ever before met .  No , he said , I never saw you before .  Ralph smiled a little bitterly .  So I have passed entirely out of your remembrance , have I ? he said . Well , it is twelve years since we met .  Twelve years , repeated Mr . Stanton . He scanned the strangers face with curiosity , but not a glimmer of recollection came to him .  I dare say I met many persons at that distance of time , whom I cannot remember in the least now , even by name .  I think you will remember my name , said Ralph , quietly . Your memory of Ralph Pendleton cannot be wholly obliterated .  Mr . Stanton started , and it was evident from the expression of his face that the memory was not a welcome one .  Are you Ralph Pendleton ? he asked , in an undecided voice .  Yes , but not the Ralph Pendleton you once knew . Then I was an inexperienced boy; now I am a man .  Yes , you have changed considerably , said Mr . Stanton , uncomfortably , Where have you kept yourself all these years ? Why have you not made yourself known before ?  Before I answer these questions , I must refer to some circumstances well known to both of us . I hope I shall not be tiresome; I will , at least , be brief . You were my fathers friend . At least , he so considered you .  I was so .  When he died , as I had not yet attained my majority , he left you my guardian .  Yes .  I was in rather an idle frame , and being possessed , as I supposed , of fifty thousand dollars , I felt no necessity impelling me to work . You gave me no advice , but rather encouraged me in my idle propensities . When I was of age , I took a fancy to travel , and left my property in your hands , with full power to manage it for me . This trust you accepted .  Well , this is an old story .  An old one , but it shall not be a long one . My income being sufficient to defray my expenses abroad , I traveled leisurely , with no thought for the future . In your integrity I had the utmost confidence . Imagine , then , my dismay when , while resident in Paris , I received a letter from you stating that , owing to a series of unlucky investments , nearly all my money had been sunk , and in place of fifty thousand dollars , my property was reduced to a few hundreds .  It was unlucky , I admit , said Mr . Stanton , moving uneasily in his chair . My investments were unlucky , as it turned out , but the best and most judicious cannot always foresee how an investment will turn out . Besides , I lost largely , myself .  So you wrote me , said Ralph , quietly . However , that did not make it any the easier for me to bear .  Perhaps not , but it shows , at any rate , that I took the same risk for my own money that I did for others .  Ralph proceeded without noticing this remark . What made matters worse for me was that I had fallen in love with a young American lady who , with her parents , was then traveling in Europe . My circumstances , as I supposed them to be , justified me in proposing marriage . I was accepted by the young lady , and my choice was approved by the parents . When , however , I learned of my loss of fortune , I at once made it known , and that approval was withdrawn . The father told me that , under the altered circumstances , the engagement must be considered broken . Still , he held out the prospect that , should I ever again obtain a property as large as that I had lost , I might marry his daughter . She , on her part , promised to wait for me .  Well ?  I came to New York , received from you the remnant of my lost fortune , and sailed the next week for California , then just open to American enterprise . The most glowing stories were told of fortunes won in an incredibly short time , Having no regular occupation , and having a strong motive for acquiring money , it is not surprising that I should have been dazzled with the rest , and persuaded to make the journey to the land of gold .  A Quixotic scheme , as I thought at the time , said Mr . Stanton , coldly . For one that succeeded , there were fifty who failed . You had better have taken the clerkship I offered you .  You are wrong , said Ralph , composedly . There were many who were disappointed , but I was not among the number .  Did you succeed ? asked Mr . Stanton , surprised .  So well , answered the other , that at the end of two years residence , I found myself as rich as I had ever been .  Had you made fifty thousand dollars ? demanded the merchant , in amazement .  I had .  What did you do ? Why did you not let me know of your success ?  When I once more found myself possessed of a fortune , I took the next vessel home with my money . I had but one thought , and that was to claim the hand of my promised bride , who had promised to wait for me ten years , if necessary .  Well ?  I found her married , said Ralph , bitterly . She had forgotten her promise , or had been over-persuaded by her parents--I do not know which--and had proved false to me .  That was unfortunate . But do you still possess the money ?  I do .  Indeed! I congratulate you , said Mr . Stanton , with suavity , and he held out his hand , which Ralph did not appear to see . Ralph Pendleton rich was a very different person from Ralph Pendleton poor , and it occurred to him that he might so far ingratiate himself into the favor of his former ward as to obtain the charge of his second fortune . He saw that it would be safe , as well as politic , to exchange his coldness for a warm and cordial welcome .  Proceed with your story , he said; I am quite interested in it .     CHAPTER XXXII  RISEN FROM THE DEAD   Ralph Pendleton proceeded .  This blow overwhelmed me . All that I had been laboring for seemed suddenly snatched from me .  You had your money , suggested Mr . Stanton .  Yes , I had my money; but for money itself I cared little .  Mr . Stanton shrugged his shoulders a little contemptuously . He could not understand how anyone could think slightingly of money , and he decided in his own mind that Ralph was an unpractical enthusiast .  I valued money only as a means to an end , and that end was to make Margaret Lindsay my wife . She failed me , and my money lost its charm .  There were plenty who could have consoled you in her place .  No doubt , I might have been successful in other quarters , but I did not care to try . I left New York in disgust , and , going West , I buried myself in the forest , where I built a rude cabin , and there I have lived since , an unsocial , solitary life . Years have passed since I visited New York .  What did you do with your money all this while ?  I left it in the hands of men whom I could trust . It has been accumulating all these years , and I find that the fifty thousand dollars have swelled to ninety thousand .  Indeed! ejaculated Mr . Stanton , his respect for Ralph considerably raised . And now you have come here to enjoy it , I suppose ?  A different motive has led to my coming--a motive connected with you , said Ralph , fixing his eyes steadily upon Mr . Stanton .  Connected with me! repeated the merchant , uneasily .  Yes .  May I ask in what manner ?  I expected the question , and am come to answer it . When I returned from Europe impoverished , you gave me a brief statement of the manner in which you had invested my fortune , and showed me how it had melted away like snow before the sun .  You remember rightly . I bought , on your account , shares in Lake Superior Mining Company , which promised excellently , and bade fair to make handsome returns . But it proved to be under the management of knaves , and ran quickly down from par to two per cent . , at which price I thought best to sell out , considering that a little saved from the wreck was better than nothing .  This is according to the statement you made me , said Ralph , quietly .  I am sure , said Mr . Stanton , that no one regretted more than I do the disastrous result . Indeed , I had reason to do so , for I was myself involved , and suffered considerable loss .  I am aware now that you were concerned in the matter , said Ralph , significantly .  What do you mean ? asked Mr . Stanton , quickly , detecting something peculiar in his tone .  I will tell you . You were right in denouncing the management as knavish . The company was got up by knaves , on a basis of fraud , and was from the first intended as a trap for the unwary . But there is one important circumstance which you have neglected to mention .  What is that ? asked Mr . Stanton , in a voice which strove to be composed .  I mean this , said Ralph , firmly , that you yourself were the prime originator of the company--that you engineered it through to the end--that you invested my money with the express intention of converting it to your own profit . I charge you with this , that all , or nearly all the property I lost , went into your pocket .  The color came and went in Mr . Stantons face . He seemed staggered by this sudden and unexpected accusation , and did not at first make reply .  Feeling forced to speak at last , he said: This is very strange language , Mr . Pendleton .  It is unexpected , no doubt , for after all these years you probably thought it would remain forever unknown; but in what respect is it strange ? I have given you a statement of facts as directly as I could .  They are not facts . Your charge is wholly false , said the merchant , but his tone was not that of a man who speaks the truth boldly .  I wish I could believe it , said Ralph . I wish I could believe that I was not deliberately swindled by one who professed to be my fathers friend .  On what authority do you bring this monstrous charge ? demanded Mr . Stanton , more boldly . How happens it that you have not made it before ?  For the simple reason that I myself did not suspect any fraud . I presumed that it was as you stated to me , and that your only fault was your injudicious investment .  Well , I admit that , as it turned out , the investment was injudicious . Everything else I deny .  Your denial is vain .  You cannot prove the truth of what you say .  So you fall back on that ? But you are mistaken . I can prove the truth of what I say , said Ralph firmly .  How ?  Do you remember a man named David Marston ?  He is dead , said Mr . Stanton , hastily .  So you have supposed , said Ralph; but you were deceived . He is not dead . I only encountered him a week since , quite by accident , in my Western home . He was your confidential clerk , you remember , and fully acquainted with all your business transactions at the time of which I am speaking . From him I learned how basely I had been deceived , and with what deliberate cruelty you conspired to rob the son of your dead friend .  I dont believe David Marston is alive , said Mr . Stanton , hoarsely , with a certain terror in his face . Indeed , I have proof that he is dead .  I know the character of your proof . A paper was forwarded to you from Australia , whither you had sent him , containing the record of his death .  Yes ? What have you to say against this ?  That the publication was a mistake . He was dangerously sick , and it was falsely announced that he was dead . That notice was sent to you , and you believed it to be true .  I believe it now , said Mr . Stanton , doggedly . Why should I not ?  If you wish to be convinced , proof is at hand . Wait a moment .  Ralph Pendleton rose from his seat and left the counting-room . Two minutes had not passed when he returned with an elderly man , thin of face and wasted in figure , looking twenty years older than Mr . Stanton , though really of about the same age .  This is David Marston , said Ralph--the living proof that I have told you the truth .  Mr . Stanton gazed at him wildly , for to him it was as the face of one risen from the dead .  How do you do , Mr . Stanton ? said David Marston , humbly . It is many , many years since we met , sir .  Are you really David Marston ? demanded Mr . Stanton , never taking his eyes off the shrunken figure of his old clerk .  I am , sir; greatly changed indeed , but still the David Marston who was formerly in your employ . Time hasnt treated me as well as it has you , sir . Ive been unlucky , and aged fast .  I am afraid your mind is also affected . You have been telling strange stories to Mr . Pendleton here .  True stories , sir , said David , firmly .  Come , come , how much is he going to give you for this evidence of yours ?  Stop , Mr . Stanton! You insult us both , said Ralph Pendleton , sternly . I am not the man to buy false evidence , nor is David Marston the man to perjure himself for pay . David , I want you , in Mr . Stantons presence , to make a clear statement of his connection with the mining company by which I lost my fortune .  David Marston obeyed , and in a few words as possible unfolded the story . It is not necessary to repeat it here . Enough that it fully substantiated the charge which Ralph had brought against his early guardian .  When he had finished , Ralph said , You can judge what weight Marstons testimony would have before a court of justice , and whether it would help your commercial standing to have his story made public .  What is it you want of me ? said Mr . Stanton , sullenly .  I want restitution , dollar for dollar , of my lost money . I will waive interest , though I might justly claim it . But , were it all paid , interest and principal , the wrong would not be redressed . You cannot restore the bride who would have been mine but for your villainy .  How much time will you give me to pay this money ? asked the merchant , moodily .  Ten days .  It is a short time .  It must suffice . Do you agree ?  I must .  Bind yourself to that , and for ten days I leave you free .  Satisfactory security was given that the engagement would be met , and Ralph Pendleton left the counting-room . But his countenance was scarcely more cheerful than that of the man he had conquered .  I am rich , he said to himself; but of what avail is it ? Whom can I benefit with my wealth ?  This thought had scarcely crossed his mind when he came face to face with Herbert , walking with a sad and downcast face in the opposite direction .     CHAPTER XXXIII  A FRIEND IN NEED   Herbert left Mr . Godfreys counting-room very much depressed in spirits . But an hour before he had rejoiced in his excellent prospects , and , depending on the favor of his employer and his own fidelity , had looked forward to a bright future . Now all was changed . He was dismissed from his situation in disgrace , suspected of a mean theft . He had , to be sure , the consciousness of innocence , and that was a great deal . He was not weighed down by the feeling of guilt , at least . Still his prospects were dark . Suppose the matter should not be cleared up , and he should still remain under suspicion ? How could he hope to obtain another place without a recommendation from his late employer ? No; he must resign all hope of a position and adopt some street occupation , such as selling papers or vending small articles in a basket , as he had seen boys of his own age doing . He did not doubt but that in some way he could get a living , but still he would be under suspicion , and that was hard to bear .  While these things were passing through his mind he walked down Broadway , with his eyes fixed upon the sidewalk . All at once he started to hear his name called , and , looking up , to his unbounded astonishment he saw before him Ralph the Ranger , whom he had supposed a thousand miles away in his cabin in the Ohio woods .  The sight of a friendly face was most welcome to him at such a time , and Ralphs face was friendly .  Ralph! he exclaimed , seizing the Rangers hand . How did you come here ? When did you arrive ? You are the last person I expected to see .  And you are the one I most wanted to see , said Ralph , his tone unconsciously softened by his friendly interest in the boy before him .  I can say the same , Ralph , said Herbert , soberly , for I am in trouble .  In trouble , boy ? I am sorry for that . Is it money ? I can get you out of that trouble .  It is not that exactly , Ralph . If you will come into the City Hall Park and sit down on a bench with me I will tell you all about it .  Instead of that , let us go into the Astor House , said Ralph . It is where I am stopping .  You are stopping at the Astor House ? said Herbert , in momentary surprise . Perhaps you do not know that there are cheaper hotels . Shall I direct you to one ?  No , Herbert , I am not poor , as you perhaps think . I suppose I should be called rich; but that I can explain afterwards . For the present your affairs require attention . Come in .  They went up the steps of the Astor House , and Ralph led the way to his room , an apartment of good size and handsomely furnished .  Now , Herbert , take a chair and tell me all , he said .  To repeat Herberts story here is unnecessary . Ralph listened with attention , and when it was concluded he said: The main thing is to account for the money in your possession . Do you think you should remember the policeman who aided you in recovering your money ?  I am sure I should .  Did he know how much money you recovered ?  Yes , for he saw me count the bills .  Then we must seek him out and induce him to go with us to Mr . Godfreys counting-room and give his testimony .  I never thought of that , said Herbert , his face brightening . When shall we go ?  Now . I have nothing else to occupy me , and the sooner you are righted the better .  They went out together , and made their way at once to the spot where Herbert had encountered Greenleaf . They had to wait but a brief time when the policeman came up .  Do you remember me ? asked Herbert , going up to him .  Yes , he replied; you are the boy that overhauled a thief the other day , and got back his money .  You see , he remembers , said Herbert , with satisfaction .  My friend , said Ralph , when will you be off duty ?  In half an hour , said the policeman , in surprise .  In half an hour , then , I want you to go with me to this boys employer and repeat your story . The possession of the money has caused him to be suspected , and your evidence , confirming his own , will clear him of having obtained it improperly .  I will go , said the officer , and shall be glad to get him out of a scrape . It was all fair and above-board , and Ill say so cheerfully .  At the end of the half hour the three made their way to Mr . Godfreys place of business and entered together .  Mr . Godfrey marked their entrance with surprise , and looked inquiringly at Herbert .  Mr . Godfrey , said Herbert , respectfully , I have come to prove to you that the money I have in my pocketbook is my own .  I shall be very glad if you can do so , said Mr . Godfrey; and it was evident from his manner that he spoke sincerely .  This officer knows all the circumstances , and will tell you what he knows .  The policeman made his statement , partly in answer to questions from Mr . Godfrey .  The explanation is satisfactory , said Mr . Godfrey , and convinces me . It does not , however , absolutely clear you , since between the time of the money being lost and your being searched you went out to the post office , and you might have disposed of the pocketbook and its contents on the way .  Herberts countenance fell , but Mr . Godfrey hastened to add . Although your vindication is not complete , I will say that I believe you fully , and will receive you back into my employ .  You have forgotten one thing , sir , said Herbert . Thomas declares that he saw me pick up the wallet and put it in my pocket .  So I did , said Tom , boldly .  Mr . Godfrey looked perplexed , and was hesitating what to say when Mr . Walton , the owner of the lost pocketbook , hurriedly entered .  Mr . Godfrey , he said , I have to beg your pardon , and , most of all , the pardon of this boy , indicating Herbert . I have found my pocketbook . I didnt lose it here , but my pocket was picked in the street . The pickpocket was arrested , and the wallet has been returned to me . This boy is innocent .  I am very glad to hear it , said Mr . Godfrey , with emphasis . Herbert , I will try to make amends to you for my transient suspicions of your honesty . As for you , he continued , turning to Thomas and speaking sternly , I despise you for your mean attempt to injure your fellow-clerk . You must leave my employment to-day . I shall write to your father the reasons for dismissing you .  I can get along without your paltry four dollars a week , said Tom , with bravado . I am not a beggar .  You may be something worse , if you do not amend , said Mr . Godfrey . Mr . Pratt , you may pay him for the entire week , and he can go at once .  Although Tom professed so much disdain for the four dollars a week , he did not decline the weeks pay directed to be paid to him , but placed the money in his vest pocket and went out with assumed nonchalance , though , in reality , deeply mortified at the unexpected discovery of his meanness .  As for you , Herbert , said Mr . Godfrey , you can come back at once , and I will raise your pay to eight dollars a week . I owe you some reparation for the injury you came so near suffering . I will never again doubt your integrity .  Thank you , sir , said Herbert; I shall be glad to come back .  Before this matter is decided , said Ralph , I have a proposition to make to Herbert . I am rich , and have no one to share or inherit my wealth . I propose to adopt him--to give him an opportunity to complete his education in Europe , whither I propose going , and if some years hence you shall be willing to receive him , he can then enter your counting-room to learn business . The amount of compensation will be unimportant , as I shall provide for him amply .  Herbert stared at Ralph in amazement . He could hardly realize that the offer was indeed a genuine one .  Do you mean that I am to go to Europe with you , Ralph ? he said .  Yes , if you like .  I shall like it VERY MUCH , said Herbert , enthusiastically . How can I thank you for so much generous kindness!  Your companionship will cheer me , and give me something to live for , Herbert , said Ralph . Through you I hope some day to enjoy life again .  Herberts clasped the Rangers hand in impulsive gratitude , while his face beamed with pleasure .  I congratulate you , Herbert , said Mr . Godfrey , kindly , though I am sorry to lose you . Whenever your guardian is ready to have you enter on a business career , a place in my counting-room shall be open to you .  Ralph , said Herbert , seriously , as they went from the counting-room in company , all that has happened seems so wonderful that I am a little afraid I shall wake up to find it all a dream .  It is a change to me also , said Ralph , to have a new interest in life . The past is a sealed book . Let us look forward to a bright and pleasant future . Whatever pleasures and advantages money can obtain for you shall be yours .  Thank you , said Herbert , gratefully .     CHAPTER XXXIV  CONCLUSION   Where are you boarding , Herbert ? asked Ralph .  In Stanton Street .  I shall wish you at once to remove to the Astor House , in order that we may be together until we sail for Europe .  To this pleasant arrangement Herbert made no opposition . He found it a great change from the dirty and slipshod boarding-house to the elegant arrangements of a first-class hotel . It is needless to say that he enjoyed that change not a little . He often had the feeling , of which he had spoken to Ralph , that it was a dream from which he would some time awake . But the dream was destined to be a pretty long one .  Within a week , much against his will , Mr . Stanton paid over to Ralph Pendleton the fifty thousand dollars of which he had years ago defrauded him , and thus the Ranger found himself master of a fortune of nearly one hundred and fifty thousand dollars . He settled without delay a comfortable annuity on David Marston , the old clerk , through whose evidence he had been able to ferret out the treachery of Mr . Stanton . Marston needed it , for his health was broken down and he was an invalid , prematurely old . He is now settled in a comfortable boarding-house in Clinton Street , and usually spends his mornings at the Mercantile Library Reading-Room , in Astor Place , reading the morning papers . Sometimes he ventures downtown , and takes a slow walk through the streets , crowded with busy , bustling men , and recalls the years when he , too , was one of them .  Before sailing for Europe , Herbert expressed a desire to repay his uncle the sum of ten dollars , which the latter had sent to him . Ralph was surprised when he learned that this uncle , of whom Herbert spoke , was the same man who had been his former guardian . He approved our heros determination , and one morning Herbert entered for the first time his uncles place of business .  Is Mr . Stanton in ? he asked of a clerk .  The clerk , in reply , pointed to the office .  Herbert entered .  His uncle looked up , but although he had seen our hero at a concert at the Academy of Music , he did not recognize him in the new and fashionable suit which Ralph had purchased for him .  Mr . Stanton , I suppose ? said Herbert , with quiet self-possession .  Yes . Do you wish to speak with me ?  I must introduce myself , said Herbert . I am Herbert Mason , your nephew .  Indeed! said Mr . Stanton , surprised . When did you come to the city ?  Some weeks since .  What brought you here ?  I had my living to make . I preferred to make it in the city .  The city is crowded . You had better have remained in the country .  I do not think so , said Herbert .  You could have got a place on a farm , and in time perhaps might have bought a little land for yourself .  Herbert smiled .  I did get a place on a farm , he said; but I did not like it .  What are you doing in the city ? Have you got a place ?  Not at present .  So I supposed , said his uncle , frowning . I told you the city was overcrowded . You should not have come here . I suppose you relied on me to help you to something . But I have my own family to take care of , and my first duty is to them , as you must be aware .  I dont think you quite understand my object in calling , said Herbert , quietly . I have not come for assistance of any kind .  Indeed! returned Mr . Stanton , appearing to be puzzled .  You sent me ten dollars in a letter to Dr . Kent some months since ?  Yes . I felt that it was best for you to depend on yourself , and that more would only encourage you to idleness .  I have come to thank you for the LOAN , said Herbert , emphasizing the last word , and to return the money .  What! exclaimed Mr . Stanton , now thoroughly amazed .  Herbert repeated his former words .  But I dont understand this . You are out of a place; yet you do not need this money .  No , I do not need it .  This was certainly astonishing , and Mr . Stanton gazed at his nephew as if he did not know what to make of it .  What are your plans ? he asked . What are you going to do ?  I sail for Europe next week , said Herbert , enjoying his uncles surprise .  Sail for Europe! ejaculated Mr . Stanton , scarcely believing his ears .  Yes , I am to go to school there , and shall probably remain three or four years .  You are trifling with me , said his uncle , irritably . How can you go to Europe without money ?  Herbert felt that the time had come for an explanation .  A friend , he said , kindly undertakes to pay all my expenses . I go with him .  Who is your friend ?  Mr . Ralph Pendleton . I believe you know him .  Ralph Pendleton! repeated Mr . Stanton , in renewed surprise . How did you become acquainted with him ?  The farmer with whom I was placed in Ohio ill-treated me . Ralph lived near by , and helped me to run away .  Mr . Stanton made no comment . Indeed , his surprise was such that he knew not what to say . His friendless and penniless nephew , as he had regarded him , was about to share advantages which he would gladly have obtained for his own son . When , that evening , at home , he told his family of Herberts good fortune , Tom was filled with bitter envy . If it had been any other boy he would have cared less , but for that begger Herbert to go to Europe in charge of a man of wealth was very mortifying to his pride .  Mr . Stanton made a faint protest against receiving the ten dollars tendered by his nephew , but Herbert was determined to repay it . He placed it on the desk and eventually Mr . Stanton placed it in his pocketbook .  After some reflection , finding his nephew very differently situated from what he had supposed , Mr . Stanton , with the concurrence of his wife , whose opinion also had been changed , sent an invitation to Ralph and Herbert to dine with them previous to their sailing for Europe . Herbert , by his new guardians direction , returned a polite reply , to the effect that they were too busy in making preparations for their departure to accept the invitation . Ralph did not feel like sitting as the guest of a man who had cruelly defrauded him , and had only done him justice when he was actually compelled to do so .  In due time our hero sailed for Europe with Mr . Ralph Pendleton . They divided their time between Paris and Berlin , Herbert studying at both places . With his natural good abilities , he made rapid progress , and at the end of four years was an accomplished scholar , able to speak both French and German with facility . In watching his progress , Ralph Pendleton found a new and fresh interest in life . He recovered from his old , morbid feeling , and became cheerful and happy . On returning to New York , Herbert , who felt that he should enjoy a life of business better than a professional career , entered the counting-room of Mr . Godfrey . At twenty-one , the junior partner retiring , he was received as partner in his place , his guardian , Ralph Pendleton , purchasing an interest for him at a cost of fifty thousand dollars . He developed good business abilities , and bid fair to swell this sum , in time , to a large fortune . There is a prospect that he will , in time , sustain a closer relation to his senior partner , as it is rumored that Julia Godfrey , now a brilliant young belle , prefers her fathers young partner to any of the crowd of young men who pay her court .  The other characters in our story demand a few closing words . First , for Mr . Stanton . It might have been the sudden withdrawal of the fifty thousand dollars from his business that embarrassed him . At any rate , from that time nothing prospered with him . He met with loss after loss , until , in a time of financial panic he failed . He saved but a little from the wreck of his fortune , That little started him in a modest business , yielding him , perhaps , one-tenth his former income . The brownstone house was sold . He moved into a shabby house in an obscure street , where Mrs . Stanton spends her time mostly in bewailing the loss of her former splendor .  Tom developed habits of extravagance , and seemed indisposed to work steadily . Finally , when his reverses came , his father was compelled to refuse further assistance , and now Tom , in an inferior clerkship , on a small salary , gazes with envy at his once-despised cousin , with whom he has completely changed places . How he will come out eventually is doubtful . Unless he changes considerably , it is not likely that his circumstances will ever be much better than at present .  Abner Holden died suddenly last year in a fit of delirium tremens . His habits of intemperance grew upon him until they led to this sad result . His death did not excite any very prolonged grief in the community , as his temper and uncertain honesty had made him very far from popular . To the housekeeper who had been kind to him , Herbert sent a valuable silk dress , of the richest fabric , of which Mrs . Bickford is very proud . She only wears it on great occasions , and then is particular to mention that it was presented to her by Herbert Mason , of the great New York firm of Godfrey & Mason , who was once Abner Holdens bound boy .  Nor was Herbert forgetful of his good friends , the Kents . He paid off the mortgage on the doctors place , and insisted on putting the house in thorough repair , and newly furnishing it , so that now the town of Waverley does not contain a handsomer house , inside and out , than that of Dr . Kent .  So we bid farewell to our young hero , fairly launched on a prosperous career , trusting that his life-path may be bright to the end , and that he may leave behind him , at the end of his career , the reputation of a noble and honorable merchant , and a life filled with good deeds .
